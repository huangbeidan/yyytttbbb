    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS, A REPRESENTATIVEIN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;The subcommittee will come to order. I will
recognize myself for 5 minutes for an opening statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I want to thank everyone for being here today. We are going 
to talk about the U.S. drug supply and the complex way it is 
interwoven with multiple stakeholders involved in each step of 
the process. Improving access to lifesaving treatments for 
consumers and patients should be a nonpartisan priority for 
every person in the room. Two weeks ago, the Health 
Subcommittee held a hearing on the implementation of the 21st 
Century Cures Act. We heard testimonies from officials at the 
helm of the National Institute of Health and the Food and Drug 
Administration about the law's transformative impact on 
maintaining our nation's global leadership in biomedical 
innovation. Built into that very concept is the expectation 
that innovative and breakthrough treatments will get developed, 
approved, and introduced into the therapeutic market to cure 
diseases or effectively manage chronic conditions so people 
lead healthier, fuller lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Today's hearing will serve as an important educational 
opportunity to better understand the intricacies of our 
nation's drug supply chain. To help us work toward that goal, 
we will hear from a diverse group of representatives--ten to be 
exact--that represent many facets of the supply chain process, 
and I do want to welcome each of you to the subcommittee this 
morning. It is my hope that our discussion today is substantive 
and will be focused on the patients who are prescribed these 
medications because, at the end of the day, it is the patients 
who matter most in our conversation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Practicing medicine, I cared most about prescribing for my 
patients a drug that was efficacious and safe, and really not 
wanting to think too much whether or not they would be able to 
fill their prescription at the pharmacy. But now, the 
conversation has shifted to a complicated back and forth 
between doctors, patients, insurance companies, pharmacies 
about drug co-pays, prior authorizations, drug formularies, 
step therapies, amongst other things. Over the last few years, 
we have also learned about acquisitions and mergers within the 
various drug supply chain as companies seek out increased 
integration of their operations with an eye towards more 
efficiencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Prescription drugs continue to play a vital role in the 
United States health care system. From significantly improving 
patients' lives to producing health care savings through fewer 
hospitalizations and medical procedures. A patient's access to 
prescription drugs is a key health care issue for Americans and 
within that context now the debate is over affordability.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I will be frank with you. I expect disagreement this 
morning. But while there are legitimate differences of opinion, 
I recognize that every participant here this morning does 
aspire to the common goal of saving lives and alleviating human 
suffering. And so out of these areas of disagreement, I hope to 
begin to identify areas of consensus so that we can begin 
delivering solutions to the problems that we do identify this 
morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;These stakeholders here include pharmaceutical 
manufacturers that primarily research, develop, and produce 
brand name and generic drugs, biologic, and biosimilars. These 
medicines treat a spectrum of diseases and conditions from 
allergies, infections, hypertension to cancer, diabetes, and 
rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Next, the pharmaceutical wholesalers purchase these drugs 
and store them in regional distribution centers for delivery 
points that include our pharmacies, our supermarket retailers, 
hospitals, physician groups, and other health care providers. 
Wholesalers also provide other ancillary services such as 
repackaging, consulting, inventory management, and patient 
discount programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Overall, pharmacy benefit managers manage prescription drug 
benefits on behalf of employer-sponsored health plans, health 
maintenance organizations, state and federal health programs 
including Medicare Part D, and Medicaid-managed care plans. 
These managers impact the lives of 226 million insured 
Americans with most of them enrolled in private health plans. 
So they have a special role in the drug supply chain that 
includes determining payments and pricing for drugs, processing 
pharmacy drug claims, negotiating rebates and discounts from 
drug manufacturers, designing drug plan formularies, and 
operating mail order businesses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Retail pharmacies have a large neighborhood presence 
representing large drug store chains, pharmacy departments in 
local supermarkets and big box retailers, and independent 
community pharmacies that occupy a unique and essential role 
within the drug supply chain. Many drug stores contract with 
payors and pharmacy benefit managers to join health plan 
pharmacy networks. Some larger pharmacy chains have also 
entered into joint ventures with PBMs and insurers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Finally, private health insurance plans are likely 
recognized by most Americans to have a direct impact on their 
ability to access prescription drugs, largely due to the 
dictates of federal laws such as the Affordable Care Act on 
benefit requirements and out-of-pocket spending limits. They 
employ utilization controls to manage cost such as multi-tier 
drug formularies, step therapies, prior authorizations for 
certain high-cost brand name medicines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Again, I want to welcome all of our witnesses here today. 
As you see, we have the entire panoply of the supply chain here 
before us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Michael C. Burgess&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Michael C. Burgess"&gt;I look forward to your testimony and we will recognize Mr. 
Green of Texas, the ranking member of the subcommittee, 5 
minutes for an opening statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Michael C. Burgess"&gt;The Subcommittee will come to order.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Michael C. Burgess"&gt;The Chair will recognize himself for an opening statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Michael C. Burgess"&gt;The multifaceted nature of the current U.S. drug supply 
chain system is complex and interwoven with multiple 
stakeholders involved in each step of the process. Improving

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GENE GREEN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GENE GREEN"&gt;    I again want to welcome our witnesses and thank you for 
being here. I look forward to your testimony.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our
witnesses for being here this morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Too many Americans face real barriers in accessing the 
medications they need. Annual drug spending in the U.S. is 
expected to reach more than $500 billion by 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;In 2015, the rise in prescription drug spending outpaced 
all other health care services, surpassing hospital care as 
well as physician and clinical services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;While new life changing and lifesaving therapies continue 
to enter the market each year, patients must be able to afford 
these treatments in order to benefit from these breakthroughs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;The issue of high drug costs is not a simple challenge with 
a simple solution. Instances of bad actors buying up off-patent 
generic drugs with only one manufacturer astronomically jacking 
up the price has posed one type of challenge while breakthrough 
treatments capable of curing previously incurable disease but 
will have staggering price tags poses a different one.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;These challenges are magnified by the proliferation of the 
high deductible plans which expose more and more consumers to 
the full list of their medications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;We have a responsibility to explore the full spectrum of 
the supply chain to protect patients which are distinct for 
generic and brand name drugs and frustratingly complex.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;The United States leads the world in biomedical 
development, but having 21st Century Cures means much less if 
people cannot access because of the high prices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;It's important to also recognize that pharmaceutical 
companies sponsor the research that leads to these advances. We 
must find a workable solution that incentivizes competition in 
the pharmaceutical marketplace, reward value, and encourage the 
development of these affordable and high quality drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;We must also monitor steep prescription drug price 
increases when they rise, particularly when no additional 
research or development has occurred.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;There are a number of policy proposals that are represented 
to address the issue of high prescription drug costs. 
Transparency and value-based approaches are some of the keys to 
market-based reforms that will lead to better prices, continued 
investment in research and development, and ensure that 
taxpayers receive a real return on their investment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;I want to note that in pursuit of the lower drug prices, 
Congress must be careful to avoid the policies that will 
diminish patient safety.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Filling out an application to the FDA is one step in what 
can be a decades-long process to get from the lab table to the 
bedside.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Proposals that would lower FDA safety and effective 
standards effectively outsource FDA oversight to other 
countries, push the stage of three trials into the post-
approval space are unlikely to translate into meaningful 
savings for customers and are likely to put patients at risk.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Making the FDA approval process as sophisticated and 
efficient as it can be is one thing, but rolling back patient 
protections in the name of lower drug prices is not an 
acceptable path.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;We should be looking on how we pay for drugs and reward 
real value in the order of safety and meaningful, address the 
rising costs of prescription drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Following our bipartisan work on the 21st Century Cures 
Act, our recent work to reauthorize the FDA user fee programs, 
it is my hope that we can advance bipartisan policies to 
address rising drug costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;This problem demands a bipartisan and thoughtful process 
that includes a full spectrum of stakeholders. The American 
people expect us to work together to find answers and I believe 
we can do so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;I want to thank you for being here today and look forward 
to the day's discussion. And Mr. Chairman, I have one more 
minute. I'd like--anybody would like to have a minute? No? OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;    I'd like to ask unanimous consent to place into the record, 
Mr. Chairman, a letter from AARP.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Without objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;Annual drug spending in the U.S. is expected to reach more 
than $500 billion by 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;In 2015, the rise prescription drug spending outpaced all 
other health care services, surpassing hospital care as well as 
physician and clinical services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;While new life-changing and life-saving therapies continue 
to enter the market each year, patients must be able to afford 
these treatments in order to benefit from these breakthroughs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;The issue of high drug costs is not a simple challenge with 
a simple solution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;Instances of bad actors buying up off-patent generic drugs 
only made by one manufacturer and astronomically jacking up the 
price poses one type of challenge, while breakthrough 
treatments capable of curing previously un-curable disease but 
have a staggering price tag poses a different one.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;These challenges are magnified by the proliferation of 
high-deductible plans, which expose more and more consumers to 
the full list price of their medications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;We have a responsibility to explore the full spectrum of 
the supply chain to protect patients, which are distinct for 
generic and brand-name drugs, and frustratingly complex.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;The United States leads the world in biomedical 
development, but having 21st century cures means much less if 
people cannot access them because of high prices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;It is important to also recognize that pharmaceutical 
companies sponsor the research that leads to these advances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;We must find workable solutions that incentivize 
competition in the pharmaceutical marketplace, reward value, 
and encourage the development of affordable and high quality 
drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;We must also monitor steep prescription drug price 
increases when they arise, particularly when no additional 
research and development has occurred.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;There are a number of policy proposals that have been 
presented to address the issue of high prescription drug costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;Transparency and value-based approaches are some of the 
keys to market-based reforms that will lead to better prices, 
continued investment in research and development, and ensure 
that taxpayers receive a real return on their investment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;I want to note that in the pursuit of lower drug prices, 
Congress must be careful to avoid policies that will diminish 
patient safety.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;Filing an application with the FDA is the last step in what 
can be a decade's long process to get from the lab table to the 
bedside.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;Proposals that would lower FDA safety and effective 
standards, effectively outsource FDA oversight to other 
countries, or push stagethree trials into the post-approval 
space are unlikely to translate into meaning savings for 
consumers and are likely put patients at risk.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;Making the FDA approval process as sophisticated and 
efficient as it can be is one thing, but rolling back patient 
protections in the name of lower drug prices is not an 
acceptable path.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;We should be looking at how we pay for drugs, and reward 
real value in order to safely and meaningfully address the 
rising costs of prescription drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;Following our bipartisan work on the 21st Century Cures Act 
and our recent work to reauthorize the FDA user fee programs, 
it is my hope that we can advance bipartisan policies to 
address rising drug costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;This problem demands a bipartisan, thoughtful process that 
includes the full spectrum of stakeholders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Hon. Gene Green"&gt;The American people expect us to work together to find 
answers and I believe we can do so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREG WALDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GREG WALDEN"&gt;    Thank you all for being here today, and I look forward to 
today's discussion.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Dr. Burgess, thank you for holding this
important discussion. I appreciate your comments and those of 
Mr. Green's about the full set of issues before us and the 
overwhelming desire by our constituents that we dive deep into 
the whole drug chain and figure out how we can put consumers 
first not only in developing new medicines and new innovation 
and better pricing as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;As Mr. Green mentioned, this community unanimously 
reauthorized and the president signed into law the FDA 
Modernization Act. This committee last Congress championed the 
21st Century Cures Act with Congresswoman DeGette and 
Congressman Upton at the helm of that, celebrating its one-year 
anniversary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;But, clearly, there is more to be done, and as chairman of 
the committee, I felt it was really important that we hear from 
the entire sector from the development of new drugs to the 
final end place where we buy them, we consume them, we use 
them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;For more than 4 years, members of this committee have 
listened to patients. We have listened to providers. We have 
listened to payors. The Federal Government is one of the 
biggest payors in this effort and we are all about accelerating 
the discovery, development, and delivery of innovative drugs 
and medical devices. That was a lot of what was behind passage 
and implementation of 21st Century Cures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;We have heard from Dr. Gottlieb and we have heard from the 
head of NIH about the progress they are making already with the 
legislation we have enacted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Today, though, we want to get a more full appreciation for 
the drug supply chain, and I think you all would have to 
acknowledge its complexity, and we want to ask questions 
instead of jumping to conclusions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I encourage members on both sides of the aisle to dismiss, 
to a certain extent, any of your preconceived notions and let's 
focus on how each stage of the drug supply chain impacts 
access, delivery, and delivery of drugs and, of course, costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;We need to listen to the complex journey from molecular 
discoveries to patient deliveries that one dose of medicine 
takes along the way and we all need to learn about the impact 
each participant in the supply chain has in the ultimate cost 
to patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And we have no shortage of witnesses today to help us gain 
a better understanding, and we appreciate you all being here. 
We have representatives from the manufacturers, the 
distributors, the payers, the pharmacists, the providers, and 
the patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And I promise today's hearing will be an informative 
discussion and, I dare say, not the last as we move forward to 
better educate ourselves and then look at the public policy 
changes that need to be made to move America forward in these 
areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Greg Walden&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;So I thank you all for your participation. I think you'll 
find the committee is very interested in every step of this 
process and with that, Mr. Chairman, I would yield the balance 
of my time to the chairwoman of the Telecommunications 
Subcommittee, the gentlelady from Tennessee, Mrs. Blackburn.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Thank you, Dr. Burgess, for holding this important 
discussion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;As we all know, no one is immune to sickness and disease. 
This is, in part, why our committee--under the bipartisan 
leadership of former Chairman Fred Upton and Congresswoman 
Diana DeGette--championed the 21st Century Cures initiative.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;For more than 4 years, members of this committee listened 
to patients, providers, and payors. Accelerating the discovery, 
development, and delivery of innovative drugs became a 
nationwide mantra for the passage of Cures. And I'm proud to 
say that today--thanks to the tireless advocacy of patients 
across the country and the endurance of members of this 
committee--we celebrate the one-year anniversary of this 
landmark bill being signed into law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;But our work isn't done. As Dr. Burgess has said, ``As we 
continue to build on the success of the transformative 21st 
Century Cures act, our committee must fully comprehend how each 
step of the drug supply chain process impacts consumers.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;He's right. And it is why we are here today--to learn from 
patient and industry experts and improve our understanding of 
the drug supply chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;In order to fully appreciate the drug supply chain you have 
to acknowledge its complexity and ask questions instead of 
jumping to conclusions. I encourage members on both sides of 
the aisle to dismiss any preconceived notions and focus on how 
each stage of the drug supply chain impacts access and delivery 
of drugs. Listen to the complex journey--from molecular 
discoveries to patient deliveries--that one dose of medicine 
takes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Now, I'll be up front: For me, this isn't a drug pricing 
hearing. There's enough rhetoric about the cost of drugs. But 
having said that I know that I have more to learn about the 
impact each participant in the supply chain has in the ultimate 
cost to patients. And we have no shortage of witnesses to 
question As you can see, we have invited witnesses from each 
step of the process: manufacturers, distributers, payors, 
pharmacists, providers, and patients. I promise today's hearing 
will be an informative discussion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;On that note, I'd like to welcome to each of our expert 
panelists. I appreciate your generosity and willingness to 
participate today. And I yield to Mrs. Blackburn of Tennessee, 
who would like to offer a few opening remarks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank 
Chairman Burgess for the hearing and to each of you. We know it 
is the busy time of year. We are appreciative that you are here 
before us and, as Chairman Burgess said, we have the entire 
panoply of the system.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;And most of my constituents will tell you they understand 
how their doctor, their insurance plan, and the pharmacy play 
into the prescriptions they receive. They do not have the 
understanding, as Chairman Walden said, of the complex system 
that goes from research to the time they pick up that 
prescription, and we are so interested in looking at this 
access, delivery, and cost issue within this entire spectrum.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;It does affect health care delivery, and being from middle 
Tennessee, we have a lot of health care in my congressional 
district and this entire supply chain is an issue that we 
discuss often.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;And we are excited about some of the new innovations that 
are coming your way with technology. So that will enter into 
our discussion today. Thank you for your presence and, Mr. 
Chairman, I will yield back to you the balance of the time and 
if there is another member who would like to claim that time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;    Yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Seeing none, the gentlelady yields back. The
chair thanks the gentlelady.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR., A REPRESENTATIVEIN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. FRANK PALLONE"&gt;    The chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, the 
ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, 5 minutes 
for an opening statement, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;This committee has spent considerable time examining the 
drug supply chain both through the Drug Quality Security Act 
and, more recently, through the 21st Century Cures, and today 
is actually the 1-year anniversary of when President Obama 
signed 21st Century Cures. Both of these legislative efforts 
were the result of considerable oversight and discussion as to 
how the drug supply chain worked, how it could be better 
secured and how we could encourage efficiencies to improve drug 
development. And these bipartisan efforts have helped to 
address the post-market security of products and the regulatory 
review process. But neither effort focused on how prescription 
drugs move through the supply chain through the financial lens.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Prescription drug prices are higher than ever, and while 
the dramatic rise in prescription spending has come down a 
little, we know addressing drug costs continues to be a top 
priority for many American families. The costs of prescriptions 
have forced so many American families to make tough choices. 
For some, it is a choice of filling their prescriptions or 
filling their tank of gas to get to work. For others, they are 
leaving prescriptions unfulfilled, skipping doses, or cutting 
pill in half so they don't have to purchase their prescriptions 
that often, and none of these choices is acceptable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Today, prescription drug spending represents about 14 
percent of overall health care spending. It is no wonder that 
six in 10 Americans have said that lowering prescription drug 
costs should be a top priority for Congress and this 
administration and I am pleased that there has been such 
bipartisan interest in this topic both during consideration of 
the FDA Reauthorization Act and at recent member briefings, and 
I do believe that making prescription drugs more affordable for 
the average consumer is an issue that we all care about and can 
support.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And that is why today's hearing is so important. This 
morning, we have the opportunity to better understand the drug 
supply chain and the often-complicated ways that drugs move 
through the supply chain to the patient. As my colleagues have 
pointed out, we will hear from each of our witnesses about the 
role they play regarding drug delivery, the impact they have on 
the cost of drugs, and the value they bring to patients and 
consumers, and I hope and expect that today's hearing will 
serve as a foundation for future hearings on policy solutions 
that may help reduce prescription drug costs in our health care 
system.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;While understanding how the supply chain works is 
critically important to this committee, I also would urge 
Chairman Walden to schedule a legislative hearing in the early 
part of next year to examine specific proposals to address the 
high prices of prescription drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Our constituents want and expect us to take concrete action 
to address this growing problem. And the problems we are seeing 
in the supply chain cannot be addressed through one policy 
solution and all of our witnesses have a role to play in these 
solutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;It is long past time for Congress to take a serious look at 
all solutions that will help American families to afford the 
medications they depend on and I look forward to further 
bipartisan discussion on what that broad range of policy 
solutions may look like.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;And I want to thank each of our witnesses for being here 
and look forward to learning more about your role in the drug 
supply chain and how we can improve access to drugs for 
patients in the future, and I would like to yield the remainder 
of my time to Congressman Lujan from New Mexico.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;    Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lujan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Pallone, and Mr. Chairman, thank
you for this important hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;There is so much going on in the health care arena right 
now--CHIP, community health centers, National Health Services 
Corps, special diabetes program, Medicare extenders, Puerto 
Rico's Medicaid program--items that all need attention and need 
it now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;With all these priorities competing for attention, it would 
be easy to lose sight of which should be our guiding star--
finding ways to balance innovation and affordability.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;We depend on different approaches to give us more time with 
the ones we love, whether it is a brother who lives with 
diabetes or a mother with a new cancer diagnosis. Our lives 
have been improved by many tools including pharmaceutical 
therapies. To realize the promise of these innovations, we must 
ensure patients can access the cures that manufacturers spend 
so much energy and effort developing. It doesn't help to hold 
out hope for a cure if there is no hope that regular people can 
afford it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;It is unrealistic to think the answer to making 
prescription drugs affordable for everyone is ending the 340B 
program or allowing for off-label communication.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;We must all look holistically at what affordable accessible 
health care means. I am also real interested, Mr. Chairman--on 
a bit of a sidebar here--because we have everyone in the room 
to work with you and make sure that we are pushing pain 
management treatments that are nonaddictive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;This is critically important. We have a huge problem facing 
our country and we need to work together to get that done. We 
also need serious treatments from everyone here to make sure 
that we are addressing the cravings that come from opioids and 
alcohol.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;Simply having medications that make someone sick if they 
use is not going to stop the craving and not going to stop use.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;I am hopeful this is the first of many hearings examining 
how we ensure affordable accessible prescription drugs and I 
look forward to working with everyone here on real solutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentleman. Gentleman yields

would remind members that pursuant to committee rules, all 
members' opening statements will be made part of the record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And once again, we do want to thank our witnesses for being 
here today, taking time to testify before the subcommittee. 
Each witness is going to have an opportunity to give a three-

from members.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

President for Policy and Research at PhRMA and it is my 
pleasure to be here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Over the past 20 years, more than 500 new medicines have 
been approved to come to market to treat some our nation's most 
challenging and costly conditions. In the midst of this 
progress, prescription drug medicine growth is growing slowly. 
Just last week, CMS released new data to show that prescription 
drug spending in 2016 grew at 1.3 percent. That was lower than 
any other category of spending. To put that into context, 
hospital spending growth grew at three and a half times that 
amount. In the last 7 out of 10 years, prescription drug 
spending growth has been below national spending growth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Today, medicines consume about 14 percent of the health 
care dollar, and many assume, when they see that number, that 
all, or substantially all, of that flows back to the brand name 
manufacturers. However, less than half of that, or 47 percent, 
is attributable to brand name drug spending. The remainder, 23 
percent, goes to generic firms and 31 percent goes to the 
supply chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Going forward over the next decade, medicines are projected 
to remain 14 percent of the health care dollar, and many 
question how is that possible knowing all of the new 
innovations that are coming to market in the coming years. And 
there are a few reasons for that, the first being that over 
$100 billion worth of medicines will be going off-patent over 
the next five years and that will put cost pressure as new 
generics and biosimilars enter the marketplace. The second is 
the fact that there is significant cost constraint in the 
prescription drug market as three large pharmacy benefit 
managers buy on behalf of over 70 percent of all prescriptions 
in this country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;These PBMs exert significant cost pressure to keep prices 
and spending in check. One of the ways they do that is by 
extracting significant discounts and rebates from 
pharmaceutical manufacturers. In fact, discounters and rebates 
increased 40 percent over the last 4 years and now total over 
$100 billion a year. Unfortunately, oftentimes those discounts 
and rebates are captured by intermediaries and don't make their 
way back to patients. This problem has become more acute over 
time as we've seen a dramatic increase in the number of 
patients that today have a deductible for their medicine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;So take, for example, a patient who takes an insulin 
product with a list price of $400 and that medicine carries a 
discount of about 65 percent. A patient with a deductible today 
goes to the pharmacy counter and will be asked to pay $400 for 
that medicine despite the fact that the insurance company is 
paying nothing while earning $239 on every sale. Given the 
rapid rise in deductibles, this must change. Insurance 
companies and PBMs must be pushing these discounts and rebates 
back to patients to lower their out-of-pocket spending.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF TOM DILENGE&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="TOM DILENGE"&gt;    The chair recognizes Mr. DiLenge for 3 minutes for your 
opening statement, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Green,
Mr. Walden, Ranking Member Pallone. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today about how to sustain the 
biomedical innovation that is bringing home and cures to the 
patients who need them the most.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;I am Tom DiLenge. I am Vice President for Advocacy, Law, 
and Public Policy. While BIO represents the entire biomedical 
ecosystem--universities, startups, investors, large drug 
companies--the vast majority of our members--about 80 percent--
are small companies with no marketed products and no profits. 
They rely heavily on outside investors and partners to fund the 
cutting-edge research that they do, and it is these small 
companies that are leading 70 percent of the nearly 6,000 
clinical trials that are underway today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;Another key fact--almost 60 percent of all new medicines 
are innovated right here in America, more than the rest of the 
world combined. We lead because America has a public policy 
environment that incentivizes the investment and innovation and 
this committee, on a bipartisan basis, has led the way on that 
for decades. This is critical because, while NIH funds really 
important research, it is the private sector that spends $150 
billion every year in applied R&amp;amp;D to bring products from 
research to the marketplace.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;This investment provides more than 1.7 million American 
jobs and we are growing jobs at twice the rate of the national 
average. More importantly, we are having an awe-inspiring 
record of public health accomplishment, transforming HIV/AIDS 
from a death sentence to a manageable condition, increasing 
cancer survival in children to 83 percent today, and hundreds 
of other new medicines for once-debilitating diseases.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;We are saving millions of lives. We are saving trillions of 
dollars in the process. We are making discoveries that were 
once unimaginable--immuno-oncology, in which we activate the 
body's own immune system to attack cancer--gene therapy, which 
we can repair defective genes or use the patient's own cells to 
make a medicine tailored for that patient.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;Precision and personalized medicine is here. Thus, to 
understand the pricing dynamics of our market, it is important 
to consider a couple of facts. Ninety percent of clinical 
programs fail. Ninety-two percent of our companies are 
unprofitable. Ten to 15 years and $2.6 billion, the average 
time and cost to bring a medicine through approval, that number 
has doubled since 2003, and nearly 90 percent of prescriptions 
today in America are for cheap generic copies of once-branded 
drugs. Thus, it is the revenues from the 10 percent of 
successful clinical programs that have to be sufficient to 
incentivize this entire wonderful innovation ecosystem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;We have repeatedly seen biotech investment jeopardized by 
the spectre of government price setting. The small companies 
are the proverbial canaries in the coal mine when it comes to 
that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;We also recognize that patients, even those with insurance, 
cannot afford many of these lifesaving miracles. We share this 
commitment to solving the problem. BIO has joined the coalition 
with a lot of people at the table and others--insurers, PBMs, 
patient groups--to come up with market-based ways to lower drug 
costs. We'd love to work with this committee on doing that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;Reward volume, reward value, not volume, inject more 
competition, empower patients. So with Congress' continued 
support, we are going to put more Americans to work, we are 
going to lower health care costs, and we are going to heal the 
world in the process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF CHIP DAVIS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="CHIP DAVIS"&gt;    Mr. Davis, you're recognized for 3 minutes for an opening 
statement, please. And your microphone.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Sorry about that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Good morning, Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, 
Chairman Walden, and Ranking Member Pallone, members of the 
subcommittee. Thank you for the invitation and opportunity to 
testify today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;As stated, my name is Chip Davis. I am the President and 
CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines. We are the 
leading trade association for manufacturers of FDA-approved 
generic and biosimilar medicines. Our members manufacture more 
than 61 billion doses of medication at over 150 facilities here 
in the United States on an annual basis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;As you know, Americans across the political spectrum are 
calling for action to lower the cost of prescription drugs, 
making it a foremost health priority, which is why we are all 
here today. Despite a lot of well-intentioned rhetoric, over 
the last year the problem of high drug prices by and large 
continues unabated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Last month, the nominee for secretary of health and human 
services, Alex Azar, said that drug prices are too high and 
must be lowered. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb recently 
characterized drug costs as a public health concern.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Congress now has the opportunity to take meaningful action 
to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Over 30 years ago, 
through Hatch-Waxman, Congress sought to strike a careful 
balance between encouraging innovation in drug development, 
which we all support, and accelerating access to lower cost 
generic alternatives for patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Unfortunately, the patient access side of Hatch-Waxman is 
absolutely unequivocally in jeopardy as we speak. This is due 
to a combination of factors, including a failure of policy to 
keep pace with a changing pharmaceutical market, a growing 
market and balance between generic buyers and sellers, and an 
increase in anti-competitive business practices deployed by 
certain brand companies who have been increasing these 
activities so much in recent years that recently Commissioner 
Gottlieb counseled the industry last month, and I am quoting, 
``to end the shenanigans,'' during his formal remarks at an FTC 
hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;The generic industry operates in a rapidly changing often-
commoditized marketplace with significant and unique pressures 
that distinguish it from the monopolized brands sector. As a 
result, generics continue to experience accelerated price 
deflation. In fact, it is ironic in many ways that at a time 
when the overall costs of prescription drugs is such a high 
profile issue that generic medicines are currently experiencing 
an unprecedented degree of price deflation, which impacts the 
national health estimate figures that were mentioned 
previously. In fact, according to IQVIA, which is formerly 
Quintiles IMS, for 16 consecutive months generic drugs prices 
have declined.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Our members operate in a consolidated market where three 
large buying consortiums of wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
now control 90 percent of the retail generic market. Portfolio 
decisions related to what medicines they will continue to 
manufacture, announcing pending closures of manufacturing 
facilities, and significant anticipated job layoffs in the 
generic sector are all things that we are currently 
experiencing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Should the market not evolve itself and should Congress 
fail to take action, these trends will continue, threatening 
uninterrupted patient access to the needed generic medicines. 
When generics and biosimilars are available, competition 
increases and patients benefit from access to safe and 
affordable treatment options.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;We have provided this committee with recommendations that 
Congress could take today to increase competition and increase 
patient access.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;I thank you again for the opportunity to testify and look 
forward to your questions today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH GALLENAGH&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ELIZABETH GALLENAGH"&gt;    Ms. Gallenagh, you're recognized for 3 minutes, please, to 
summarize your opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;Good morning, Chairman Burgess, Ranking
Member Green, Chairman Walden, and Ranking Member Pallone and 
members of the subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;Thank you for the chance to participate in today's hearing. 
Health Care Distribution Alliance represents 35 primary 
pharmaceutical distributors, the vital link between the 
nation's pharmaceutical manufacturers and more than 200,000 
pharmacies, hospitals, and other providers nationwide. Their 
expertise streamlines the supply chain to ensure safety and 
efficiency while achieving cost savings for our nation's health 
care system.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;Without HDA members, pharmacies and providers would have to 
carry weeks of inventory and undertake the time consuming 
process of placing daily individual orders with every 
manufacturer. By working with full line distributors, 
pharmacies can maintain just-in-time inventories, saving them 
the expense and staff necessary to carry extensive inventories 
or manage large storage facilities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;While our members are logistics experts, pharmaceutical 
distribution has evolved over the last decade. This is no 
longer an industry focused solely on moving products from point 
A to point B. In exchange for a variety of distribution and 
logistics services that primary distributors provide to 
manufacturers, they charge bona fide service fees. These fees, 
which are not passed on to the customer, represent a fair 
market value for itemized services actually performed on behalf 
of the manufacturer that the manufacturer would have to perform 
otherwise for themselves.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;Our industry is a very high volume yet low profit margin 
industry with the industry margin just over 1 percent on 
average in 2016. Moreover, in a recent 2017 study, the Berkeley 
Research Group concluded the pharmaceutical wholesale 
distributor profit on overall branded drug costs was just under 
1 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;Traditional pharmaceutical wholesale distributors purchase 
pharmaceuticals from manufacturers based on the wholesale 
acquisition cost, or WAC--a publicly available figure reported 
for each product by the manufacturer. WAC represents the 
manufacturer's list price and does not include rebates, prompt 
payment, or other adjustments in price resulting from 
downstream or proprietary negotiation. Manufacturers set the 
WAC prices for their products and distributors are not privy to 
how that pricing decisions are made.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;Primary distributors typically sell branded drugs to 
downstream customers based on those WACs established solely by 
those manufacturers. Distributors might also sell generic drugs 
to downstream customers based on WACs or they may be based in 
part on response to the market, which includes competing 
generic drugs. In other words, wholesale distributors do not 
control the price of pharmaceuticals, but rather the price of 
pharmaceuticals is dictated by list prices determined by their 
manufacturers and other market forces including the WACs of 
generic drugs that compete with given generic drug products.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;HDA distributor members add value within the supply chain 
and have minimal impact on the overall cost of drugs. 
Ultimately, the services provided by our members result in 
benefits to patients and consumers and have made the U.S. 
pharmaceutical supply chain one of the safest and most 
efficient in the world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MARK MERRITT&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MARK MERRITT"&gt;    The chair recognizes Mr. Merritt for 3 minutes. Summarize 
your opening statement, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the
committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Pharmacy benefit managers are the industry that employers 
and others hire to negotiate discounts and reduce prescription 
drug costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;We see too many reasons why drug pricing has become a focal 
point in recent years. First, as drug makers shift from making 
blockbuster drugs like Lipitor, which cost maybe $3 a day, to 
making much more expensive products like Sovaldi--a great 
product, but it costs $1,000 a day. Second, in the face of 
rising medical costs, more health plans are raising deductibles 
in order to keep premiums as low as possible. This means for 
the first time some patients who had grown accustomed to paying 
$2,500 for a $500 drug are now seeing how expensive some of 
these drugs really are.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;It's important to note that while the subject of today's 
hearing--the drug supply chain--is important and worthy to be 
discussed, it has nothing to do with why drug companies raise 
prices. As always, pricing power and pricing decisions in any 
industry are driven by supply and demand and competition, not 
supply chains.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Prices are set exclusively by drug companies with zero 
input from anybody else in the supply chain including PBMs. 
Further, supply chains are a routine part of how consumers 
access products in the marketplace today. Every industry uses 
them. They are not unique to health care or prescription drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;In the simplest terms, the prescription drug marketplace is 
like any other--a market of sellers and buyers. Drug makers are 
the sellers and, like all sellers, set prices according to 
whatever they think the market will bear. Likewise, buyers, who 
we represent, want to pay as little as possible. These are the 
employers, unions, health plans, and government programs that 
hire PBMs to negotiate rebates, discounts, and other price 
concessions from drug makers and drug stores. These savings are 
used to reduce premiums, cost sharing, and other expenses. And 
some drug makers have tried to blame their own pricing 
decisions on the supply chain but this makes little sense. For 
example, Mylan used this excuse when they raised EpiPen prices 
400 percent at a time when supply chain costs were relatively 
flat. Sovaldi had a launch price of $84,000 even though it 
involved no rebates at all.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Some of the highest prices are in Medicare Part B, as in 
boy, where payments are set by the Federal Government without 
negotiations from PBMs or rebates. In any case, almost half of 
the RFPs large employers use when hiring PBMs now require PBMs 
to pass through 100 percent of the rebates and about 90 percent 
of rebates are passed through overall in the marketplace.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;While PBMs are proud that, according to CMS, drug trend 
only grew 1 percent last year despite rising list prices, we 
welcome manufacturers to offer alternatives to rebates as a way 
to get discounts. Payers--our clients--just want the lowest net 
cost wherever they can get them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MATT EYLES&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MATT EYLES"&gt;    Mr. Eyles, you are recognized for 3 minutes to summarize 
your opening statement, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the
subcommittee. I am Matt Eyles, Chief Operating Officer of 
America's Health Insurance Plans, the national association 
whose members provide coverage for health care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;I appreciate the opportunity to testify on behalf of our 
members this morning and my testimony focuses really on three 
topics. First, the consequences of out of control drug prices, 
both excessive launch prices and supersized price increases, 
and the impact they have on consumers and the factors pointing 
to a broken pharmaceutical market. Second, any discussion of 
drug prices and the supply chain must begin with the list 
price, set solely by drugs companies, and which act as the 
starting point for plans and PBMs to negotiate lower prices for 
consumers. Third, AHIP's policy solutions to promote more 
affordable drug prices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;Out of control prices are the result of drug companies 
taking advantage of a market skewed in their favor. Too often, 
this skewed market has granted economic power to drug companies 
through price-dictating monopolies. For example, with no 
generic competitors, the list price of popular insulin 
increased almost 300 percent since 2007, while the CPI rose 
only about 15 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;If you remember one message this morning, it is that the 
entire pricing process is driven off the list price of a 
branded drug, solely determined by the drug company, not anyone 
else, and the end result is everyone pays more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;AHIP's members negotiate with providers and drug 
manufacturers to cover high-quality treatments and services at 
the most affordable prices. Looking at the drug supply chain, 
we must keep two points in mind. First, health insurers offer 
comprehensive coverage under the pharmacy benefit for 
prescriptions delivered through retail pharmacies. This 
represents about 70 percent of drug spending. Second, plans 
provide coverage under the medical benefit for physician-
administered drugs delivered in outpatient and inpatient 
settings. This covers about 30 percent of spending.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;Our discussion today focuses largely on that first bucket 
covered under the pharmacy benefit but plans provide coverage 
for both types and therefore have a unique perspective into the 
broader drug market. A 2017 AHIP analysis found that 22 cents 
of every dollar spent on insurance premiums goes toward 
prescription drugs. This is a conservative estimate by 
excluding hospital spending on drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;But here's the bottom line.: The 22 percent outpaces 
spending on physicians, inpatient hospital, and outpatient 
hospital services. So when drug prices go up, insurance 
premiums go up, and that's an economic reality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;For the committee's consideration, we included 
recommendations in our written statement with three categories 
of policy solutions--first, delivering real competition through 
generics and biosimilars; second, ensuring open and honest 
pricing with greater transparency into how drug prices are set 
and when prices increase excessively; and third, delivering 
value to patients by expanding efforts to link drug prices to 
clinical value and outcomes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;Thank you very much--our 5,000 hospital and
health system members. I would like to briefly address three 
issues: the drug supply chain, drug pricing, and the 340B 
program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;America's hospitals rely on innovative drug therapies to 
save lives every day. Modern pharmaceuticals play a critical 
role in getting patients healthy and helping them maintain that 
health.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;The drug supply chain is, as Chairman Walden said, complex, 
with the number of steps between the development and delivery 
of a drug. Hospitals primarily intersect with the drug supply 
chain in their role as purchasers and dispensers of 
pharmaceuticals. At the beginning of the chain, our academic 
medical center members play a leading role in both the 
development and testing of new drug therapies. Studies show 
that these efforts discover drugs that have a 
disproportionately important clinical effect in therapies that 
can be used for widespread public health concerns. Further down 
the supply chain all hospitals are major purchasers of drugs 
used in clinical settings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;Hospitals work with manufacturers and group purchasing 
organizations to negotiate the best prices for the drugs they 
use and reduce administrative expenses. Most hospitals do 
retain some direct contracting with drug manufacturers 
primarily for branded therapies for which there is no 
competition. Once a hospital acquires a drug, it manages its 
supply in hospital-based pharmacies who work with prescribing 
clinicians to develop and manage the formulary, following 
standards that take into account evidence-based clinical, 
ethical, legal, and other factors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;Pharmacists also manage the dispensing of medications to 
the appropriate clinical staff who then deliver the drug to the 
patient. In terms of pricing, spending on pharmaceuticals, as 
has been noted, has increased dramatically over the last 
several years and the primary driver is higher prices. We see 
both higher launch prices for new drugs and increases in prices 
for existing drugs. Limited competition and drug shortages have 
also facilitated this growth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;Whether GPO or a hospital is negotiating, the starting 
price, as has been pointed out, is the price set by the 
manufacturer. The ability of the GPO or hospital to obtain a 
discount off the price largely has to do with volume and 
whether and how much competition exists. In instances where no 
competition exists such as for many of the new high-cost 
specialty drugs, large discounts are not available.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;The burden of these high prices falls on all purchasers 
including patients and the providers who treat them. For 
example, hospitals frequently see patients show up in the 
emergency department or return for follow-up care sicker than 
when they left because they were unable to afford their drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;Hospitals as drug purchasers also face significant resource 
constraints as spending on drugs increase. Hospitals must make 
tradeoffs between investments in staff, technology, and 
facilities upgrade and paying more for drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;Lastly, I want to mention the 340B program which permits 
safety net hospitals to care for communities with a high number 
of low-income and uninsured to stretch scarce federal resources 
as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients and 
providing more comprehensive services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;The 340B program enables these hospitals to serve their 
communities by reinvesting savings from reduced drug prices 
into programs that benefit vulnerable patients at no additional 
cost.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF GERALD HARMON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;Dr. Harmon, you're recognized for 3 minutes to summarize 
your opening statement, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;Dr. Harmon. Thank you, Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member 
Green, distinguished members of the subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;I am Gerry Harmon. I am a practising family physician from 
Parleys Island, South Carolina, and Chairman of the AMA Board 
of Trustees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;I think we can all agree that our goal is to ensure 
patients have access to the right medication at the right time. 
I want to speak to the physician's role of prescribing the most 
appropriate treatment and the challenges my patients and I 
face.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;Affordability in price can indeed be a major barrier, but 
so are the various administrative hoops that we have to jump 
through when prescribing medications. Such hoops includes 
things such as prior authorizations, frequently changing drug 
formularies, step therapy, nonstandardized forms, all put in 
place by insurance companies in an attempt to manage costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;These barriers usually delay treatment for my patients and, 
clearly, take time away from patient care. As an example, in 
the few days I've been away from my practice on a trip such as 
today, I received an email from a long-time patient who has 
recently changed his insurance coverage. His blood pressure 
medicine that he's been stable on for years now is not on the 
new formulary under his new plan and he's down to his last 30 
days of therapy. I am going to have to call his pharmacy 
benefit managers--PBM, request a form and a fax number, fill 
out the form with some data points and fax it back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;Eventually, I hope to get some ideas from the insurance 
company and/or the PBM about what types of different 
medications I might consider or steps I might follow in order 
to prescribe my patient's medicine. I cannot do this in a 
standard form or electronically via email. My patient, 
meanwhile, is at risk for running out of medications or 
changing to a less effective therapy. Clearly, that's going to 
endanger his health. He could end up going to the emergency 
room or having a serious illness such as a heart attack or a 
stroke, which adds enormous cost to the entire health care 
system.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;Such efforts to maintain cost and value in such an 
otherwise stable patient are, clearly, misdirected. In another 
venue, doctors who administer biologic medications to treat 
certain cancer, rheumatoid arthritis patients face even more 
costs and challenges than a primary care doctor like myself.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;Small community practices in particular are at a 
disadvantage relative to hospitals and large practices when it 
comes to requiring biological medications for special patients. 
Patients usually have to pay a high co-pay for medicine. We've 
alluded to that in other testimony. It could cost tens of 
thousands of dollars and the co-pay can be as high as 20 or 30 
percent, and that's a bunch of money to my patient population.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;When the patients cannot afford the co-pay, the physicians, 
who must pay for the medicines up front, cannot manage the 
debt, and the patients are referred to treated in the hospitals 
or outpatient settings that are much more expensive. And these 
are just some of the challenges doctors face when helping 
patients navigate medicines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;What could help physicians like myself? We've offered some 
opportunities for improvement in our written testimony. There 
are so many opportunities. We can discuss them almost ad 
infinitum.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="GERALD HARMON"&gt;In closing, I would like to thank you. AMA looks forward to 
working with you on this issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF B. DOUGLAS HOEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="B. DOUGLAS HOEY"&gt;    Mr. Hoey, you're recognized for 3 minutes, please, to 
summarize your opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess, and Ranking Member
Green and members of the subcommittee for conducting this 
hearing and for the invitation to testify.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;I am Douglas Hoey, CEO of the National Community 
Pharmacists Association. NCPA represents America's community 
pharmacists including the owners of 22,000 independent 
community pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;More than any industry segment, independent pharmacists are 
in underserved rural and urban areas. Local pharmacists are the 
medication experts on the health care team and, importantly, to 
consumers nationwide. These health care professionals are 
easily accessible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;Pharmacists increase health care quality and decrease its 
costs by optimizing safe and effective medication use. Over the 
past few years, CMS has been testing new payment and care 
models across hundreds of community pharmacists and to date, 
nearly 300,000 patients have been enrolled. Early findings 
suggest high patient satisfaction, improved outcomes, and 
reduced overall health care spending with reductions of greater 
than $1000 a year for those patients who received high clinical 
intervention. To achieve that future promise, however, systemic 
barriers must be overcome. We believe intermediary parties, 
pharmacy benefit manager middlemen, are increasing pricing 
complexity and contributing to higher prescription drug costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;Since their inception, PBMs have morphed from claims 
adjudicators into little known and largely unregulated 
corporations, and despite their immense market influence, PBMs 
are not subject to industry-wide regulation nor do they have an 
obligation to always put their clients' interests above their 
own. Opaque PBM practices that require increased transparency 
including PBM-retained rebates and spread pricing, generic drug 
reimbursement schemes and pharmacy direct and indirect 
remuneration, or DIR, fees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;And I will expand on our members' current number-one 
concern, which are DIR fees. Now, these fees are assessed on 
pharmacies months after a prescription is filled. CMS has 
identified concerns from the rapid growth in DIR fees including 
higher beneficiary costs, accelerating patients into the donut 
hole, and the shifting of liability for Part B costs from plan 
sponsors to CMS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;In the recently released Medicare proposed rule, CMS 
explicitly states they are considering requiring all price 
concessions from pharmacies to be reflected at the point of 
sale.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;NCPA strongly supports this approach. CMS estimates this 
would result in significant patient savings at the pharmacy 
counter, as well as overall savings over a 10-year period.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;In conclusion, it makes financial sense for Congress to 
demand increased true transparency into the prescription drug 
marketplace for all taxpayer-funded prescription drugs, and to 
fully utilize the expertise of the community pharmacist to 
identify potential savings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF DAVID MITCHELL&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DAVID MITCHELL"&gt;    Mr. Guthrie [presiding]. Thank you. The gentleman's time 
has expired and I recognize Mr. Mitchell for 3 minutes for your 
opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, Chairman Walden, 
members of the committee, I am honored to be here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;I am David Mitchell and I am founder of Patients for 
Affordable Drugs. We are bipartisan. We focus on policies to 
lower prescription drug prices. We don't accept funding from 
any organizations that profit from the development or 
distribution of prescription drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;More importantly for today, I have an incurable blood 
cancer called multiple myeloma and prescription drugs are 
keeping me alive, literally. Right now, my treatment is 5 hours 
of infusions, carry a price tag of $450,000 this year. I am 
very grateful to the science and research communities for these 
drugs, and because my disease is incurable, it finds its way 
around drugs. It mutates. I need innovation of new drugs if I 
am going to stay alive. This is not theoretical for me. It's 
literally life and death.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;But my experience has taught me one irrefutable fact, and 
that is that drugs don't work if people can't afford them. 
Since our launch in February, we've built a community of almost 
20,000 Americans from every state. Patients tell us terrible 
stories of skipping doses, cutting pills in half, even 
declaring bankruptcy, because of the price of their drugs. 
They're scared, they're angry, and they need help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;I am going to highlight a few policy solutions for the drug 
supply chain. First, however, it is critical to note that 
prices set by drug corporations with government-granted 
monopolies are at the headwaters of the pricing problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;When retail prices set by drug corporations go up, all the 
players in the system make more money--drug manufacturer, PBMs, 
doctors, hospitals. The people hurt are patients, consumers, 
taxpayers, and employers who foot the bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;But the drug supply chain downstream is also a big part of 
the problem. Here's a patient perspective on some elements. 
One, we should allow Medicare to directly negotiate lower 
prices for patients. Every other developed country in the world 
does this. We should, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;We need increased transparency throughout the supply chain. 
Three pharmacy benefit managers control almost 80 percent of 
the market and negotiate in secret, leaving consumers, 
taxpayers, and policymakers in the dark.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Co-pay coupons and patient assistant programs are phony 
charities. They are designed to do one thing. That is keep 
prices high. They are not charity. They are marketing. 
According to City Research, for every $1 million spent on 
charitable donations, drug corporations reap as much as $21 
million in return. We should lower drug prices and make co-pay 
coupons unnecessary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Finally, we have to ensure that patients pay based on 
rebated, not list, prices and that patients with insurance 
don't pay more than they would if they paid cash.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Gag clauses should be outlawed. I am extremely encouraged 
that members on both sides of the aisle are here today focusing 
on drug pricing because, in my experience, the most enduring 
legislative solutions have come with bipartisan action.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Mitchell, and I want to thank
the entire panel for their testimony and we will move into the 
question/answer portion of the hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    We'd like to recognize the gentleman from Oregon, Mr. 
Walden, chairman of the full committee, 5 minutes for 
questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I want to thank the chairman very much and,
again, I want to thank all the witnesses today. You have helped 
us scratch the surface, get a better understanding from the 
start to the finish--from the molecular development to the 
patient who's on a lifesaving drug.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And, obviously, you have also outlined for us differences 
of opinion about how we achieve more affordable health care and 
not just--we are looking at this, by the way, not just at the 
drug chain but across the entire industry of health care. And 
it is a big one, it is an expensive one, and I know when I go 
home to Oregon it is on top of everybody's minds. They may 
complain about their insurance premium or this, that, or the 
other thing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;But at the end of the day, they all want to know why--you 
name it in health care--why it costs what it does or they want 
to know what it costs, because of lack of transparency. You 
don't even know. There are all these schemes and things and I 
think we are all trying to get to the bottom of it and my goal 
is to have an informed process, beginning today, that lets you 
all make your case.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And I would just be curious, as you all have heard each 
other talk, and we finished with Mr. Mitchell, who I've met 
with before in my office, and sorry for what you're going 
through, obviously, but you make a very compelling case.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    You make some pretty strong statements about what needs to 
be changed and I would like to go to the other end because some 
of those are targeted at the pharmaceutical companies and see 
if we can get a response from Ms. Reilly on what Mr. Mitchell 
said and how we should be guided in this, and if others want to 
weigh in along the way that would be good as well.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Well, thank you for the question, and I think a
lot of what I heard out of David's mouth are things that we do 
agree with.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;For example, today, as I talked about and others talked 
about, our companies do provide robust discounts and rebates to 
pharmacy benefit managers and insurers, and unlike almost any 
other part of the health care system, those rebates and 
discounts aren't passed back to the patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;If a patient with a deductible today ends up in the 
hospital before they reach their deductible, the price they pay 
is a negotiated price that that insurance company has 
negotiated on their behalf. It seems strange that if a patient 
instead needs a pharmaceutical before they reach their 
deductible, that they're asked to pay a full unnegotiated price 
for the medicine and don't get the benefit of that discount and 
actually earn money on every transaction. That doesn't seem 
right to me and I think that does need to change.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    CMS just, earlier this year, posted their new Part D rule. 
In it, they put a request for information out about the 
potential for passing through discounts and rebates in the 
Medicare Part D program. We actually think that's a good first 
step. Today, the evidence suggests by CMS that PBMs prefer 
medicines with high list prices and high rebates because for 
those products they can use those rebate dollars to keep their 
premiums low and they also put people into catastrophic quicker 
and passing through----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Right. So I want to give them a chance to
respond to that because I assume they will want to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    So let's go to the insurance plans. You have heard what Ms. 
Reilly said about consumers paying the full freight here and 
not being covered by insurance and no negotiation. Is that 
accurate? Is there something we should do about that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;So thank you, Chairman Walden, for the
opportunity. What I would say is health plans negotiate on 
behalf of their members and consumers every single day across 
all parts of the supply chain, whether it be providers or drug 
manufacturers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;To put this into context, I think you probably heard some 
of the statistics thrown around that 90 percent of the 
prescriptions are generic that are filled in this country. So 
that means about 10 percent are filled through retail--that are 
brands. Not all of those brands offer rebates. There's a large 
number of brands that don't offer rebates. So really we are 
trying to focus on a much smaller problem when the bigger 
problem really comes back to the price.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;    Using Ms. Reilly's example earlier of insulin of $400 a 
vial, a decade ago that vial was only about $90. Right now, if 
prices of insulin increased only by the consumer price index 
rather than much, much higher rates, we'd only be paying about 
$100 per vial, all right, if you're just following inflation. 
We wouldn't be having this discussion about rebates----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Mr. Eyles [continuing]. If it didn't start with the price.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; So who can tell me why that insulin is the
price it is today?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;I would say, Chairman Walden, the net price of
insulins have not changed all that significantly. What has 
changed is the levels of discounts and rebates that are being 
demanded in part because it is an extremely competitive market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    As I mentioned before, insurance companies, PBMs, in the 
Part D program, for example, they like high list prices that 
come with high rebates because they can then use those rebates 
to keep their premiums low, attract patients to their health 
care plan. Unfortunately, what the problem is is they're not 
sharing those rebates and discounts back with patients as they 
do if a patient ends up in the hospital or uses a physician and 
that's what needs to change.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;All right. My time has expired. We didn't get
to the PBM's view of this. I hope we do, coming forward, 
because this is the debate. Because at home the constituents 
say why is insulin $400 when it used to be a hundred dollars or 
whatever the number is, And that's repeated time again, whether 
it is EpiPen or whatever. We can't answer that either because I 
am not sure there is a good answer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    So with that, Mr. Chairman, I've exhausted my time and I, 
again, appreciate your willingness to have this hearing and 
yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentleman. Gentleman does
yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, 5 
minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;A Harvard study found that there are more than three-
quarters of the public believe that name brand prescription 
drugs are too high and an issue primarily driven by price 
increases in the absence of additional competition. Biologics 
represent the majority of these high-priced drugs representing 
7 out of the 10 highest grossing pharmaceutical products in 
2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;A landmark 2014 Rand study also estimated that biosimilars 
could save as much as $40 billion through 2024 in the United 
States alone, and we have another study from IMS Health opening 
markets to biosimilar competition health care systems could 
realize savings of more than 10 billion euros in the E.U. alone 
between 2016 and 2020. The cumulative savings over the next 5 
years in the E.U. and the United States would be 49 billion in 
euros.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;    Mr. Davis, Mr. Merritt, do you agree that we should support 
policies to encourage a workable pathway for biosimilars as we 
in Congress do encourage bringing these product online and 
encouraging uptake by physicians and plans for their patients? 
Mr. Davis first.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Congressman, thank you for your question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;The short answer is yes, we represent biosimilar 
manufacturers today in addition to generic manufacturers, and 
as you stated, biosimilars hold the potential for so much 
promise in terms of increasing access and realizing savings 
because they will provide competition to the increasingly 
costly degree of specialized medicine and personalized medicine 
moving forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;There's a couple challenges with respect to making sure 
that we realize the full potential of biosimilars here in the 
U.S. market. One is getting them to market, which is why we 
need to create some Fast Generics Act pass so that our members 
can actually gain access to the samples to do the 
pharmacovigilance to apply to the FDA to get biosimilars to the 
market. And then the second thing we have to look at, and we 
have to be candid about this, is right now there are eight 
biosimilars that have been approved by the FDA. There are only 
three on the market. The other five are tied up in endless 
litigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;So if we ultimately want to--we have a lot of catching up 
to do in terms of you mentioned the E.U. They are light years 
ahead of us in terms of utilization, access, and savings on 
biosimilars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    We have the opportunity from a policy perspective to catch 
up. The Federal Government started scoring savings for 
biosimilars in 2014 fiscal year. The first one wasn't on the 
market until September of 2015. So we have more work to do 
there.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt; Mr. Merritt.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;And I would agree with what Chip said.
Biologics are the future. Specialty products are the future and 
they're very expensive. They're very great products, as David 
Mitchell mentioned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;But right now, they're often unaffordable and the key is 
competition. Biologics already have 12 years of exclusivity. 
We'd like that to be down to seven so we can get competition 
started faster.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    We'd like these drugs to have the same name the way 
generics do with brand drugs on the regular market and a host 
of other things because without competition, you're not going 
to have savings and if you have more and more brand protection 
for every little minute change you make and if litigation ties 
these up for years and years, for a month, a couple of months, 
a year of being tied up in litigation can cost consumers 
billions of dollars. And so we are very aligned with the 
generics on this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I believe that our government's
approach to approving and integrating biosimilars in our health 
system would impact overall potential for competition and 
access to more affordable life changing drugs for patients. 
Let's hope we can continue to support this developing market so 
that patients can realize the value and benefit of such 
treatments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Mr. Eyles, the complexity of the drug supply chain is hard 
to overstate as evidenced by all 10 of our witnesses this 
morning. They've been in the growing chorus calling for greater 
transparency in the drug supply chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Some states have already taken action. California recently 
enacted legislation that would require reporting of certain 
price hikes and legislation that would be introduced in both 
the House and the Senate--that has been introduced would create 
a similar federal requirement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;What we've already seen is some good actors taking 
meaningful steps to increase transparency. For example, Sanofi 
and Janssen have agreed to disclose their drug price increases 
each year. Sanofi also announced it would put limits on how 
much it will increase drug prices. But as you note in your 
testimony that more could be done to encourage open and 
straightforward price setting and highlight the need for 
disclosure of intended launch price.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;    Could you discuss further why the disclosure of intended 
launch price would be helpful to insurers and how you believe 
such a disclosure be operationalized?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;Thank you, Ranking Member Green.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;Yes, we've been very supportive of greater transparency 
into really both when it comes to launch prices and price 
increases.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;While we are not supportive of controlling prices, we think 
it is important to have more information out there in the 
public domain about exactly how prices are set. Right now, 
pharmaceutical prices are set in the black box.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;    When a new product gets launched with a price of $475,000 
no one really understands how that got set.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt; Well----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;We think ahead of time, having additional
visibility into how prices get determined by the manufacturer 
and then price increases over time, particularly those on 
higher cost drugs and those that exceed certain thresholds, 
it'll be important to understand other parts of the health care 
system have oversight and controls on them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;    For example, insurers have to report all of the inputs into 
their rates before they get approved. We are not looking to 
have specific approval of drug prices but we do think it is 
important to have greater transparency and greater dialogue 
around how are prices being set up front.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you. I know I am over
time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;    But transparency always works and, like you said, it works 
in other parts of the health care delivery system. So thank you 
for the time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; Gentleman yields back. Chair thanks the
gentleman. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky, 
Mr. Guthrie, vice chairman of the Health Subcommittee. 5 
minutes for your questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt;Thank you very much. Thanks for everybody
being here today, and it is really a great day to start this 
process. I was invited not long ago to the White House with the 
majority leader and we met with the President. I want to tell 
you, we walked away with the President wanting action on this 
issue. He's very focused on it. I think this is the beginning 
of a process that I hope will lead to an action as we move 
forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt;I have some prepared questions but I will get back to what 
the chairman said. I don't think we ever got a really good 
answer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt;    If insulin is a competitive product and it was $90 10 years 
ago and it should be $100 if you just went through the standard 
inflation, why is it $400? It's got to be somewhere between 
here and here it has increased in price and maybe, Mr. Merritt, 
you'd like to address that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Yes. And this happens with a lot of drugs, but
you see it a lot in insulin is there are insulin products but 
they have new methods of administration--actually some better 
methods of administration and that creates a whole new patent 
protection for these products.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;And so that is how the prices go up and, again, on a very 
basic point, drug makers can charge whatever they want for a 
product. That's not saying a price is right or wrong but it has 
nothing to do with anybody at this table except for the drug 
manufacturers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;All that we can do is get the biggest rebates possible, the 
biggest discounts possible, pass it on to the plans and 
employers and have them use it to reduce premiums, cost 
sharing, or whatever each plan wants to do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    But just the fact that we don't control the prices, that 
they have patent protection with minor changes in the products, 
again, making the products better, that's what gives them that 
pricing power.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; So the insulin--so Ms. Reilly, that would--so
innovation has come from PhRMA. Therefore, you have invested 
the research dollars so you're recapturing those resources 
dollars, therefore it is four times what it was?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Well, Mark is correct that there have been
significant advancements in insulin. We now have long-acting 
insulins. We have an insulin that's injectable with pens and 
other things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;But, again, I would say the list price of the medicine is 
not what the manufacturer retains, and in the case of the 
insulin marketplace, there are multiple competing products.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;What manufacturers have retained over the last 5 years has 
been stable or declining and part of the reason for that is we 
do have PBMs that are buying these medicines that, again, CMS, 
MedPAC, and others have demonstrated that what they prefer is a 
high list price and a high rebate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    That lowers the net price considerably. The rebates on 
average in the insulin market space are 65 percent.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; Well, who sets the list price then? For what
the PBMs have to charge, who sets the list price?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Well, and I want to respond to something that
both Mark and Matt said with regard to the list price. The list 
price is not set in a vacuum.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Our companies have to engage with PBMs and insurance 
companies every day in determining the list price and their 
preferences, quite honestly, matter significantly. And they 
matter to the extent that if they want a high list price with a 
high rebate and they're telling a company when they control a 
hundred million lives, an individual one, that is their 
preference if that product is to get on formulary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    Commonly, PBMs pick and choose amongst insulins and they 
say to a company, if you don't give me the price I want, you're 
off my formulary. And if you are buying on behalf of a hundred 
million Americans, more than countries like France and Germany, 
the leverage they exert is significant.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; So would you argue your market price is the
list price less rebate? You know that going in----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Yes. Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    Mr. Guthrie [continuing]. Therefore, you have to set a 
higher list price to get the market price that you think you 
need to cover your--same way with biologics?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; Just to stay flat. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; To stay flat.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;If I could just jump in for a second, it would
be an anti-trust violation for those discussions to ever 
happen. Those discussions don't happen. Manufacturers set the 
price according to however they want to move their products, 
whatever they think they need to do. PBMs have zero input into 
that. Health plans have zero input into that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    Of course, we get the biggest rebates that we can, but 
remember, this is a chicken and egg thing. If the price goes 
up, we are going to get a bigger rebate because our clients, 
Matt's companies and others are going to demand us to get 
bigger and bigger discounts. But the----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; I would argue----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; No, I am not done yet. But the list prices are
the list prices, and that is a drug maker thing. It has nothing 
to do with----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; Well, let me----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt; Mr. Chairman, I--Mr. Chairman----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; Not--let me----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt; He interrupted her testimony.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; I am going to let you finish your thought.
Then----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Yes. That's what I am saying. It's just a
basic thing. I think sometimes you can try to over complicate 
the whole issue of supply chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    Supply chain is just how you distribute products. Every 
industry uses them. They're not exotic. They all use rebates.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; I got about 40 seconds. Yes, let me go back
to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; I would say you have to ask the question that
if our revenue is flat or declining in the space of insulin and 
the list price is increasing? It's benefiting everyone that's 
paid off of the list price including the PBMs and the health 
plans.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; So the argument the rebate doesn't go to the
consumer?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; No, it does not get passed----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; Do you have an answer for that, Mr. Merritt?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; It does. It goes to the client who may use it
to reduce the cost of that particular drug--the cost sharing, 
or more commonly it is used to reduce overall.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; I guess I will have Administrator Eyles and
AHIP. So the rebate does go to the consumer?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt; They go to people who purchase health insurance
coverage. Yes, they go to everyone. That's right. So when you 
look at filings that insurance companies have to file with 
every state department of insurance, there are specific lines 
dedicated to pharmaceutical rebates and when rates get approved 
those rebates are taken into account. There are different----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; I would argue that's a perversity of insurance.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt; Time is expired. I wish I had more time with
that but----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; Right. The purpose of insurance is for healthy
to subsidize the sick. We are evolving to a system where the 
sick are subsidizing the healthy through rebates.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Gentleman yields back his time. Chair thanks
the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey 5 
minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I have long believed that one critical component of the 
successful drug supply chain is a robust generic manufacturing 
presence and market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Generics can continue to play a role in fostering increased 
competition and affordable access to medications, which is why 
I've continuously worked to provide generics with a level 
playing field and supported increased assistance and incentives 
including most recently through the FDA Reauthorization Act as 
a way to encourage a strong generic presence in our 
pharmaceutical market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So I wanted to ask Mr. Davis a couple questions. In your 
testimony you noted that generics operate under a very 
different business model than brand drug manufacturers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    Can you further discuss how the business model for generic 
drugs is different than brand drugs and the different 
considerations generic drug manufacturers take into account 
when making product development decisions?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Thank you, Ranking Member Pallone, and thank you
for your leadership on ensuring a level playing field. I am 
happy to address that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;The debate that you just heard between the branded industry 
and the PBMs and the insurers on rebates as a percentage of 
list price and discounts are for 11 percent of all 
prescriptions in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;It is not the generic business model. So if there is one 
thing I leave this committee with today it is to think of 
generics differently than the way you think about policy that 
impacts the branded industry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;We are a commoditized, not monopolized industry. As a 
result of that, the way the supply chain actually leverages 
driving prices down to where we are in 16 consecutive months of 
price deflation is by combining their resources and leveraging 
their purchasing ability where there are now three wholesaler 
retail pharmacy consortiums that are controlling 90 percent of 
the generic supply chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;So you have three suppliers who are driving the prices down 
lower than they have ever been before in the generic 
marketplace and as a result of that they are moving 
increasingly toward what are called single-sourcing contracts 
meaning they want to partner or contract with one generic 
company to fill a majority of their portfolio of purchasing 
needs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;As a result of that, what we have seen is, quite frankly, 
an unsustainable supply chain for generics moving forward, if 
in fact we can ensure that there is robust competition on the 
buyer side in addition to the seller side.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;In 2000, there were approximately 200 wholesalers on the 
market. Today, there are three that control 90 percent of the 
supply chain. The buyer side is three.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    We are still 20 to 30 competitive generic manufacturers all 
competing for that business, and economics will dictate over 
time that you will see more consolidation on our side in an 
effort to level out that negotiating table.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;All right. I want to ask two more questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;You talked about how generic manufacturers operated in this 
commodity style market as a result of the multiple 
manufacturers marketing the same product.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    But do you want to explain a little better the role that 
plays in bringing the generic drug to market?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt; Happy to do so. You have----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt; And then I've got one more question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Sure. You have a situation, Congressman, where
the ability for a generic manufacturer, when you actually get 
to what's called commoditized pricing in the generic 
marketplace, a decade ago it took eight, nine, or ten generic 
competitors to get to 80 to 85 percent off the reference for 
the originator price.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;You get there now as soon as three, four, or five generic 
entrants, which is why the FDA commissioner has prioritized not 
just the first generic application at FDA but the first, 
second, and third.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    Our companies have to make decisions in a commoditized 
market that has varying price fluctuation upward and downward 
about what the sustainability is of the competitive market in 
any therapeutic area. So that's a significant factor in 
determining if they go to market once they get approved and if 
they stay on the market once they are approved.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;All right. Then lastly, let me just ask
briefly about the rebates. We've heard quite a bit of debate 
about the appropriateness or value of rebates in the drug 
supply chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    So what role, if any, do rebates play in the negotiations a 
generic drug manufacturer undertakes with payers and how does 
reimbursement traditionally work for generic drugs?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Thank you for that. It's an important
distinction. As I said, for 89 percent of the prescriptions in 
the U.S. that are generic, the traditional rebate model by and 
large does not apply.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Generic companies are reimbursed in many ways based upon 
two things: their ability to meet that wholesaler demand with 
the three who control 90 percent of the market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;By saying can you meet our volume requests and are you 
willing to meet the price that we are actually going to tell 
you we are going to pay for that product--let's take generic 
Crestor, for example, rosuvastatin--and if you don't--and if 
you're not willing to offer it at 10 cents a capsule, one of 
your 19, 20, or 21 other competitors that are also marketing 
that will, and we will cut you out.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    So it is really about volume and ability to keep your price 
as low as possible. So it is an example of the market actually 
working.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt; All right. Thanks a lot, Mr. Davis.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Gentleman yields back. The chair thanks the
gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;The chair recognizes the gentlelady from Tennessee, Mrs. 
Blackburn, 5 minutes for questions, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I appreciate that, and I appreciate the discussion that we 
are having here this morning on this issue. I will say I am a 
little surprised. There's a lot of finger pointing that is 
going around.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;But I will tell you all, I think there is more than enough 
blame to go around for what we see transpiring in the 
marketplace and with the high cost.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And listening to you all, I will tell you there is 
absolutely--it confirms to me why so many of my patients--my 
constituents will say as a patient who takes something 
regularly, they have tried to find other options in the 
marketplace--programs like GoodRX or I know there are several 
others--because they are very frustrated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And Mr. Mitchell, I appreciate the concerns that you bring 
to bear as a patient and someone who is using something. This 
is an issue that we need to address, and we need your best 
efforts in solving this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;So I am going to focus on not things in the past, but as we 
move forward. And let's put our attention there. And for each 
of you on the panel--and we are going to start with Ms. Reilly 
and work all the way down--what change would you like to see in 
the marketplace or what change in law should we make to make 
certain that, as Chairman Walden said, we are focused on 
access, delivery, and the cost of these pharmaceuticals to 
patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Now, you are only going to have about 30 seconds. So Mr. 
Merritt, listen--make that good and concise for me. OK. Ms. 
Reilly, you are on. Let's go right down the panel.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Great. I would say two things. The first, as I
mentioned before, passing through those robust discounts and 
rebates that totalled over $100 billion last year back to 
patients. That would lower patient drug costs immediately.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;The second, which is more of a mid- to longer-term option, 
is moving our system towards one where-which moves towards a 
value-based system away from volume. Let's reward companies 
that deliver medicines that are delivering the outcomes that 
patients and payers want.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;I mentioned at the outset that we are part of a coalition 
with insurers, PBMs, and others, and one of the ideas is in 
fact exactly what you were talking about in terms of patient 
information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;We need to empower patients. Right now, they do not have 
good information about their choices. They don't know about 
their formularies. Their formularies are constantly changing 
throughout the year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;Their prices are changing, their co-pays, their co-shares. 
If they had more access to good information they'd be able to 
find cheaper medicine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. OK. Time's up.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Congresswoman, thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;There are three things that we would recommend. The first 
is to repeal the misguided Medicaid penalty on generic drugs. 
It was passed in the fall of 2015 as part of the balanced 
budget agreement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;It actually punishes generic manufacturers in the 
circumstances where they don't take a price increase, and 
serves as a disincentive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    Pass the CREATES Act, as I mentioned earlier, and include 
biosimilars in the coverage gap for Part D to ensure a robust 
biosimilars market, moving forward.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;As wholesalers, we don't actually take positions on 
transparency or on pricing issues. But I would say that our 
members would support anything that examines greater 
competition in the marketplace and better access for patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;I agree with a couple things that were said
before. Value-based contracting would be great. The patent 
reforms that Chip and the generics industry have talked about, 
and also something that we haven't talked about and may not 
come up today but electronic prescribing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    We'd like doctors to be able to look at the formularies 
before they prescribe the drugs so patients aren't surprised at 
the pharmacy as they can choose the least expensive option 
available.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;Solutions that bring more competition through
generics and biosimilars. That's the first thing. That's very 
important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;    The second is greater price transparency, both about how 
prices get set and how prices are increased, and we'd agree 
that it's important to also move towards value-based pricing 
and outcomes-based pricing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;I would agree with a number of the things that
have been said already--greater competition, greater 
transparency. I would agree on the CREATES Act as a piece of 
legislation that should move forward and, of course, as I 
mentioned in my statement, protecting the 340B program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;Dr. Harmon. I would tell you that not only is Mr. Mitchell 
the formal patient representative. All of us in the room are 
either patients or caregivers for patients. So we all wear that 
same appellation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;    As a provider, as a physician, what I would like to see is 
transparency. It's been alluded to. That's not just a buzzword. 
It needs to be a reality and I need to eliminate these 
administrative hassles that interfere with delivering care for 
my patients. Thanks.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;I have three suggestions. One would be the
transparency with spread pricing. That's what the pharmacy has 
paid and what the employer is charged, which are two different 
things. The employers charged more. The second would be 
pharmacy DIRs at the point of sale or prohibiting pharmacy DIRs 
altogether, and then the third would be eliminating the 
conflicts of interest that exist between a price giver and a 
price taker.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;    So they're giving prices but they're also taking a price, 
and there is an immense conflict of interest. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;I would focus on promoting competition and
making Hatch-Waxman work as intended. That means no more pay-
for-delay. There's a bipartisan bill to do that now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;The CREATES Act is an incredibly important bipartisan bill. 
It would save more than $3 billion. That is important. But all 
elements of patent abuse that extend patents beyond what you 
intend with our laws should be addressed to promote competition 
because competition lowers prices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. You all did a great job staying under the 
time limit. I thank you all.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;And as I yield back, I will just say listen to what you 
said. Transparency, competition--basically, focusing on the 
patient and those are worthy goals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    I thank you for the hearing and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; Gentlelady yields back. Chair thanks the
gentlelady. Chair yields to the gentlelady, Ms. Matsui from 
California, 5 minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;High drug prices are really at the top of the mind of our 
constituents and we've seen recent examples of extreme bad 
actors raising prices purely for profit motives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Congress does need to review and better understand drug 
pricing to ensure that we are incentivizing research and 
innovation and development of new drug treatments and cures 
without creating loopholes that can be taken advantage of.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Drug pricing is particularly complicated because it is not 
transparent to the public and because drug companies often end 
up with monopolies, which we all know can drive up costs. We 
need an approach that focuses on the patient and the cost to 
the health care system, which will be tethered by ensuring that 
there is sufficient competition in the market place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Where there is more than one option for a drug or 
treatment, costs tend to be driven down. As we move toward 
precision medicine, we move away from multiple treatment 
options per person.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;So this is something we will only have to grapple with more 
and more. I know we talked about this. Let me follow up here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Ms. Reilly, when drug companies set the initial list price 
for the drug from which all of the components of the price 
follow, do manufacturers also publish or make available how 
they determine the list price?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Well, companies--and to be honest, as PhRMA we
don't engage with our companies in terms of how they price 
their products. We can't for anti-trust reasons.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;However, many companies have talked about their 
philosophies with regards to how they price their product and 
they look at a number of factors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    They look at the prevalence of the disease. They look at 
existing treatments that are already in the market.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt; How about the research and development costs
that the company has done?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Research and development is a cost of doing
business that, obviously, has to be recouped. But companies 
really are focusing on the value that a given medicine is 
bringing to market and the list price that we come up with is 
very much negotiated with the purchasers of the product.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    A PBM or insurance company does not have to cover our 
product. In fact, some proudly talk about the fact that they 
exclude certain products from formularies if they don't get the 
price that they want. So they're not done in a vacuum.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;All right. Let me switch here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Dr. Harmon, when a doctor prescribes a drug, how often do 
they know how much it will cost a patient?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Dr. Harmon. Representative Matsui, they really only know if 
they do it a lot, because if I de novo prescribe a drug I have 
no idea. You heard it from some of the other panelists.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Increase transparency on drug pricing and availability and 
formulary would greatly enhance my ability to adequately and 
accurately prescribe the right treatment for the right patient 
at the right time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;So when doctors are familiar with certain drugs
that they prescribe, they know to recommend to their patient if 
they have two generics that do the same job as a named drug.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Do you tend to use this price information in a systemic way 
or anecdotally from what they hear from the patients?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Dr. Harmon. Systemically. I try to be an evidence-based 
prescriber. So I deal with my medical literature and up-to-date 
treatments that are made available to me. I make that decision, 
Congresswoman Matsui. But also 99 percent of the time I write 
on my prescription blank or I sent the electronic prescription 
substitution authorized.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Dr. Harmon. Generics are available. Rarely do I prescribe 
the brand name. The only exception is if I know that their 
insurance plan ahead of time will authorize the brand and 
actually have a better affordability to the patient than a 
similarly priced generic.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;OK. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;I want to ensure that we continue to encourage innovation 
and development of new cures and the ability to profit as part 
of that when you are in such a risky business.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    But I think the profit has gotten way out of control in 
many cases. I want to make sure the potential for profit is 
truly incentivizing innovation, not just lining investors' 
pockets.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt; What are examples of biologic companies that
are innovating but also keeping prices low?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;I think the vast majority are, and so we've
seen, particularly over the last couple years but we've seen 
incredible market competition in biologics, not necessarily by 
biosimilars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;I agree with Chip on some of his comments there. But among 
branded biologics there is intense competition. In fact, the 
time to entry for the second biologic in a class has dropped 
dramatically.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;    And so what you are seeing is a lot of great competition 
and the second and third products are coming in usually cheaper 
than the first.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt; OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt; So we are seeing a lot of good competitive
market dynamics in biologics.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Well, I would say so, but I think when you
increase more competition and eliminate the monopolies, because 
there are still some loopholes and ways for players along the 
chain to take advantage of this system with our without 
competition.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    So do you see--I guess Mr. Mitchell--do you see policy 
solutions that encourage innovation but close loopholes?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt; Can you pose that question again, ma'am? I
didn't hear it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt; OK. Do you see policy solutions that encourage
innovations but close loopholes?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt; I think, most importantly, that we want to
incentivize companies to invent new drugs and not invest time 
and money to milk money out of old drugs, and that's why I 
place the emphasis in what I said to the lady from Tennessee on 
closing patent loopholes----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Mr. Mitchell [continuing]. That allow them to get more time 
beyond that which you intend under Hatch-Waxman instead of 
focusing their attention on developing new drugs, making more 
innovation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt; All right. Thank you very much.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;Ms. Matsui, if I just may respond real quick,
I think it's important to emphasize that the time to market for 
generics has stayed the same for two decades.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;    So the idea that there is all this patent evergreening and 
that innovators are getting all these new patents and pushing 
out the time for generics the data just doesn't support that. 
Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt; OK. Thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Gentlelady yields back. Chair thanks the
gentlelady.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Barton, 
5 minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member
Green, for holding this hearing. We have established the number 
of witnesses we can have on one panel because there is no more 
room.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;So we know that the number now is 10. This committee has 
jurisdiction over quite a bit of the U.S. economy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;The three most complicated issues we deal with in terms of 
pricing are the price of gasoline--when it's up everybody's mad 
at us, the price of prescription drugs, which we are talking 
about today, and the price of cable TV. And I may be using a 
misnomer for cable TV. It may not be cable TV anymore.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;But of those three, the one that is most complicated and 
the most byzantine pricing mechanism is drugs. I take six 
prescription drugs every day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;I had a heart attack 6 years ago and I have high blood 
pressure and so I take six drugs. I couldn't tell you what 
those drugs cost. My insurance company pays it. I pay a little 
bit of a deductible so I know what my deductible is when I get 
them filled every three months. I get a 90-day supply.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Some of them are Plavix or Plavix, Lisinopril, Lipitor. 
Those are some of the name brands, and I think everything I am 
taking now is a generic. I don't believe I use any of the name 
brands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;So it's good to have this hearing. I hope we learn 
something from it. It would be nice if we could come up with a 
simplified system for drug pricing and perhaps this hearing 
will begin that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;My specific questions are going to deal with the pricing of 
biosimilars. Now, Congresswoman Eshoo and I worked together 
several years ago to get a biosimilar title in what's now 
called the Affordable Care Act and there is just--it's been one 
rocky ride trying to get biosimilars to the marketplace.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;And recently Congresswoman Eshoo and I led a letter that 48 
other members signed asking them to have a separate code at CMS 
for biosimilars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Mr. Davis, you represent both the generic drug companies 
and the biosimilar drug companies. You mentioned in your 
written testimony that biosimilars are more complicated, 
difficult to develop than traditional drugs. Could you expand 
on that briefly, please?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Sure, Congressman. Thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Biosimilars are a subset of biologics. So the reverse 
engineering process associated with biosimilars is heavily 
science weighted and much more expensive over time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;So development programs for biosimilars can cost $150 
million to $400 million in advance of filing the application. 
So what we need to recognize is that there are similarities in 
terms of the value that competition from biosimilars will 
present to traditional biologics in the market once they get 
there that is akin to the traditional small molecule versus 
generic competition that we've seen for years in the branded 
side.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;At the same time, we do need to recognize that they are a 
different class of drug and as a result of that, through the 
leadership of you, Congresswoman Eshoo, and others, be able to 
have a pathway established here in the U.S. as part of the 
Affordable Care Act through BPCIA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;That pathway, as was suggested earlier, has not gone as 
smoothly as possible and there are several policy reasons why 
we are where we are, not the least of which was the potential 
to have different J codes for the originator product and all of 
the competitors in a separate one at CMS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Because of the leadership of this committee, CMS has 
announced a plan change to that as of January 1. So thank you 
for that as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Another solution that would increase the uptick in interest 
on the part of our members to make the investments they need to 
bring biosimilars to market will be making sure that 
biosimilars are treated like biologics in the Part D coverage 
gap.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    So it's actually our members asking to be held to the 50 
percent discount to make sure that the value that biosimilars 
from a pricing perspective doesn't get lost as people go 
through the Part D program.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Mr. DiLenge, as Mr. Davis just said, CMS has
announced that they're going to reverse their earlier policy 
and assign a separate HCPCS code for each biosimilar rather 
than have a single payment rate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Do you believe that this promotes a more vibrant and 
sustainable market for biosimilars and hopefully over time 
reduces prices?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;Absolutely. We need to be able to incentivize
for the reasons that Mr. Davis said. You need to really 
incentivize the biosimilar marketplace differently than you 
would a traditional generic marketplace.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;And so while you have all the generics in the same code and 
that works for that marketplace, it does not work for 
biosimilars. It won't spur the investment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;    I talked earlier today about the investment that's required 
for all types of innovation but biological innovation in 
particular is very, very expensive and you need to have the 
right incentives, and the Federal Government, the way they 
code--it sounds really arcane, coding, but it actually does 
impact what investors think about going into markets.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Gentleman yields back. Chair thanks the
gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon, Dr. Schrader, 5 
minutes for your questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Schrader&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Very good hearing.
Probably should have a follow-up, given the breadth of the 
group in front of us here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;At the outset, I am not someone that blames the 
pharmaceutical industry or the supply chain for the problems we 
are seeing. This is just an outgrowth of industry developments 
and the innovation that's out there, as pointed out, a lot of 
the starts on these innovative drugs fail--90 percent failure 
rate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;That's not generally a good business model. But these guys 
do it because they care about the marketplace and there, 
hopefully, is a profit to be made at some point in time. I 
would remind everybody that pharmaceuticals are not the highest 
cost in our health care system. But at the same time, they are 
one of the fastest rising costs and my guess is they will 
continue to increase in cost because of the tremendous 
excitement and innovation in precision medicine. It's 
wonderful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;As a little old country veterinarian that I had to do and I 
now look at as almost a barbaric kind of way are going to be so 
refined that people will not have some of the great side 
effects that we see today in the marketplace.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;But having said that, we are also stewards of the taxpayer 
dollar and as things get expensive and we have this wonderful 
opportunity in this country and hearing everybody talk about 
innovation that's now occurring in particular in this country 
that's great.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;But we have to be able to afford things, and therefore we 
have to ask some tough questions and hopefully work on how do 
we all together make this medication at least slightly more 
affordable to the taxpayer and, frankly, to folks in the 
individual marketplace also.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;    So having said that, Mr. Davis, can you talk to me a little 
bit about the REMS issue and restrictive access abuse--that 
sort of thing. Why, in particular, do we need an effective 
enforcement mechanism to address that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Congressman, thank you for the question and I
would be remiss if I didn't start by thanking you for your 
leadership on this issue as well as Congressman Welch.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;It's important because--let me start with--REMS was created 
in 2007 as part of the reauthorization for the prescription 
drug user fee program then, and REMS, in terms of ensuring 
patient safety is a very important program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;The original statute--the authorizing statute--also said 
that REM should not be used for the unintended consequences of 
delaying competition from generics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;The challenge we have is that's exactly what, in many 
instances, it is being used for and the reason that there is no 
remedy for it is because there is no sufficient enforcement 
mechanism in the authorizing legislation from 10 years ago, and 
there have been constant efforts on the part of generic 
manufacturers in 2012 as part of the first generic user fee 
agreement that coincided with the reauthorization of the PDUFA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    They came very close. There was a provision in the Senate 
version that actually would have remedied this issue. It's 5 
years later and it still exists. And if you want a robust 
biosimilars market and you want to make sure that competition 
gets to market sooner rather than later, claiming patient 
safety issues that have never been documented after the FDA 
certifies generic manufacturers will appropriately handle the 
samples they need to do the pharmacovigilance is just an excuse 
to prolong monopolies beyond their intended effect.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Schrader&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;Mr. Merritt, talking about PBMs, I remember a day 20 years 
ago when they were the godsend, if you will, to reducing drug 
prices and having someone knowledgeable deal with the panoply 
of drugs that are out there and getting it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;I would like to think that still exists, obviously, or 
people wouldn't be using you. There is a supply and demand. The 
reason they use PBMs is because they think they're getting 
value.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;Some insurers had moved away from that a little bit here 
very recently and everyone talks nowadays about this black box, 
and given the fact that you guys have to talk about some of the 
rebates when you are reporting to Part D and CMS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;    Is there a way to inject some transparency in what you do 
without giving away proprietary information in the private 
insurance market?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Yes. That's a great question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Yes, Medicare Part D is a great example because consumers 
have transparency. They choose their plans. They can see what 
the premiums are, what the cost sharing is, what the drug 
selection is of every plan, which is why you have 90 percent 
satisfaction with Medicare Part D.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;I agree with something Dr. Harmon said. It would be nice if 
there was that transparency in the doctor's office so people 
weren't surprised--the physician, the pharmacist, and the 
patient--as to what a drug actually costs a patient because 
Lori is correct, the cost sharing is different for different 
plans because different plans have different goals and 
different populations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    So if there was electronic prescribing and doctors and 
patients seeing what the actual out-of-pocket costs were in the 
doctor's office I think that would really help.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Schrader&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;Very good. Well, I've got a ton of questions
probably like everybody else here and I appreciate all the 
participants on the panel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;I guess, Mr. Chairman, it'd be nice maybe to have a work 
group at some point in time, work with all our participants, 
the patient groups also, about what are some of the best 
solutions because I don't think there is a silver bullet here 
that's going to require everyone to get in the boat together 
and figure out how do we make sure we still have the most 
vibrant innovative pharmaceutical market in the world that is 
increasingly doing amazing things, from my perspective.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Schrader"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentleman. Gentleman yields
back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus, 
5 minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;This is a great panel. Appreciate you all being here. I 
would recommend that we break it down. There's too many--
because I think all of us want to talk to each one of you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;I know you can all come and visit with us but to have that 
interaction. Some of you are going to get lost in the shuffle 
and we apologize for that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;I've spent a lot of time in this health care arena on 
orphan drugs, on antibiotic resistance. So and I, like some of 
my colleagues, understand the 90 percent failure rate, 
understand the R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;We want to make sure there is a return. We are the 
innovators in the world but we just have to be careful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;And then we've got these--how do you provide lifesaving 
drugs to a small population that you can't get a return just 
from selling that drug to that individual. So that's all part 
of this debate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;The antibiotic thing, which Gene Green and I have worked 
on, we are floating tradeable vouchers somehow, having the 
company get some way to get a return on that so that they can 
have a ready-made supply of something which you, hopefully, 
don't have to use. Can you imagine asking a company to have 
something on the shelf that you hope you don't use?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;So that's why you all are there for the right reason, 
trying to make the system work. I really do appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;This transparency debate is also key. It gets us frustrated 
and you just talk about drug prices in a hospital setting, but 
the hospital has a federal mandate called EMTALA--emergency 
room. Anybody can go.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;High cost--how do they balance that versus an outpatient 
clinic that doesn't have that mandate of that service? I think 
you always win with being transparent and then you help educate 
the consumer, and then the consumers say, well, that's why I 
have to pay a little bit more because, shoot, the hospital's 
paying for this emergency room access, which they have to do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;So health care is a most challenging and frustrating 
payment process that we have and many years I tried to stay off 
this committee because I didn't want to deal with it. They kept 
throwing me back on so I am stuck with it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;But I really want to talk to one provision too that I hear. 
I want to go to the local pharmacist. I think one provision 
that just really gripes me is this clawback issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    So here's what happens. Doctor gives a prescription to a 
patient. A patient goes to a pharmacist. They pay the 
transaction or the insurance, and then months later tell me 
what happens. It's hard to believe.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;You're leading right up to it, Congressman,
exactly to the punch line. So months later, the money that the 
pharmacy collected from the consumer is taken back by the 
insurance plan, or the PBM.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;    So for----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt; And the drug probably has already been
consumed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;Hopefully it's worked and that patient is doing
fantastic on it. But the payment is still in play.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;    So the pharmacy basically is forced to act like a mule to 
take the money from the patient and then that money is clawed 
back from the pharmacy to the health plan or the PBM.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt; Can someone tell me why? Can someone defend
that practice? Do you really want to try?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; No. No, we don't defend the practice. It's an
outlier behavior. It's something that is outlier behavior in 
the industry and we understand frustrations on that. And to the 
degree it exists, it exists rarely and hopefully more rarely in 
the future.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;Well, when our local pharmacists come to see
us, especially the community-owned small ones, they show us. 
They show us the bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;They show us the receipt, so I hope that people are 
listening to the hearing and saying, we got to fix this. 
Because it's just not right to offer a service, pay the cost 
and then for someone else later on to say, oh, you got to give 
us money back because whatever parameter. It's not truth in 
advertising.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;It's not truth in billing, and I am tired of it. I really 
am--and I hope it gets fixed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;With that, Mr. Chairman, I am going to yield back before I 
get more angry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair
would remind the gentleman that he was the ranking member of 
this subcommittee when we were in the minority and I was down 
on the first row. So he's got a lot of time in service here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Colorado, Ms. DeGette, 
5 minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Over the last 6 months, as many of the these panelists 
know, I've been working with Congressman Tom Reed, who is my 
co-chair of the Diabetes Caucus on what's going on with insulin 
prices around drug pricing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;And what we've learned across the whole drug chain is that 
there is a lack of transparency, which we've been talking about 
a lot in the hearing today, and we've also learned that there 
is a lot of finger pointing, which we've also seen in this 
panel today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;It's kind of good. It's frustrating to have 11 witnesses 
but you hear all of that. And so I want to kind of focus on 
this issue of the complex web of financial and contractual 
relationships between the players here with the idea that maybe 
we can get to some more transparency and the ultimate goal 
being to help the patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Ms. Reilly, I heard you talking about your view of how the 
market is working in your opening statement and I agreed with 
almost everything you were saying but you left one thing out 
and the thing you left out is why the price of insulin is $400 
to begin with.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Now, I know there are a lot of different delivery systems. 
There's a lot of different kinds of insulin. We've moved away 
from the animal insulin. We don't have a generic yet, although 
that's coming soon, et cetera, et cetera. But some would say 
it's not just the other players. PhRMA has a role in this, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;So I want to ask you and two other witnesses a very simple 
question as we go forward, and that is this. Will PhRMA, AHIP, 
and PCMA each agree to work with your member companies to share 
information with us about your contract with other supply chain 
players including sharing specific examples of contract terms?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Obviously, I don't want to undermine confidentiality. But 
until we know what the contract terms are it's really hard for 
us to get that transparency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Yes or no, Ms. Reilly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; Well, we as----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Yes or no would work.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; I don't have access to those contracts,
Congresswoman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Can you work with your members to try to get
us that information?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; You could probably work independently with
them. As a trade association, we cannot be privy to 
confidential information.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;You're not going to help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    OK. Mr. Merritt, can you help us with that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; It's a violation of anti-trust.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Yes. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; OK. And Mr. Eyles, can you help us with that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Now, I was listening with great interest to Mr. Guthrie's 
questions about the PBMs and I want to ask you a couple of 
questions, Mr. Merritt, about this because I heard you say that 
the rebates always go back to the consumers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    But I know from my investigation they don't always go back 
to the consumers in the form of lower drug prices. Isn't that 
correct? Yes or no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Well, yes in the sense that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; No, but we give the rebates to the plans and
then they sometimes----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Right. But they don't always go back in the
form of lower drug prices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    And so I want to ask you sometimes the PBMs actually make 
money off of the rebates paid by the pharmaceutical companies. 
Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; That totally depends on the client. The
client----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; But it could happen, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; If the client wants that to be that way.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Yes. That answer is yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Now, my understanding is that some of your member clients 
pass some but not always all of the rebates onto their 
insurance or employer clients. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; It's determined by the insurer but----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Right. That's correct. Some do, some don't.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; A hundred percent of the big employers
requires 100 percent pass-through of those rebates.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; But not everybody, right? Not everybody?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Probably because they don't want to.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Right. Yes. OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Is it true that PBMs sometimes make money off 
administration fees paid by pharmaceutical companies that are 
separate from rebates?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; There are different fee agreements and there
are different ways that we have to work----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And so the answer to that is yes, too, isn't
it? I am sorry?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Now, do your member companies sometimes include price 
protection clauses intended to insulate PBMs from drug price 
increases in your contracts with pharmaceutical companies?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; They're intended to insulate our clients from
price increases.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And so that answer is yes, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Well, our clients. So I guess it would be that
was there to insulate our clients from price increases. They 
want those there.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; OK. Member companies sometimes include price
protection clauses intended to insulate PBMs from price 
increases in contracts in pharmaceutical companies--yes or no?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; I guess it would be no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; OK. Do these price protection clauses
sometimes allow your member companies to make additional money 
through clawbacks when a drug's price increases?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; I am not aware of that in the clawbacks.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Yes. So if a drug price increases they can get
clawbacks. Ms. Reilly, you were nodding.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Oh, I see.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; Well, I was--yes, I actually have a document
right here and it states Express Scripts has more than 90 
percent of brand manufacturer contracts include price 
protections.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Can I get a copy of that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And Mr. Chairman, I would like to put that
into the record.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Without objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;OK. Mr. Chairman, as you can imagine I have
many more questions and I apologize for making you answer yes 
or no. We have 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I am going to submit these to the witnesses and I thought 
the idea that Mr. Schrader had to have a task force is an 
excellent idea.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentlelady. The gentlelady
yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Latta, 5 
minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and to
our panel, thanks very much for being here today. It's been a 
very, very interesting discussion we've been having this 
morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Several years ago, I sponsored the legislation on track-
and-trace, from making sure that we don't have adulterated 
counterfeit drugs entering the market. So this has been a 
really fascinating hearing that we've been having today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;And I am also working on legislation right now to modernize 
and reform the FDA's OTC monograph system. I would like to talk 
a little bit more about that to see how we examine ways to 
modernize the regulatory infrastructure of prescription drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;As members, I believe we should always be looking for 
avenues to reduce burdensome regulation, foster innovation, 
spur competition, and provide certainty for consumers and 
businesses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;And as we go forward, how can Congress help modernize the 
regulatory infrastructure at the FDA in order to bring these 
new medicines to market in a quicker manner? Because we had the 
hearing earlier this fall that was really fascinating to see 
how long it's been going back to 1972 when you are looking at 
45 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;    So Ms. Reilly, if I could ask you, what can we do as 
members as we look at legislation to help modernize this 
infrastructure at the FDA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;That's a great question, and I would
congratulate this committee on recent passage of the 
Prescription Drug User Fee Act, PDUFA and GDUFA as well, 
because that's a significant step forward in terms of 
modernizing the agency. I also think Commissioner Gottlieb has 
done a number of things on his initiative to move this in the 
right direction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;There are a handful of areas that I think still need 
further work. Combination products--EpiPen has come up on a 
number of comments here before and I think more needs to be 
done to ensure that when we have combination products, be it 
auto injector products like EpiPen that you have got two 
different parts of the agency that need to work more closely 
together so that we can spur competition, get those products to 
market sooner.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;I think innovative clinical trial design is another area. 
As was mentioned before, the medicines that are coming to 
market are very different than the medicines that came 20 years 
ago. And so we need to modernize clinical trial design and the 
regulatory tools that are used to review those products as 
well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    And then I would say we need to continue to advance 
prescription-focused drug development. Having the patient at 
the center through the process of the Food and Drug 
Administration is vitally important but ensuring that patients 
I also heard as reimbursement decisions and coverage decisions 
are equally as important.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;    Mr. DiLenge or--and Mr. Davis, would either of you like to 
comment on ways in which the FDA modernization or increased 
generics on the market would also help benefit our consumers 
and the patients out there?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Congressman, thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Yes, and then first I would second the recommendations that 
Ms. Reilly made. I think relative to the generic market, again, 
the leadership of this committee to pass the user fee agreement 
for the generics, we are only in. really, at the beginning of 
our sixth year of the user fee program with the FDA. The brands 
had a 20-year head start in many ways.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;So that system is much more refined. I think there is a 
shared both commitment and responsibility between our sector 
and the agency to make sure that we are driving as much 
effectiveness and efficiency through the generic and biosimilar 
approval processes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    A simple example is first cycle approvals for generic 
applications historically have been very, very low--abysmally 
low. Under the leadership of Dr. Gottlieb, that has already 
begun to change.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt; Let me ask you this. Why has this been so, you
know, dismal in the past? What has caused that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Quite frankly, I think if you look back I would
certainly say on behalf of our members through the first GDUFA 
implementation the first 5 years engagement between the FDA and 
the industry in the first couple of years as the Office of 
Generic Drugs probably could have been more robust and mutually 
productive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;By the time the FDA started having goals--associated 
timeline goals associated with approving ANDAs, they were well 
on their way to have already built OGD.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    The aggressive timelines in GDUFA II--8 months for a 
priority review, 10 months for a standard ANDA--will go a long 
way towards enhancing competition, getting ANDAs approved and 
then getting that competition out to the market.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt; Mr. DiLenge, would you like to comment?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;I would just completely agree with that. You
know, we've learned a lot on the innovator side about how you 
improve first cycle approvals by the FDA. That is critical to 
getting even more brand-to-brand competition in the 
marketplace.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;    We are doing that now on the innovator side. The generic 
industry, I think, can learn a lot from what we went through 
over the last 20-plus years of GDUFA and really learn with the 
new GDUFA how they can interact with the agency in a better way 
to get more generic drugs through the process quicker on the 
first tray.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt; Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My time is
about to expire and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; Would the gentleman yield?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt; If I could just add one follow-on comment?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt; Go ahead.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;It's critically important for us to get more
ANDAs approved earlier. Then we also need to make sure that 
there is a market where those holding those licenses will go to 
the market and not be tied up in endless delay through patent 
filings, extensions, evergreenings, and product topping as 
well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    Where Tom and I would disagree is that is increasingly a 
significant issue that's keeping generics and biosimilars from 
the market.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt; And we do respectfully disagree with that.
There is really no data to show that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt; Thank you. And now, Mr. Chairman, my time has
expired and I do yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Your time expired a long time ago. But I do
need to recognize the chairman for an informational message.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The chairman is recognized.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you, and with the indulgence the
committee, I know a couple of members have asked about we need 
to have a work group. We need to have some sort of rump group 
to address this issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Consider yourself on it if you are on the Health 
Subcommittee. That is the job of this committee. That is the 
job of other subcommittees that are looking at other things. 
The O&amp;amp;I Subcommittee is looking at 340B issues, about to issue 
a report.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;But this is where we are going to do regular order right 
here on the Health Subcommittee to look at the issues that you 
all are helping us get a better handle on, and I think there 
may be an opportunity to come back after the 1st of the year 
and continue this discussion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;It, I am sure, isn't the most fun thing for all of you to 
be at the same table together but it sure helps us, have you 
each go back and forth and tell us your points of view.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And so I appreciate the committee's indulgence. But the 
notion we are going to have a splinter group go off and do 
something, put a nail in that one because this is the splinter 
group.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;This is the Health Subcommittee. This is the Energy and 
Commerce Committee and we are going to go through regular order 
to get the answers that will work for consumers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I thank the chairman for the observation. This
is indeed the smoke-filled room.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The chair recognizes the gentlelady from California, Ms. 
Eshoo, 5 minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Eshoo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank
Chairman Walden for the comments that he just made because it's 
important that the work not only begin here but that the 
Members are responsible for shaping a policy around what we are 
discussing, which is so important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;I want to thank all the witnesses, all ten of you. Because 
I've listened to most--just about every--well, everything since 
we began, it's a good exercise to just sit still and to listen 
to the questions that are asked and the answers that are given.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;Here are my observations. Number one, and I am proud of 
this--the United States of America and its genius has produced 
lifesaving drugs not only for people in the United States but 
for people around the world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;So the research, the development that comes out of both the 
biotechnology industry, the pharmaceutical industry are really 
very, very important and I am proud of the work that I've done 
over the years to help advance that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;I am a firm believer in it. The other observation I have is 
if we were starting from scratch and you all designed the 
system that you are here to talk about today, it really sounds 
like a Rube Goldberg plan, I have to tell you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;And I don't blame any one of you. You have told your story. 
You're sticking to your story. But the fact of the matter is is 
that it's not working well at all and it's not healthy to have 
the antipathy in the country against you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;It's a very unhealthy thing. It really is, because on the 
one hand, people need the drugs. We had members speak to their 
own conditions and what they need to take.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;So this is crying out for reform. This is crying out for 
reform. And I think what I would just put you all on notice 
on--about is that we are going to reform. We need to reform. We 
have to answer to our constituents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;We have to answer for what the costs are in the system that 
we oversee. The Federal Government is the major player and 
payer in the United States of America when it comes to health 
care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;So there is going to have to be some give and take on these 
issues. Mr. Davis, I just want to say something about REMS. 
Yes, it put into place in 2007 and it was put into place to 
protect patients. You know that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;Now, the FDA is the one that identifies the issues that 
need to be identified relative to safety and it's why we have 
REMS. One of the drugs that comes to mind is sodium oxybate, 
commonly called the rape drug.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;So you said some things about REMS that I don't think are 
really accurate because the safety relative to these drugs that 
are very, very dangerous if they get into the wrong hands--that 
we all need to gather around that. That's a must.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;That's not a Republican issue, a Democratic issue. It's 
there for a very good reason because those drugs, as I said, if 
they fall into the wrong hands it's dangerous.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;I want to thank pharmacists. I have to tell you, in my 
community in California and Silicon Valley it's very difficult 
to find a small druggist anymore. They're gone. They're gone. 
They're gone. It's all the big guys now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;And I am not saying that they may not be doing a good job 
for people to get their prescription drugs. But I can't name 
one small druggist anymore, including a cousin of mine that was 
in the business his entire adult life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;So that says something about money because money is part of 
the business, and I think that that's a real loss in my 
communities and I guess communities in different parts of the 
country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;And to our friend at the end of the table, I think that you 
are a walking advertisement for the good things we did in the 
ACA because you would not be covered for anything in terms of 
what you are going through were it not for the reforms of the 
insurance industry that we took on in order for you to be 
covered and at least have peace of mind that you have coverage 
and that the lifetime limit caps were lifted as well because of 
the horrendous costs that pile up very quickly when you are 
dealing with what you are dealing with and I wish you well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;I really wish you well, and thank you for bringing together 
people on a bipartisan basis. We need you to work with us and 
congratulations on not being dependent on the money of anyone 
that's involved in the industry because it then actually, I 
think, diminishes or brings questions to the effort.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;So thank you to all of you and those are my observations. 
But I think that they more than hint at the work that we need 
to do because this is--if there were a chart that was brought 
into the hearing room today, starting with the top--research, 
development, and then where it goes and who's involved at every 
level--it would outdo Johnny Carson's roadmap that he used to 
point to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;    So thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to being a 
part of the solution at this committee relative to the cost of 
drugs in our country.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Gentlelady yields back. Chair thanks the
gentlelady.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. 
Lance, 5 minutes for your questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and my
thanks to the panel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Ms. Reilly, CMS recently announced in a proposed Part D 
rule that it wants to require Part D sponsors to pass through a 
portion of manufacturer rebates and pharmacy price concessions 
at the point of sale.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    What is the ideal way in which you think this should 
function?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Well, thank you for the question and I think it
is important and this is an important step I think that CMS is 
asking for information on this very issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;I think when Part D was originally designed the notion was 
just that, that the discounts and rebates that are negotiated--
and they are significant in Part D--they're larger than in the 
commercial marketplace--find their way back to patients at the 
point of sale.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Today, those dollars are used by health plans and not 
disagreeing with keeping premiums low as an important goal. We 
believe, however, in work that we've done that not only could 
discounts and rebates get passed back to patients, that we 
could do it in a way that actually saves the government money--
upwards of $20 billion over 10 years if we are able to pass 
those discounts back to patients because it will delay the time 
in which a patient enters the catastrophic phase of the benefit 
where the government picks up a large share of the cost and it 
will also lower the amount that the government is paying for 
low-income subsidies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;I think the proposal that was put forth in the CMS request 
needs some fine tuning. They talk about pass-through of 
discounts through a class of medicines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;We think it actually would work better if it was done on an 
individual product basis because, quite honestly, companies are 
not all that interested in providing greater rebates if they're 
going to be enhancing their competitors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Confidentiality is important, I think, to make this work. 
But I would argue this is a good step forward and could be 
transformational into changing some of the misaligned 
incentives that exist in the system today that, again, as CMS 
has previously noted, encourages insurers to pick drugs with 
high list prices and high rebates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    We want them competing on delivering drugs that provide the 
best value at the lowest net price and this is a good step in 
that direction.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; Would anyone else on the panel like to comment?
Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;You do see some point of sale rebates
happening in the commercial market where you have the whole 
health plan want to say, hey, look, we will raise premiums 
slightly in order to do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;We are seeing that happen there. In Medicare it's difficult 
because CMS has noted this would raise cost to taxpayers by 
about $80 billion and would increase premiums for patients. And 
the reason that happens is because Part D reimburses plans 
based on the premiums, and if the premiums go up so does the 
cost to the government.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;And so I think when you think about point-of-sale costs you 
shouldn't think about it in terms of reducing costs overall. It 
doesn't reduce costs overall.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;It just shifts costs to taxpayers if it's done wrong in 
Medicare and from healthy people to sicker people who need the 
medications and that's a policy decision as to how CMS wants to 
approve it--look at it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    One thing CMS said is if they do approach this, they want 
to do it in a cost-neutral way. I think that's the thing that 
we are working on right now is trying to figure out how that 
would even happen.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;Congressman, we would say that the rebates allow
for shell games to be played and because of the rebates those 
are often an unreliable--we do support pass through to the 
point of sale.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;However, we believe that it enables shell games if it's not 
properly monitored and already we are starting to see rebates 
being relabeled.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;So what was a rebate yesterday is no longer a rebate. It's 
an administrative fee. It's some different category so it 
doesn't fall into that rebate bucket.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;    So there is a lot of shapeshifting going on that further 
complicates the pricing of the product.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; And whose responsibility should it be to make
sure that that does not continue to occur? Does that require a 
statutory change or purely a change from the executive branch, 
in your judgment?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt; I think it would require a statutory change for
that to happen. I do not think that the--that CMS--I can't 
speak for them, of course, but I don't know that they would say 
they have the regulatory authority to really police that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; Mr. Mitchell, you wanted to comment?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Yes, Congressman, if I may, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;I just want to bring it back to the patient impact of those 
out-of-pockets paid on retail rather than rebate. The 12 
highest out-of-pocket costs for drugs on Medicare Part D 
annually range from $4,400 a year to almost $12,000 a year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;This really hurts people whose median income is around 
$26,000 a year. We need to fix something in the system and the 
proposal from the Trump administration to allow the point-of-
sale price paid by patients to be based on rebate if not retail 
is a good step in the right direction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    It will move some money around unless you change benefit 
design. But we think the tradeoff is great to help people who 
are bearing the greatest burden and spread it a little more, 
even though it may have a slight premium impact.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Well, thank you. I got through one of five
questions and I am already over time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    I yield back. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The chair recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. 
Schakowsky, for 5 minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Thank you for holding this hearing today,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;I think it's long overdue that this subcommittee and 
committee work on skyrocketing drug prices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;AARP reported that in 2015 the average drug price was 
$13,000 per drug for a year's supply and that's almost a 
quarter of the median U.S. household and four-fifths of the 
average Social Security benefit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Now, of course, not all of that money is out-of-pocket 
costs. But somebody ends up paying.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    Mr. Eyles, I want to ask you a question. Does the insurance 
industry have meaningful input into the list price?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt; No. We don't have any input into the list price.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; And does the insurance industry have any
information about what the various factors that go into it 
including how much spending goes to research and development?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt; No, that's not reported.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;So let's take Sovaldi for a minute. Gilead
bought Sovaldi for about $11 billion, investing zero dollars in 
R&amp;amp;D, and made about $11 billion in year one by jacking up the 
list price to $84,000 per treatment--per cure, really.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;We learned this from Dr. Gerry Anderson, professor of 
public health at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Burgess hosted 
him at a round table. And according to a Senate investigation, 
we found out that Sovaldi's business model was to reach about 
20 percent of the people with Hep C. There's one out of five 
people who might be able to afford it, and that includes people 
on Medicare. If their co-payment would be $5,000 they probably 
couldn't afford it. And the rest of the people, well, too bad.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;We talked a bit about insulin. Mr. Eyles mentioned the 
decade increase. What I had was about 300 percent including the 
percent--including the period, by the way, that Alex Azar, who 
is now nominated to head HHS, was at Eli Lilly. And we know the 
names of people who died because they could not afford to get 
the insulin they needed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    So this business model, this idea that we can just jack up 
prices past what people can afford, I wondered if our consumer 
could speak to that for just a minute.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Well, it's not just insulin. Insulin prices
have gone up 300 percent over the past 10 years and it's 
because we have an oligopoly that controls the price of 
insulin. They move their prices in lockstep and they increase 
prices because they can.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;But you should also look at other drugs like multiple 
sclerosis drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;They have increased 500 percent in price from 2004 to 2017, 
and when PhRMA says actually, our treatments are lowering cost 
of care, in 2004 the drugs accounted for 50 percent of 
treatment costs for multiple sclerosis but in 2017 they account 
for 75 percent of treatment costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    The drug I was on for 5 years called Revlimid, made by a 
company called Celgene, increased its price this year by 20 
percent. This is a drug that was invented in the 1950s and 
which is being kept off of generic is preventing a generic.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; Excuse me, so is your point that there was
no additional research and development. The price just went up?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;The price just went up. That's all.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    Thank you, Congresswoman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Thank you. I appreciate that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;I want to get to the issue of rebates. Pharmaceutical 
companies talk on TV during these ads that are ubiquitous--if 
you can't afford your drug come to us and maybe we can help you 
and my office, we take advantage of that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    But I wanted to ask, really, yes or no, Ms. Reilly, do drug 
companies get a tax break for those rebates?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; For the donations, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; For the donations. So if you set a list
price that is up here and then you have a rebate to make it 
cheaper for some, is it the difference between the list price 
and the rebate that is considered a donation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt; I would have to get back to you on that. I am
not sure how that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; But it could be as much as $100 billion
because that's what you were saying was about the donation. You 
said $100 billion.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;No, no, no.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    Those aren't donations. A hundred billion dollars are the 
rebates that our companies provide in terms of discounts for 
insured patients, right. That's totally separate from patient 
assistance programs that help patients that lack insurance. 
That's a totally different issue.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; How much is that money and--well, I am over
time. I would like to know how much goes into those programs 
and----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;I would be happy to----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Ms. Schakowsky [continuing]. How much of a tax break 
companies get for lowering the price.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Gentlelady yields back. Chair thanks the
gentlelady.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Griffith, 
5 minutes for your questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Thank you all for being here. I have to tell
you, though, you all have raised my blood pressure today. 
Everybody is saying that this is the problem and that's the 
problem and the bottom line is we have our working group, as 
the chairman said, which is going to be this subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I believe you all need a working group. Because if you all 
don't solve this we are going to come in and come up with an 
answer and it may not be an answer that you end up liking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Now, one of the things I've heard today that I do like is 
transparency, and I understand Mr. Mitchell needs the 
manufacturers of the drugs, biologicals, whatever--needs a 
consumer patient advocate, needs the insurance companies out 
there--we all need that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;We need our doctors. We appreciate that. Love my 
pharmacists. As you all know, I really think they're front line 
folks for health care and most people, at least in districts 
like mine that are mostly rural, they've known their pharmacist 
for years. They trust their pharmacist. They want their 
pharmacist's input, and we appreciate that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;But here's the question. Without transparency, Mr. Merritt, 
I can't figure out for the life of me why the insurance 
companies can't deal directly with the manufacturers and the 
pharmacists and what value is it that you are adding?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Because what we've got is a big black box, and we dump the 
drugs in and we got people pointing fingers. And I am not going 
to ask you because that's a question we are going to have to 
answer another day. I only have 3 and a half minutes left. 
That'll take hours.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;But what I am seeing and what the public sees is we've got 
this big black box called a PBM. They're saying they have to 
raise their prices so they can then give you a bigger discount 
and sometimes Mr. Eyles and the insurance companies like that 
and sometimes you like it and sometimes you get rebates back 
and sometimes you take money from the pharmacists back after 
they've already filled the prescription, or the insurance 
company does.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;But it all comes back. For the life of me, if we don't get 
some transparency in there--and there must be something you are 
adding to the system and I look forward to you telling me after 
the meeting in a written form what that is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;But I think we have to have some transparency so the 
average citizen in the United States understands why it is that 
you all are up here pointing fingers at one another and it 
comes back in big part to what's going on inside that big black 
box called the PBMs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Now, that being said, on the clawback, as I call it, or DIR 
fees, as you know, Mr. Hoey, I have a bill in along with my 
friend, Mr. Congressman Welch, and we've introduced a 
bipartisan bill that would put an end to this retroactive 
collection fees from pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    And it's interesting because we heard Mr. Merritt earlier 
say that's an outlier. But when I hear from pharmacists in 
Pennington Gap and in Pulaski and in Salem and in all the small 
towns in my rural district with 29 jurisdictions that they're 
having a problem with this, I think it must be the big boys and 
all of my small pharmacies are the outliers who are getting hit 
by this. Has that been your experience?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt; DIR fees are prevalent across every pharmacy that
we know of that does business with Medicare Part D, which is 
every pharmacy. So DIR----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; So it's not an outlier, from your
perspective?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;No. The consumer co-pay clawbacks, I would not
call them an outlier. Those are really one PBM that's doing the 
most damage there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;    But DIRs is across the board. It's suffocating independent 
pharmacies and it leads to some of the consequences that the 
congresswoman from California alluded to.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;And it's interesting because they apparently
do this analysis on Part D. I've been reading through the CMS 
rule analysis and at one point they say, our analysis of Part D 
plan payment and cost data indicates that in recent years,, DIR 
amounts Part D sponsors--that would be the insurance 
companies--and their PBMs actually received have consistently 
exceeded bid projected amounts and in another part of that 
analysis it says that that means it goes to their profit line.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Mr. Mitchell and the consumers out there aren't seeing all 
that in those savings. That's going to profit. Does that happen 
a lot, Mr. Hoey?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt; Oh, absolutely. So the DIR fees--I think the CMS
analysis from January show that DIR--over $80 billion have been 
paid in DIR fees over the last 6 years. And so where those DIR 
fees are going, some of them may be going to lower premiums. 
Maybe----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; And I suspect some of them are going to lower
premiums.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt; But some of it may not be going to that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;But here's the problem that the American
public sees and if I've heard about it I know others have and 
those may ask questions about it as well and that is I've heard 
stories--and they're anecdotal and people don't want me to use 
their names and so forth--where they've gone to their 
pharmacist.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;The pharmacist has told them this is how much it's going to 
cost and as I think it was Mr. Mitchell testified people are 
cutting their drugs in half or not taking all their doses 
they're supposed to, and the pharmacist will say, well, if you 
pay cash and don't use your insurance you can actually get it 
cheaper.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Because of all the finger-pointing going on down on this 
end of the table as to who's made the prices go up, you are 
actually better off to deal outside the system and just buy it 
for cash. Have you found that to be true?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt; That is correct in some cases, and the pharmacies
that do that are taking their business life in their own hands.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; I understand that. That's why I can't talk
about it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Can't talk about it much. So here's the
bottom line, folks. If that doesn't say that there is something 
stinking in Denmark, nothing else does.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;We are going to have to work on it and that's why you see 
Democrats and Republicans upset today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Mr. Guthrie [presiding]. Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    The chair recognizes Mr. Sarbanes from Maryland for 5 
minutes for questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Sarbanes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank the panel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;I want to thank in particular Mr. Hoey for your testimony 
and for the work of the association. I agree with just about 
everything that my colleague just finished saying and I hope, 
as many members have emphasized today, that the message is 
getting through that on a bipartisan basis we are kind of 
reaching the end of our tether.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;And a lot of it just has to do with trying to catch smoke 
when it comes to how this pricing works. We have the whole 
chain represented here, I gather, and I listened to all your 
testimony as I was navigating the traffic coming in from 
Baltimore this morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;So I did listen carefully, and I guess, Mr. Hoey, I would 
be interested--anybody else who wants to volunteer--but 
transparency is a word we hear over and over and over again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;    What are the two or three things--not to set you up in 
direct opposition with Mr. Merritt but what are the two or 
three things in terms of more transparency on the part of the 
PBMs that you would predict the PBMs would scream the most 
about if those provisions were put in place?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt; We've talked about some of them as far as the
rebates. That would certainly----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Sarbanes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;Mr. Hoey [continuing]. Cause, I think, a great deal of 
consternation. I think also there--on the generic side--and 
Chip mentioned earlier that 90 percent of the prescriptions are 
generic and there are very few rebates for those 90 percent. 
However, they're sort of a de facto rebate that the PBM 
industry has created.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;One of those is through the consumer co-pay clawbacks that 
we talked about. As we indicated, it's not every PBM that does 
that but it's about a third of the market. The second is on the 
MAC prices. So a MAC price is on the generic side and what the 
PBM does is they set a ceiling for that generic price. That 
ceiling can vary from pharmacy to pharmacy, from day to day, 
from hour to hour. So the pharmacy actually has no idea what 
it's going to be paid for a generic product at any time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;In fact, when the consumer walks in for a prescription, the 
consumer often doesn't know what they're going to pay for that 
generic price, for that generic prescription, the pharmacist 
has no idea, and really, the only entity with the perfect 
information is in the middle and that's the PBM.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;And until the PBM tells the pharmacy what to charge the 
consumer, the pharmacy has no idea what they're going to be 
paid and then what to charge the consumer. And furthermore, 
with DIR prices now, not only does the pharmacy not know until 
it processes that prescription, but it still doesn't know until 
months later when more money is clawed back from it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;    So those practices make it almost impossible to run a small 
business and to predict cash flow, to invest in capital, and to 
hire employees.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Sarbanes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;I appreciate it. I can't help but see an
analogy when we talk about how the prices can change from hour 
to hour and, frankly, as the PBMs would say that their role is 
critical and satisfying on demand need for drugs and the more I 
listen to it the more it sounds much like the discussion we 
have of the purchase and pricing of electricity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;We've been doing a lot of hearings in this committee on 
electricity--modernizing the grid, how purchasing of 
electricity has these middle operators that have to assemble 
the resource and then sell it up the line and so forth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;So that, to me, is a powerful analogy and, frankly, where 
it gets my head, just to send a shudder through the panel here 
today, is to the idea of regulation approaching a kind of 
utility regulation when you come--when it comes to drugs, which 
are needed by just about every American at some point in their 
life. This is something that traffics in the public space when 
you look at it that way.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;So this is where I come from, and somebody on the 
Republican side said that if the drug supply chain can't be 
improved then we may start out in a place that you don't like.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;But that's where my head is, and with that I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;Mr. Burgess [presiding]. Gentleman yields back. The chair 
thanks the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Bilirakis, 
5 minutes for questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.
Thanks for holding this hearing and I thank the panel as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Quite a few of my constituents bring this up to me when I 
am home on the weekends--what about the importation of drugs 
from Canada? Are they safe? Is it an idea that has merit?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Why don't we start with Ms. Reilly, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;I think there is, unfortunately, a misnomer
that importing drugs from places like Canada--our belief is 
that oftentimes, particularly when people go on the internet 
and they think they're buying a drug from Canada it often is 
not coming from Canada.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;In fact, in the past when the FDA did its investigation and 
ordered drugs from so-called Canadian internet pharmacies found 
that over 80 percent of them were coming from countries all 
over the world and many of those were not the medicines that 
they purported to be.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Is it fair to say that if I walked into a Canadian drug 
store today to purchase a medicine would it be safe? Yes, it 
would.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;But the Canadian market is 10 percent of the U.S. market 
and has repeatedly said that they don't intend nor will be 
responsible for supplying the U.S. drug market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;The idea of importation raises significant concerns from a 
safety perspective. We've heard from every FDA commissioner, 
both administrations going back for over 20 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    Trying to guarantee the safety of medicines that are coming 
in from all over the world is near impossible and would 
jeopardize a supply system today that has been remarkably safe 
for Americans.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; How about Mr. DiLenge? Do you want to
comment on that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;Yes. First of all, I agree, obviously, with
everything that Lori said but let me add another dimension to 
this, which is by importing what are you importing? You're 
importing basically price controls on American intellectual 
property that other governments have imposed through their 
negotiations of drug prices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;They don't negotiate the foreign governments. They impose 
prices because they're single purchasers, and what they are 
doing is, because I talked about it earlier, that vast majority 
of innovation is occurring in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;    They are basically imposing price controls on American 
intellectual property. It should be investigated as an unfair 
trading practice--and we encourage that the Trump 
administration is trying to look at this, finally, as a trading 
practice problem.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Anyone want to weigh in? Maybe there is an
opposing view.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Congressman, I would just add from the generic
perspective, and I respect and agree with the safety concerns 
that both Republican and Democratic administrations have found 
through the FDA commissioners, there is a practical effect with 
respect to generics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    Because we have a more robust market-based competitive 
environment for generics here in the U.S., generics cost less 
in the U.S. than they do in Canada as a market basket. So it 
begs the question why would you be importing something that's 
more expensive there?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;OK. Thank you. I will move on to the next
question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Mr. Merritt and Mr. Hoey, CMS recently published their 700-
page proposed rule for Medicare Part D for calendar year 2019. 
One component was their proposed implementation of the drug 
management program for at-risk beneficiaries from the 
Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act of 2016--and that was my 
provision.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;This drug management program, or lock-in, as we call it, is 
used in Medicare--of course, Medicaid programs and private 
insurance currently.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Have you had a chance to review the regulations and what 
are your thoughts on CMS's proposed implementation? We'll start 
off with Mr. Hoey.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;Yes, Congressman, we have had a chance to take a
look at that and overall we support the way the Part D lock-in 
program is structured.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;We would contrast that on the Medicaid program the 
prescriber and the pharmacy that the patient is locked into is 
chosen by the beneficiary and that's not the situation with 
Medicare. In the Medicare plan it would be assigned by the 
plan. So we are concerned about that freedom of choice from the 
consumer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;Also, with the Medicaid plan it's administered by the 
state, and the Medicare program it would be administered, 
again, by the plan. So we are concerned about that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;    And lastly, we would be concerned by--since the Medicare 
plan is administering it, any situation where the patient would 
be locked into a plan that also owns pharmacies or they're 
locked into their own mail order pharmacies.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; OK. Fair enough.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Sure. The key with protecting at-risk patients
is to make sure that they're going to one doctor and one 
pharmacy and those two medical professionals are communicating.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;The challenge in the past has been doctor shopping and 
other addiction-related behaviors in which people are dying. 
It's a real epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;The challenge we see at our first look at this is there are 
too many processes where you can't simply work with a 
particular pharmacy in a local area to a beneficiary and that 
they have 6 months essentially to work the system and not be at 
any particular pharmacy and we think for the at-risk patients--
not for all patients, not for all drugs--but for at-risk 
patients on things like opioids, that's a recipe for disaster.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    In 6 months people can literally lose their lives, and the 
whole goal of this program, I think, is patient safety and I 
think that's what the president has been talking about, too. We 
do appreciate your leadership on this, though.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Sure. Absolutely. Thank you. I look forward
to working with you in the future and get it right because if 
we are not safe nothing else matters as far as that is 
concerned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Well, I don't have any more time, unfortunately.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; Gentleman's time has expired.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Does anyone want to add something----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; No. The gentleman's time has expired.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;All right. All right. All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; The chair recognizes the gentleman from
Missouri, Mr. Long, 5 minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;Ahead of Peter? OK. I didn't realize that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="579" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;    Thank you all for being----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I thank the gentleman for pointing that out.
But Mr. Welch is not on the subcommittee. Do I have that 
correct? And as a consequence, we will hear from subcommittee 
members first.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    So you are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;I appreciate it. Thank you. Now that I have one
minute left----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;In 1966 there was a movie, ``Ten Little Indians'' and when 
I look at our ten witnesses here today, all these folks were 
invited to a luxury mountaintop resort where they started 
getting knocked off one by one from an unseen source. Nobody 
knew if it was one of them or who did it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;So I am thinking that if we had you all go off for the 
weekend and come back, whichever one of you comes back next 
week you'd have the perfect response to all of this and we 
could get this deal settled.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;But it's like Morgan said, everybody's blood pressure gets 
raised on this. But if you think that we are the ones to come 
up with a solution, I hope that we can figure out something 
between then and now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;Let's see. Mr. Merritt, I am given to understand that 
Express Scripts--one of your members or your members is the 
only or one of the only PBMs that have implemented a 
comprehensive opioid solution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;I myself have three friends that I grew up with that have 
all lost children within the last few years to this opioid 
crisis and to combat the devastating impact of opioid abuse, 
which includes, according to this, a 7-day fill, enhanced 
fraud, waste, and abuse prevention with providers and 
pharmacies as well as disposal bags for medication waste.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="589" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;    Can you tell us a little bit more about this program and 
when your other member companies will be initiating similar 
programs?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="590" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Well, let me talk about it as an industry as a
whole, and I do really appreciate those moves by Express 
Scripts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="591" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;I think what we see is that we are able to identify or the 
PBMs are able to identify people who are at risk. You can look 
at people who try to get the same scripts filled at multiple 
pharmacies, have gone to the same doctor to try to get multiple 
prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="592" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;You can track drug stores that have unusual dispensing 
patterns or--which aren't many but they do exist--and then 
providers or physicians who have unusual practices of 
prescribing and with that information you can identify at-risk 
people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="593" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;It really is important to do the most important thing with 
any addiction is to limit the supply and have monitoring, as we 
were just talking about with Congressman Bilirakis, of medical 
professionals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="594" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;And, again, this is not for regular people who don't have a 
problem. This is for at-risk people on particular drugs. 
Express Scripts has done a lot on that regard. We do see that 
happening in the industry more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="595" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    We are supporting electronic prescribing legislation right 
now, which would require these drugs to be electronically 
prescribed by physicians to a certain pharmacy so that safety 
could be improved. But, you know, we do see our industry taking 
a lot of good strides in this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="596" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;In my state of Missouri we don't have a drug
registry. We are, I think, the only state that doesn't have it. 
Our governor has tried to implement that but it hasn't really 
gotten off the ground.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="597" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;We are down in the southwest--at least my district, 
southwest corner of the state joining Arkansas, Oklahoma, and 
Kansas, and the doctors that work the late shift on Friday 
night and Saturday night in these ERs, folks will come up from 
Arkansas, Kansas, over from Oklahoma--we are very close to all 
those states--and their Dr. White is always retired. Dr. White 
retired in Arkansas and I really need my opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="598" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;So they'll come in and they'll want to get their 
prescription filled. Well, guess what? That doctor has got two 
choices. He can fill that prescription or, according to 
Obamacare where you have to rate your physicians, the doctor 
can say, I am not going to fill this prescription for this guy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="599" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;I know that he's addicted to it and he needs help but he 
doesn't need me to prescribe this. So he doesn't fill it then 
the guy rates him down on his rating and then he's no longer 
able to--so it's a huge problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="600" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;So anything that you can share that you can help us with in 
that regard. Like I said, being the only state that doesn't 
have the registry it's--and being right down in the corner 
where you get three other states that all do and all the folks 
come in on the weekends, Friday, Saturday night, fill up the ER 
begging these doctors for their opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="601" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;Ms. Reilly, real quickly, some call for government 
negotiation in Part D, framing the issue as if there is no 
competition in the marketplace or negotiation happening now 
when nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="602" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;    Can you tell us about the current role in negotiating the 
Part D program and how that's been responsible for bringing 
down prescription drug costs?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="603" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;Absolutely. I think Part D has been the model
of success with regards to competition. Today, as I mentioned 
before, those three large pharmacy benefit managers, they buy 
on behalf of 70 percent of all prescriptions in this country 
and they move their market leverage whether they're buying on 
behalf of Medicare beneficiaries are those in the commercial 
market to put additional cost pressure. They've done it in such 
a way where we've had high beneficiary satisfaction. Costs of 
the program are half of what they were expected to be when 
Medicare Part D passed and premiums have been low. In fact, 
there was an amendment offered in this very committee to try 
and set premiums at a price of around $50. That's never even 
gone into effect. We've never had an average premium that high. 
I think that speaks to the testament of the private market 
where there is a significant amount of competition.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="604" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    We talked earlier today--I think the evolution of the Part 
D program is to ensure that that robust competition and those 
rebates that are collected get passed back to the beneficiary 
to lower patient out-of-pocket costs.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="605" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;OK. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="606" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;    And Mr. Chairman, I don't have any time but if I did I 
would yield it back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="607" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentleman. Gentleman yields
back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;We have been in this hearing a long time and my goal is to 
proceed without taking a break because then we will have votes 
on the floor in a little while and they'll want to have to then 
delay things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;But if anyone does need to take a quick break if you will 
just do so quietly and then join us back and I think the 
committee would understand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    So with that, I will recognize Mr. Bucshon of Indiana 5 
minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Mr. Nickels, you seem kind of lonely there. No one has 
asked you any questions so I figure I might as well do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Yes. You mentioned 340B. It's a program that I
support. I have a lot of rural hospitals that really depend on 
it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;But I am concerned about the dramatic expansion of the 
program since the Affordable Care Act, and I want to make sure 
that the program is being used for its original intent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;And in that vein, I want to first remind everyone what the 
definition of a grantee is so that we know what the question 
is. Grantee eligible for 340B include black lung clinics, 
comprehensive hemophilia diagnostic treatment centers, 
federally qualified health centers, Native Hawaiian health 
centers, Ryan White HIV/AIDS program grantees, et cetera. You 
understand what grantees means.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;    So what I would say is in the interest of making sure that 
the program is being used for its original intent, would you be 
supportive of reporting requirements for hospitals similar to 
what 340B grantees are required to support, such as providing 
the number and percentage of individuals who are dispensed or 
administered 340B drugs disaggregated by insurance status, and 
the aggregate amount of reimbursement received for drugs 
purchased under 340B and/or provide contracts that would verify 
that a hospital meets the legal criteria for 340B eligibility?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;Thank you very much for the question, and to
your point, 340B is a very important program to your hospitals, 
to rural hospitals throughout the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;    It's worth noting that the expansion of the 340B program, 
which occurred in 2010, did expand largely to rural hospitals, 
to children's hospitals, and to cancer hospitals. So the 
dramatic increase has been because of the additional----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt; Fair enough. Approximately half the hospitals
in America are participating at this point, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt; Right. Right. Right. Many of which----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt; Which means half the hospitals in America must
be in rural areas.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt; Well, actually almost half are in rural areas.
That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt; Yes. OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt; But also remember that cancer hospitals,
children's hospitals, and then DSH hospitals also qualify for 
the program. So it's more than just rural.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;So the question is, it seems to me if
grantees, the ones I described, have--and it's complicated, I 
understand that--have requirements to justify their 
participation in 340B that it would only seem fair that pretty 
much every participant in the program should be able to show 
that they're benefiting low-income citizens, hospitals that 
can't buy expensive cancer medicine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;    And so the question stands. Do you all support that type of 
a change? Because right now, as you probably know, in the law 
it doesn't really prescribe that you have to justify where the 
money that you save is going and the reality is, in order to 
make sure, from our standpoint, that the program is being 
utilized properly we need that information.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;Right. So you are correct. The eligibility for
the program is in statute and not based on anything else. So 
there is subsets of my membership those are the ones who 
qualify.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="630" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt;    Having said that, we think they should all continue to 
qualify, but I do agree that further transparency in terms of 
where the dollars go is something we are certainly willing to 
discuss with the committee. We've been discussing it with HRSA 
for many years.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="631" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Right. That's the point--you are discussing it
for many years but we are not getting to an end point. So the 
question is it's yes or no. You support transparency and this 
type of thing or you don't.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;I understand the strategy if you don't support it is to 
draw this out for--until we give up and decide not to try to 
change the law. It's an up or down question to me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;I am all about transparency. I was a heart surgeon before. 
I asked my hospital that I worked at once, hey, what's the 
actual cost to do--a patient comes in, goes to the cath lab, 
gets a cath, goes to the OR, I do a three-vessel bypass 
surgery, what's the cost, and they said, well, we can't tell 
you that. And, honestly, they probably couldn't, necessarily.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;    So I am all about transparency. If the consumer knows, if 
the public knows, what's wrong with that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt; Right. No, I would say we are certainly in
favor of increased transparency, but not in favor of changing 
the statutory qualifications for the program that would result 
in rural hospitals being thrown off the program.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt; Well, that's not what we are trying to
accomplish.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt; But if you want to talk about transparency----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt; It's the hospitals in rich suburban areas that
are participating, that are buying up medical practices outside 
of their urban area and then adding all of those practices of 
the 340B program that I am concerned about.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt; Right. And, again, those hospitals though
still do have to qualify for the program based on the 
definition.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt; OK. Fair enough.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt; But I do want to answer your question, which
is yes, we are willing to discuss transparency and try to work 
on that with you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;All right. Fair enough.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Nickels&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Mr. Nickels"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentleman. Gentleman yields
back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. 
Hudson, 5 minutes for questions, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hudson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess and Ranking Member
Green, for holding this important hearing today. Thank you for 
all the witnesses. I know we've been here a long time. I've 
gone to the bathroom four times. I haven't seen you all get up. 
So congratulations on your fortitude.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;But I do really appreciate this discussion. I had hoped 
that today we could start peeling back the onion a little bit 
on this complex issue of the drug supply chain and really start 
the process of finding solutions and I think we've really taken 
a really good step in the right direction. I think there has 
been some great discussion back and forth. I know it is a 
challenge to have ten folks at one table.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;But I think the ability to have this exchange has been 
really helpful, certainly for me, and I am excited to continue 
to work on this, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;I would pose this first question maybe to the whole panel 
and whoever is interested in jumping in. But as more and more 
patients gravitate toward this issue that's been discussed 
several times today about people moving toward low-premium 
high-deductible plans, due to the high cost of insurance plans 
available today. Patients need to be educated on how to best 
utilize these plans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;Numerous studies have come out recently that show patients 
are not engaged in normal shopping behaviors such as discussing 
cost of service, comparing cost and quality services, or 
negotiating the price of services. Because patients are 
responsible for the full cost of their health care before they 
meet their deductible, expensive treatments during the 
deductible period can result in patients not adhering to their 
treatments, resulting in worse outcomes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;My question to whoever would like to answer this is what 
are you doing to educate patients on the tools available to 
them to lower their out-of-pocket costs specifically as it 
relates to drug treatments before they meet their deductible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;    So, I don't know--Mr. Eyles, I am sure you want to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Eyles&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;Sure, Congressman. Thanks for the question
because it's a really important one, particularly how we engage 
patients and then consumers so that they have the information 
that they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;And our members are committed to developing the tools. Most 
of them have very robust web-based tools so that people can go 
on, understand whether their physician is in network or not, 
what the differences are between formularies, co-payments, what 
qualifies for being covered before the deductible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;So at least for most individuals preventive services are 
covered before the deductible with no cost sharing so that 
people can go and get their annual physicals and understand 
what's available to them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;One of the challenges that we have, for example, with high 
deductible plans that are paired with a health savings 
account--and, again, our members are very supportive of that--
are some limitations on the ability to cover services that 
would be defined as preventive ahead of time. So we think there 
are some important modifications that we could make to HSAs to 
improve them, make them better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="659" speaker="Mr. Eyles"&gt;    But our members are committed to having very robust tools 
so that people understand cost, quality, and the status of 
their providers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Reilly&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="660" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;I would just also add, and I would agree with
Matt's comment about the need for a clarification in the IRS 
guidance to ensure that to the extent employers and others what 
to be able to offer a high-deductible plan with a health 
savings account that they can offer preventative services, 
things like diabetes medicines before the deductible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="661" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;I think the other important piece is we know from all of 
the literature that patients pick a plan based on premium 
price, and the lower the premium the higher the likelihood they 
gravitate towards those plans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="662" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;What they don't often realize is by signing up for a low-
premium plan they're signing up for a plan with a deductible 
that may be as high as $5,000 and that they will be responsible 
for all of the costs until they hit that point.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="663" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;One of the things that we pushed the previous 
administration on is to develop an out-of-pocket calculator 
similar to what exists in Medicare Part D where an individual 
can enter the information what drugs am I on, what physician do 
I use, so that they can get a real-life calculation in terms of 
what their costs are going to be depending on the plan that 
they pick.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="664" speaker="Ms. Reilly"&gt;    We don't really have that yet today for the exchange plans 
and I do fear that oftentimes people end up buying plans which 
are not in their best interest, that aren't going to cover the 
medicines they need, where their doctor is not in-network, and 
that's a problem and needs to be improved, and transparency 
that allows patients to make better choices should absolutely 
be paramount.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hudson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="665" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt; Mr. Hoey, did you want to jump in or anybody
else?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="666" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;I would just add those are both good ideas. I
had a patient contact me over the weekend who's taking an 
expensive subcutaneous drug for her cancer. The price went up 
$1,400.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="667" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;She said, I can't get anyone to explain to me why. I don't 
know who raised my price--my doctor, my insurer, the drug 
company. All of what Ms. Reilly just said needs to be done but 
there needs to be a way for patients to get their questions 
answered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="668" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    It could be online. It could be on the phone. But the 
system is impenetrable for us and somehow something that 
approximates what happens in other industries where customer 
service is important needs to manifest itself on drug pricing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hudson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="669" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt; Anybody else want to jump in?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="670" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;As far as at the counter that's one area where
pharmacists--we are sort of a rare breed in that we know the 
cost of the drug in some cases. We don't know when we are going 
to get paid but we know the cost of the drug and we know the 
therapeutic effectiveness of it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="671" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt;    So we can often help the patient, kind of guide them 
through, especially when they're hitting prior authorizations 
that Dr. Harmon mentioned or some of the other hurdles that 
they hit at the counter. We can sometimes help them with that, 
especially in those high-deductible plans.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="672" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; The gentleman's time has expired.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hudson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;Guess I should have paid better attention, Mr.
Chairman. I apologize.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;    Thank you for the answers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; Well, the only reason I interrupt is the
gentleman from Georgia, who has been very, very patient, and 
the gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes for 
questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="676" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank all of you
for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Mr. Merritt, I will start with you. Quite often, 
pharmacists are complaining about the fact that they're being 
threatened for mailing or delivering drugs by the PBMs because 
the PBMs own their own mail order pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;As you well know, pharmacies get contracts from PBMs unless 
it's a closed network and they can either accept that contract 
and the terms of that contract or they can't.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;If they accept it, then they can service the patient. If 
they don't, then they can't service the patient and that's what 
they're left with.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Just a yes a no answer, if you will, Mr. Merritt--do you 
agree that pharmacists should be able to tell patients that if 
they pay cash for a medication they can get it cheaper? Yes or 
no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="681" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="682" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;You do agree with that? Then why is it that
these contracts that I referred to earlier have gag clauses in 
it where it says that if the pharmacist indeed lets the patient 
know that if they pay cash it'll be cheaper, that they could be 
kicked out of this contract and that contract can be 
terminated?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="683" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Why is that? Can you explain that to me? If indeed, as you 
have said earlier, you are in favor of transparency, why are 
the gag clauses in there? Can you explain that to me?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="684" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; I don't know, and we as an industry don't
defend that practice at all. So, we want people to pay the 
lesser of and in fact almost all the plans work together. The 
PBMs work together with what's called lesser of logic so that 
automatically the person will pay the less.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="685" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Then why are the gag clauses in there? Why are
they in there if you truly want to take care of the patient, if 
you truly want them to get their medication why is the 
pharmacist running the risk of being kicked out of the plan if 
they offer this information to the patient?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Mr. Hoey, do you ever get any of your members complaining 
of this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt; All the time. Our members are intimidated and
most of the time will refuse to go on the record because of 
basically a business death penalty if they're caught talking to 
media, talking too much.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Mr. Merritt, during the years 2010 through 2015
CMS has said that DIR growth and rebate growth has grown 22 
percent per year whereas the Part D gross drug costs have only 
increased 12 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="689" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Can you explain why that difference is there? Why the DIR 
has grown 22 percent but the Part D drug costs have only grown 
12 percent? Is there a reason for that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="690" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Well, DIR--direct and indirect remuneration--
is an important discounting tool in Medicare Part D. The 
federal----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Can you explain why that difference exists? If
the Part D costs have only increased 12 percent, why have the 
DIR fees increased 22 percent?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Remember that--sure, and I understand. The
PBMs--we get the discounts where we can. We pass them back to 
the plans and the plans use them as they see fit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="693" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    Sometimes usually they want to reduce premiums. They want 
to reduce overall cost sharing. It depends on their individual 
strategy.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="694" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;And how far do these clawbacks of these DIR
fees go? Are you aware? How far back do they go? Because I can 
tell you that my wife's pharmacy in March got a bill for 
$10,337 that went back not 5 months but 5 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Now, let me ask you about that. Those DIR fees, did you 
credit the government or the consumer with that? Did you go 
back those 5 years and credit the government? Because what 
happens is this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="696" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;We got a Part D program that has, as you well know and 
everyone on this panel well knows, has a doughnut hole in it. 
Mr. Mitchell, I am sure you are in this. I am sure you have 
Medicare. You pay so much until you get in that doughnut hole, 
then you have to start paying for it. That means that everyone 
out here who buys drugs has to start paying for it if you are 
on Medicare. And when you charge those higher prices--the list 
prices we've been referring to it as--that pushes people into 
the doughnut hole even more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="697" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Now, listen. It gets even better, folks. What happens next 
is that when you get pushed out of the doughnut hole, guess who 
starts paying for it then? The taxpayer. All of us. We get to 
share in it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="698" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    My question to you, Mr. Merritt, are you sharing that? Are 
you sharing that with CMS to let them know, hey, you need to 
credit them back with this? Are you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Yes. CMS is aware of the DIR. They see all
this information and they've been very clear----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="700" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;So when my wife's pharmacy got hit for the
$10,337, this PBM went back and credited CMS with that and went 
back to the patient and said, oh, you shouldn't have been in 
the doughnut hole that quickly--we are going to go back and 
reimburse you that? So I just want to know because she's going 
to ask me tonight about that $10,337.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="701" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    I mentioned it was $10,337 because that's how much it was, 
and Mr. Hoey, have you had any other of your members who have 
experienced these type of things?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hoey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Mr. Hoey"&gt; Both on the retroactive. We had a call this week
from a member in the Midwest who went back 5 years, six figures 
on DIRs. Had another one just this year, also in the Midwest, 
one pharmacy taken back over $100,000 in DIRs from, really, 
three different plans.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; OK. The last thing I will say is this. All of
you said we need more transparency and I will tell you, Mr. 
Merritt, I pulled out your mission statement earlier today and 
it says pharmacy benefit managers reduce prescription drug 
costs and improve convenience and safety for consumers. Reduce 
prescription drug costs.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; How is that working out for everybody? If it
were working out we wouldn't be here now. If it were working 
out then we wouldn't have had a 1,553 percent increase in 
prescription drug costs since PBMs started--1,553 percent 
increase.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="706" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; CMS said the growth was 1 percent last year.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="707" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Mr. Merritt, transparency is the key. The most
immediate, the most significant impact that we can have on drug 
prices is to have transparency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="708" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="709" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="710" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont. Not on this 
subcommittee but we welcome you today and you are recognized 
for 5 minutes for questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="711" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Thank you very much and thank you for having
this hearing. I thank the panel. It's very helpful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="712" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;First of all, this hearing is not about the value of the 
pharmaceutical industry. They create life-saving and pain-
relieving drugs. It is not about trying to stifle innovation. 
Everyone on this panel wants to support that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="713" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;It is about the lack of restraint and the pricing power 
that the pharma industry has that is resulting in immense 
heartache for families, and you can create a life-extending 
pain-relieving drug. But if you kill taxpayers with the price 
then it's not accessible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="714" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;So I want to talk a bit about that. First of all, my 
colleagues have talked about transparency. That's essential. 
The opaqueness of the market works for the benefit of the folks 
pricing it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="715" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    Ms. Gallenagh, you said at the very beginning that the 
whole chain down the line starts with the list price, correct? 
And I think a number of people on the panel agreed with that. 
The pharma companies establish the list price, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="716" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="717" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; They have no restraints on what they can do?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="718" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; I would say that the constraint is only our
negotiation which, again, our net price is not what we earn, 
right, the list price.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="719" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Let me ask you this. Just get some things
established here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="720" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    When a company creates a product it gets a patent, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="721" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; Correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="722" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; And it gets a period of exclusivity.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="723" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; Correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="724" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; It has a monopoly over that product for a period
of time?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="725" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; It can sell that particular product. It
doesn't prohibit competing products that have the same effect, 
for example.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="726" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; That particular product----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="727" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; But we see significant competition well
before patent----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="728" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Do you have a problem answering the question?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="729" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; No, I am just trying to clarify.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="730" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; That product for which you got a patent is
something over which you control the price, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="731" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; We control the price in negotiation with the
purchaser of the product. Correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="732" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; And the price that you set is based upon meeting
obligations to shareholders in a return on profit, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="733" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; It is based on a number of factors--the
value the medicine provides and the like, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="734" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Is it the case that at the end of that patent
period that it is something given by public policy as incentive 
for doing the research any of your member companies have used 
legal maneuvers to extend that period of original exclusivity 
in the patent?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="735" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; It's impossible to extend the length of a
particular patent. The current system works this way as a 
result of Hatch-Waxman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="736" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Hold on a second. Have you ever heard the term
evergreening?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="737" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; I have heard the term evergreening. Of
course.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="738" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; And evergreening is extending the life of the
control. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="739" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; No. Evergreening the----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="740" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Has a company in your organizational group, ever
paid another company in return for not bringing their competing 
product to the market?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="741" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; Companies have entered into what's known as
a patent settlement wherein a generic company is trying to 
enter the market before the expiry of a patent.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="742" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; According to you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="743" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; Excuse me?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="744" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; According to your company. If you pay somebody
off not to bring their competing product to market, then you 
enjoy----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="745" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; The generic company----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="746" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; --the pricing power of that exclusivity perk.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="747" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; The generic company is trying to bring a
product to market prior to the patent expiring. There is----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="748" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Isn't there an argument over whether the patent
period is a set period in time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="749" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="750" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Exactly. So----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="751" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; And it cannot be extended beyond that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="752" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; It doesn't take a genius to figure out when that
period is up. It's called looking at a calendar, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="753" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; Correct. But drug----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="754" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; OK. So are you familiar with a recent effort by
Allergan where they took their products and paid the Mohawk 
Indian tribe to take, ``ownership,'' as I understand it, as a 
way of having better defenses against competition?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="755" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; Yes, I am familiar with that and they used
that through a process called inter partes review.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="756" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Can you give me any other example in the entire
economy of the United States where the owner of a valuable 
intellectual property would pay someone else to take ownership 
of that product?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="757" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; That has been used in other--universities
have used that, yes. It has happened.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="758" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; And give me a specific example.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="759" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; I can get back to you on it. But I know
there are universities that have----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="760" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; You don't have a specific example now?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="761" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; I will get back to you. I know it exists.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="762" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Is there anyone here who can justify a practice
where a seller of a product, like a pharmacy, after selling it, 
5 months, 6 months, or a year later has to rebate under a DIR? 
Can anyone justify that? Anyone--business model would it work 
with that situation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="763" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; If I understand your question, if you are
asking whether discounts and rebates are common in industries 
then I would say absolutely. It is very common for industries 
to discount and rebate their products. That's not uncommon.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="764" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; All right. So the situation that you've been
describing your company could work with if that happened to the 
pharmacy or if that happened to pharma?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="765" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; Different issue than what's happening in the
pharmacy. Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="766" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; So you justify what's happening to pharmacists?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Gallenagh&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="767" speaker="Ms. Gallenagh"&gt; No, I don't justify what's happening in the
pharmacy. Absolutely not.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="768" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; All right. Sir, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="769" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Congressman, I just wanted to add for a
clarifying point around the patents, you are right, and to the 
point that was made, a finite period of time as to when an 
individual patent is supposed to end.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="770" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;There is no such limitation on the number of patents filed 
on a product to extend its monopoly beyond the main ingredient 
patent that was originally filed and the best example of that 
is Humira, which generates the most revenue of any product in 
the U.S. and in the world at $16 billion per year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="771" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    In the 3 years leading up to the main ingredient expiry on 
that drug, that manufacture filed 50 new patents on that 
product. So even if they were ultimately struck down, that 
company continues to enjoy a monopoly while litigation ensues 
and that is why it is so important to maintain the IPR process 
in addition to the court process that we have in federal court.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="772" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Yield back. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="773" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Gentleman's time has expired. Chair thanks the
gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="774" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And I think we've been through the entire subcommittee with 
the exception of your chairman so I am going to recognize 
myself 5 minutes for questions, and I may not take all 5 
minutes because most of the information has been put out in 
front of the public today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="775" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I want to underscore what Mr. Griffith's line of 
questioning started with and the recent publication from the 
National Academy of Sciences on ``Making Medicines Affordable: 
A National Imperative,'' in the preface of that report, which 
is lengthy, but in the preface they make the statement that 
public concern has reached a tipping point, and they go on to 
cite several examples that may have caused that tipping point 
to have been reached.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="776" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;But going further, they say those examples have had a 
sufficient impact on the health of citizens such as to attract 
sustained public attention and concern.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="777" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;A September 2017 survey of adult American priorities for 
Congress through the end of the current year found lowering 
prescription drug prices to be the highest ranked above minimum 
wage, reducing the deficit, rebuilding the nation's 
infrastructure, reducing taxes, or any other of the six items 
considered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="778" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;So Mr. Griffith's point well taken and this has been a very 
informative panel. I want to thank all of you and I know there 
have been some differences of opinion. We expected that. In 
fact, we welcome that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="779" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Mr. Griffith's admonitions that there may be solutions that 
you--you are smarter about this stuff than we are by a lot and 
you may have solutions that you can arrive at, not necessarily 
individually but in collaboration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="780" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And I would just submit to you that those solutions may 
well be better than anything we or a federal agency can impose. 
But I guess the other side of that is if we are not moving 
towards some solutions to this problem then there likely will 
be some type of action, perhaps not by this subcommittee this 
year, perhaps not by this subcommittee next year, but there 
will be action taken--whether it be by agency or legislatively.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="781" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Now, Mr. DiLenge, I am going to switch gears a little bit. 
I do want to ask you because some of your written testimony is 
actually fascinating--Mr. Nickels, in his testimony, gave us a 
list of several medications that were very high in price and 
one of them was Keytruda and a drug that was developed for 
malignant melanoma, and the United States president who was 
president when I was in medical school--Jimmy Carter--publicly 
disclosed in July of 2015 that he had metastatic melanoma to 
his liver and his brain. And, of course, I thought the next 
story in that sequence was a state funeral.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="782" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;However, a year later, he's speaking at the Democratic 
Convention. A year ago or a little bit less than a year ago he 
was at President Trump's inauguration. It is a fantastic 
story--that when Jimmy Carter was elected president I was in 
medical school. That story would not have happened.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="783" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Can you speak to that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="784" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt; Yes. It's just one example of so many
incredible miracles. There's no other word for what happened 
with Jimmy Carter.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="785" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; It's a gift. It's a gift.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="786" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;It's a miracle, and that is what the hard men
and women who worked in our companies, and again, let me remind 
you all these are mostly start-up companies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="787" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;They are trying to raise capital every day. I will give you 
one quick story of one of our companies right on the cusp of 
success--started in 2002, has raised $4 billion in public and 
private investment and partnerships with larger companies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="788" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;It spent about $2.5 billion so far in R&amp;amp;D. It is hoping to 
get its first approval of a dramatically important drug next 
year from the FDA, and that's after 15 years, OK, of every day 
working. They've had setbacks. They've had to reduce their 
staffs because it's been hard to raise capital throughout that 
whole time period.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="789" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;    This is the reality of what this body does. When it makes 
public policy it is directly impacting the investment decisions 
that are being made in companies like this one every day--can 
we afford to get that capital, to advance that R&amp;amp;D, to get to 
the next Keytruda. That's exactly what is at stake here.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="790" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And I don't want people to become discouraged
from hearing this from the information that we've gotten in 
this hearing. I am optimistic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="791" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;There have been people in my office just very recently, one 
with a potential gene therapy for a specific type of blindness 
and one with a therapy for hemophilia. Hemophilia, for crying 
out loud.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="792" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;This was never something that I thought when I was in 
training that day we would ever see and it will have a profound 
impact on Mr. Eyles' business because of the ramifications. And 
these individuals also were talking about how do we prepare 
the--whether it's CMS or private insurance--how do we prepare 
the payers for what is in development because, again, I 
consider it a gift to humanity that they are providing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="793" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Yes, there is going to be cost associated with that, with 
one of these therapies that we're talking about it was a one-
time therapy so a lot of research and development costs will 
have to be recouped on that one injection or one treatment--
whatever it is.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="794" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;And I can I just add that, our industry has
been criticized over the years for basically wanting people to 
be addicted to drugs, right, that we just want chronic 
conditions and we don't ever want to cure people, we just want 
to keep them on drugs for the rest of their life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="795" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt;    These new biotech miracles are actually going to cure 
people and a lot of them is maybe one-time injections of gene 
therapy. And that is why when you look at the pricing of those 
it's going to be shocking. Let's be honest about that. But the 
value that they deliver is far beyond those prices.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="796" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; And some of us have urged to allow the things
that are in development--to allow discussions with CMS and 
payers before the FDA approval just because of the----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DiLenge&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="797" speaker="Mr. DiLenge"&gt; Thank you for your work on that, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="798" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Because it is so important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="799" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And Mr. Merritt, you mentioned something in your response 
to a question. I found it intriguing. I've been a big advocate 
of physician drug monitoring programs or prescription drug 
monitoring programs, I guess I should say, the PDMPs. I know 
it's another layer we put on your life, Dr. Harmon. Apologize 
about that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="800" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;But it is useful to know if someone is getting multiple 
prescriptions. But then you alluded to that with the data that 
you have available you can know who is at risk even before they 
might be identified as a risk to themselves or family or their 
physician.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="801" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;So that's pretty powerful information, and I don't know if 
there is a way for you to share with the person who is 
providing the care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="802" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;But I hope we can find a way that your claims data or 
whatever we would call it can actually have a profound 
beneficial impact on what has become a national crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="803" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;So, perhaps we will enter into more discussions about that. 
But that was an intriguing thought that you gave us today and I 
appreciate that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="804" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;So once again, thanks everyone, for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="805" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Mr. Green, did you have any concluding thoughts?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="806" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt; No, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="807" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Anything else to add for the record?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="808" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I want to thank all of you for your testimony and remind

&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;

the record. I ask the witnesses to submit those responses 
within 10 business days of the receipt of those questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="813" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;[Whereupon, at 1:15 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
