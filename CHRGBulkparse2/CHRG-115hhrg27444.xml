    RESEARCH CENTER
    Mr. Cole. Good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome all of 
you to the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, 
and Education for a hearing to discuss the role of facilities 
and administrative costs, sometimes referred to as F&amp;amp;A or 
indirect costs, in supporting NIH-funded research at 
universities and independent research institutions across the 
country.
    Since World War II, the Federal Government and research 
institutions have partnered in a cost-sharing relationship that 
has led to discoveries that have cured diseases and improved 
the quality of life for people around the world. That 
partnership made possible the creation of a biomedical research 
enterprise that has made the U.S. the leader in innovation and 
economic competitiveness.
    We all acknowledge this cost-sharing relationship is valid 
and necessary to maintaining U.S. leadership in research and 
development. But, as stewards of taxpayer dollars, it is our 
responsibility to examine whether the system, as currently 
designed, still works to fairly and efficiently support the 
cost of doing critical research, given the increasing 
complexity of biomedical research today.
    I have expressed great concern with the administration's 
proposal in the fiscal year 2018 budget to cap NIH indirect-
cost reimbursement at 10 percent of total research costs, a 
large reduction from the 28 percent spent by NIH in fiscal year 
2017. Based on many discussions with researchers, 
administrators, and other research funders, both in Oklahoma 
and across the country, I am very concerned that the proposed 
F&amp;amp;A rate cut would drastically reduce the amount and quality of 
research conducted in the United States and that public 
universities would be particularly hard hit.
    We are here today to examine the current policy and 
determine whether there are ways we can make it better, as well 
as whether we can take steps to reduce the administrative 
burden imposed by the Federal Government on research 
institutions and scientists so that researchers can spend more 
time doing research and less time doing paperwork.
    We are fortunate to have four outstanding witnesses from 
universities and independent research institutions to help us 
understand these issues today.
    First, Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier is the vice president of 
research, regents' professor of meteorology, Weathernews Chair 
Emeritus, and Teigen Presidential Professor at the University 
of Oklahoma. He is serving his second 6-year term on the 
National Science Board, the last 4 years of which he served as 
Vice Chairman, and was appointed this year by Governor Mary 
Fallin as Oklahoma's fourth Secretary of Science and 
Technology, and, for the record, my very good friend and very 
wise counselor.
    Dr. Keith Yamamoto is a professor of cellular and molecular 
pharmacology at the University of California, San Francisco, 
and is UCSF's first vice chancellor for science, policy, and 
strategy. He chairs the Coalition for Life Sciences and sits on 
the National Research Council Governing Board Executive 
Committee and serves as vice chair of the National Academy of 
Medicine's Executive Committee and Council.
    Dr. Bruce Liang is an internationally recognized

    As a reminder to everyone, we will abide by the 5-minute 
rule so that we will be able to keep closely to the schedule we 
outlined for members and participants.
    Before we begin, I would like to turn to my ranking member, 
the gentlelady from Connecticut, for any remarks she cares to 
make.
    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    And let me welcome our expert panel this morning. And what 
a distinguished group of doctors, all. But I want to point out 
that UConn is not only for known for its great basketball team 
but for its outstanding scholarship, as well.
    Welcome, Dr. Liang.
    I want to say a thank you to all of you for being here 
today to share your perspective on indirect costs associated 
with biomedical research. The talent on your side of the table 
cannot be overstated, and the research at your institutions 
represents the power to do so much good for more people than 
almost anything else within the purview of government.
    The issue of indirect costs gets to the heart of the 
Federal Government's role in basic research. As a community, we 
have determined that basic research should be fully supported 
by the Federal Government, that the government should pay for 
the true cost of research, which includes both direct and 
indirect costs. Both components are necessary to fund world-
class research programs like the ones that are represented by 
our panelists this morning. I should note that this has been a 
guiding principle behind Federal funding for research for 
decades.
    Why do we, as a government, commit to funding the true 
costs of research? Because basic research benefits the common 
good. It creates knowledge, improves our understanding of 
biology, health, and medicine, and advances treatments and 
cures for many of the diseases that affect millions of people. 
It improves our quality of life. It saves lives. And, as a 
survivor of ovarian cancer, this is very personal to me.
    Basic research is the building block of scientific 
knowledge. We all know that. The private sector will step in 
once research can be translated into commercially viable 
products. However, if it is not for the federally funded basic 
research, we would never reach that point.
    The term ``indirect costs'' is a bit of a misnomer. 
Indirect costs include research facilities' daily operations 
and maintenance and program administration, to name a few. In 
short, indirect costs are necessary to support world-class 
research.
    Unfortunately--well, let me just say, as Tony DeCrappeo, 
president of the Council on Government Relations, observed, 
quote, ``If all you are concerned about is the direct costs, it 
won't take long for your facilities to deteriorate. You can't 
do research on the quad.''
    Unfortunately--and the Chairman alluded to this--the 
administration thinks that research can be done on the cheap, 
and the budget shortsightedly proposed a cut of $7,500,000,000 
below NIH's current funding level. And once there was a 
realization that the proposal to cut NIH research was 
unpopular, it is my view that there was a surge for 
justification for a proposed cut, and that worked its way back 
to settling on indirect costs.
    And, again, in my view, I believe that the administration's 
rigid cap of 10 percent for indirect costs would have a 
chilling impact on research. My colleagues on the committee 
have heard me say it many times, but it bears repeating: You 
cannot do more with less. You can only do less with less.
    So I reject the administration's proposal to reduce our 
investment in NIH research. I appreciate Chairman Cole's 
efforts to work in a bipartisan fashion to include language in 
the House bill and in the short-term CR to block this 
shortsighted proposal.
    Now, I understand that there are concerns, including 
concerns from some NIH-funded researchers, about the share of 
research dollars that are allocated to facilities, 
administration, and related costs. So I am eager to hear from 
our panel as you address these often-heard critiques.
    I will take one second to--it is going to be a few more 
seconds--to remind us that, while the NIH is now funded at 
$34,100,000,000 thanks to two consecutive $2,000,000,000 
increases, funding has not kept pace with the rising costs of 
biomedical research. In fact, NIH's budget has declined by 
nearly $6,500,000,000 since 2003 when you adjust for inflation.
    Sixteen years ago, NIH funded about one in three 
meritorious research proposals. Today, the rate has fallen to 
about one in five. Thereby we miss opportunities to work toward 
cures for life-altering diseases that affect far too many 
people.
    The unfunded grants translate to medical discoveries not 
being made and lives not being saved. We choose to hamper our 
progress as a Nation. I wonder, if you add a cap to indirect 
costs on top of this decline in opportunity, how does that 
impact your ability to carry on?
    I have introduced the bipartisan Accelerating Biomedical 
Research Act, which would reverse the devastating funding cuts 
to the NIH and provide stable, predictable growth for years to 
come. It would untie the hands of the committee, allow us to go 
above the caps--the same mechanism that we use for healthcare 
fraud and abuse. This would set us, in my view, on a path to 
doubling the NIH budget.
    I am hopeful that this year we will be able to provide 
another increase in $2,000,000,000 for NIH research--I know the 
chairman feels absolutely the same way--if we have a bipartisan 
agreement to raise the discretionary funding cap.
    Thank you again to our panel. We look forward to hearing 
from each of you and getting a better understanding of the true 
cost of basic research, including both direct and indirect 
costs.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Cole. I thank the gentlelady.
    And we are privileged this morning to be joined by the 
ranking member of the full committee. And, of course, in that 
capacity, she is a member of every subcommittee, but I know we 
are her favorite because she is always here.
    So I want to recognize the gentlelady from New York for any 
remarks she cares to make.
    Mrs. Lowey. Well, I would like to thank Chairman Cole and 
Ranking Member DeLauro. And because I always want to be here, I 
will be very brief. And I apologize to the panelists in advance 
that I cannot stay, but I certainly support everything that is 
in your briefs, and I thank you for submitting them.
    And I really do appreciate, Mr. Chairman, that we have such 
distinguished panelists to share their views with us this 
morning.
    I was extremely troubled, which is the understatement, by 
the administration's budget request to not only make a dramatic 
$7,500,000,000 cut to the NIH but, in particular, to slash 
funding for research facilities that host NIH grantees and pay 
for things as basic as keeping the lights on.
    Universities, hospitals, and other research centers in my 
district and throughout the country have appropriately raised 
alarms that this cut would significantly harm an institution's 
ability to fund biomedical research. We cannot afford to let 
that happen.
    While I do not share the chairman's support for the fiscal 
year 2018 appropriations bill--I should say, his public support 
for the fiscal year 2018--I don't want to get the chairman into 
difficulty here.
    Mr. Cole. Really.
    Ms. DeLauro. We have been careful.
    Mrs. Lowey. I truly recognize his work and the work of all 
those on this subcommittee to increase funding at the NIH by 
$1,100,000,000 and include language prohibiting HHS from 
changing the rates on facilities and administrative costs.
    If the HHS decides to move unilaterally to cap funds to 
research facilities, it would be catastrophic for biomedical 
research in our country, would prevent future scientists from 
obtaining NIH grants. A unilateral move by HHS would also be 
alarming, as it directly opposes congressional intent.
    So today's hearing will be helpful in discussing what 
reforms may and may not be needed. And, hopefully, your message 
will provide the administration with the knowledge necessary to 
make a more informed budget request next year.
    So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Cole. Always a pleasure to have the gentlelady.
    Before I turn it over to the first of our witnesses, at my 
request, Dr. Droegemeier has provided a comprehensive and 
informative paper on the history of the Federal Government's 
role in partnering with universities to support research and 
the role of F&amp;amp;A cost reimbursement in supporting this research.
    I think this paper is really exceptional, quite frankly. 
Just thank you. It brings a lot of things together in a single 
place. And I would highly recommend it as a resource for our 
members and would ask unanimous consent that we be able to 
enter it in full in the record.
    Ms. DeLauro. Absolutely.
    Mr. Cole. Without objection.
    Mr. Cole. Okay. Now I would like to recognize the first of 
our four witnesses.
    Dr. Droegemeier, you are up.
    Mr. Droegemeier. Thank you very much, Chairman Cole, 
Ranking Member DeLauro, and members of the subcommittee. It is 
my privilege to testify before you today. I am testifying as an 
academic researcher, an administrator, a teacher, and also an 
adviser on matters of science and technology policy.
    I just wish to make four brief points today in my 
testimony.
    The first point is that, to understand any proposed changes 
in F&amp;amp;A, we really need to start not with budgets but, rather, 
with a history of how the current research enterprise came to 
be.
    In the 1930s, virtually all research in higher education 
was funded either by philanthropy or by private foundations, 
not by the Federal Government. You may find it surprising that 
most institutions at that time had no interest, in fact, in 
receiving Federal funds for research, owing to fears about 
government intrusion.
    But then, by 1939, President Roosevelt began mobilizing the 
Nation for war. Vannevar Bush, who would go on to write the 
manifesto that led to creation of the National Science 
Foundation, was put in charge by President Roosevelt to fund 
academic institutions, to fund research.
    Taking into account the financial interests and idealogical 
values of universities, Bush established a funding model in 
which indirect costs would be fully reimbursed at a rate of 50 
percent, a flat rate, which is one-half of that being charged 
by industry.
    That moment really marked the beginning of the academic-
government research partnership that we enjoy today. And I 
think we all know how important universities were in our 
victory in World War II.
    Now, from 1950 to 1966, various caps were instituted on 
indirect-cost rates for grants, which halted the previous 
practice of full reimbursement. In 1966, however, those caps 
were removed, but a new requirement of cost-sharing--that is, 
mandatory cost-sharing--was added so that higher education 
would formally assume some of the financial risk. And, also, 
those caps were put in place to help stretch Federal dollars.
    To that point, which is my second point, four specific 
types of cost-sharing are important today and are linked to the 
F&amp;amp;A issue.
    The first form is that mandated by agencies or by States or 
offered voluntarily by institutions. In fiscal 2015, U.S. 
universities paid $1,300,000,000 in cost-sharing.
    The second form of cost-sharing concerns the unrecovery of 
F&amp;amp;A. In fiscal year 2015, U.S. colleges and universities did 
not recover $4,860,000,000, or in other words 30 percent, of 
the F&amp;amp;A they were allowed by law to receive. This under-
recovery results from agencies that limit F&amp;amp;A on certain 
programs, from other organizations that charge no or reduced 
F&amp;amp;A, including State governments. And it also results from a 
26-year-long cap on the administrative component, the ``A'' 
component of F&amp;amp;A.
    The third form of cost-sharing involves the use of 
university funds themselves. In fiscal year 2015, this 
represented 24 percent of all R&amp;amp;D funds expended by higher 
education, or $16,800,000,000. And that number has been growing 
steadily for the past 20 years, which is now really approaching 
a point of unsustainability. This money goes toward funding 
unfunded compliance mandates, which total around 100 today 
compared to just a few 25 years ago.
    The final form of cost-sharing lies in the fact that the 
F&amp;amp;A negotiated rate with the Federal Government is, in fact, 
lower than it should be based upon institutional analyses, 
which is also due in part to the cap that is placed on the A 
rate. At my own campus, the negotiated rate of 55 percent is 
notably less than the 61.6 percent that the rate should 
actually be.
    Also, at my campus, looking at the actual recovery rate 
that we achieve based on money we actually bring in, the F&amp;amp;A 
rate is only 33 percent, which means that my institution puts 
22 cents for every dollar that it brings in on the table to 
bring in that research dollar.
    My third point concerns the growth in F&amp;amp;A. Over the past 10 
years, the average growth has been only 0.8 percent per year 
for research universities, even though administrative costs 
have grown dramatically during this time. For NIH research 
project grants from 1998 through 2014, the ratio of F&amp;amp;A to 
total project costs was nearly constant at slightly more than 
30 percent. And it was constant for nearly 20 years.
    My fourth and final point concerns implications of capping 
the NIH F&amp;amp;A rate at 10 percent. The proposed cap would decrease 
F&amp;amp;A from $4,600,000,000 to roughly $1,900,000,000. If this 
money were removed entirely from the NIH budget, the same 
amount or, possibly, likely, somewhat less research would be 
performed, but--and I really want to stress this point--only 
institutions that have sufficient resources to make up that 
loss in F&amp;amp;A or a substantial fraction of it would be able to 
accept the funding. And, ultimately, eventually, those 
universities also would be unable to make up that loss. The 
U.S. would therefore see diminished involvement in research by 
perhaps hundreds of universities and would have other profound 
implications.
    Now, if, on the other hand, that saved F&amp;amp;A went to the 
direct-cost category, more research would be funded in direct 
costs. But, again, only those institutions having sufficient 
resources would be able to play. Those institutions that have 
resources that aren't sufficient to make up the lost F&amp;amp;A would 
be left out entirely or have greatly diminished activities.
    Addressing today's health challenges requires an all-hands-
on-deck participation of every researcher in every corner of 
the Nation. The risks associated with making what might seem 
like minor changes to the highly successful but tenuous 
academic-government partnership for purposes of financial 
expediency have profound consequences for our Nation and must 
be carefully weighed.
    Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment, and I 
look forward to your questions.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Cole. Thank you very much.
    Dr. Yamamoto, you are recognized for any comments you care 
to make.
    Mr. Yamamoto. Good morning, Chairman Cole, Ranking Member 
DeLauro, members and staff of this esteemed subcommittee. I am 
Keith Yamamoto, vice chancellor for science policy and strategy 
and an NIH-funded molecular biologist at the University of 
California, San Francisco.
    The topic today, the role of facilities and administrative 
costs, F&amp;amp;A, in supporting NIH-funded research, bears centrally 
on the remarkable compact between the Federal Government and 
the Nation's research enterprise that Dr. Droegemeier referred 
to. This compact was launched over 70 years ago when Vannevar 
Bush urged the Federal Government to greatly expand the crucial 
link it had established with scientists during World War II.
    Dr. Bush addressed science broadly but singled out the, 
quote, ``war on disease,'' close quote, noting that, quote, 
``if we are to maintain progress in medicine, the government 
should extend financial support to basic biomedical research in 
the medical schools and universities.''
    What evolved is a Federal academic cost-sharing grant-in-
aid agreement. By awarding my lab an NIH grant, the government 
helps to pay for my proposed experiments and a portion of 
infrastructure, the F&amp;amp;A, needed for those experiments.
    This partnership aids both government and academia, 
compared especially to another concept that was under 
consideration at the time, which was for the government to 
construct, maintain, and populate a vast network of Federal 
laboratories. And the cost-sharing is genuine. Universities and 
research institutes are the second-largest funders of 
biomedical research, behind only NIH.
    Let me make three quick points about that F&amp;amp;A matter.
    First, the separation of research costs into direct and F&amp;amp;A 
is a rational accounting strategy. Direct funding partially 
covers the experiments in my lab, whereas F&amp;amp;A funding helps to 
support the resources at UCSF, without which those experiments 
could not be done: lights, water, information technology, my 
sophisticated laboratory building, security, staff to ensure 
responsible stewardship of the grant funds and compliance with 
Federal regulations and guidelines and the like. Such costs are 
better accounted for in aggregate, covering all of the NIH-
funded research at UCSF, compared, for example, to installing 
separate water and electricity meters in every laboratory. But, 
like direct costs, F&amp;amp;A costs are essential to the research.
    Second point: The F&amp;amp;A rate determination is rigorous and 
institution-specific--institution-specific--and, thus, very 
complex.
    Funding decisions for direct costs are made by expert 
scientific peer-review panels. Only one application in five is 
funded. F&amp;amp;A support is then awarded as a percentage of direct 
support that is negotiated for each institution, with, in our 
case, the HHS auditors. In addition, there are predefined caps 
on F&amp;amp;A for certain types of grants and for administrative 
costs.
    All of this complexity produces complicated outcomes--
different F&amp;amp;A reimbursement rates for different institutions, 
always well below the actual cost but still very different. And 
with few stakeholders truly understanding the complexities, 
including even some Members of Congress who are strong 
advocates for the NIH and certainly including some faculty, as 
Ms. DeLauro said--I used to be among those who thought, ``Well, 
the F&amp;amp;A costs are just money that I got by winning this grant. 
The money should come to me.''
    Third point: The rate basis for F&amp;amp;A reimbursement differs 
between the Federal Government and various philanthropic 
institutions, so the rates are not directly comparable. For 
example, the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation counts facilities, 
utilities, and communications as direct costs, whereas NIH does 
not.
    A recent study showed that if a government and 
philanthropic organization's F&amp;amp;A rates were compared on the 
same basis then they would not be different. At UCSF, we have 
done that calculation, so we have recalculated the F&amp;amp;A costs 
using NIH criteria for the $138,000,000 in Gates funding 
received between 2013 and 2017 and found that the rate 
approximates that for Federal grants.
    Like all complicated procedures and policies, the F&amp;amp;A 
reimbursement process is not perfect. It merits periodic 
evaluation. And I might submit to you that a congressionally 
mandated analysis and assessment by the Natural Academy of 
Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine could serve the 
process very well.
    However, draconian cuts or caps would damage research, 
researchers, research outcomes, American health, and American 
competitiveness. If the Federal Government adopted OMB's F&amp;amp;A 
cap, our large enterprise at UCSF would suddenly be short 
$120,000,000, with no way--no way--to make up the deficit. 
Instead, we would have to decide which research and health 
programs, which training programs, which facilities are going 
to be maintained, which would be cut back, which would be 
closed.
    And make no mistake that smaller institutions that are 
actively, vigorously building up their biomedical research 
enterprises--it could lead to total shutdown of those efforts 
that are so vital to their regions and their congressional 
districts.
    Clearly, NIH F&amp;amp;A is an important matter with big 
ramifications, so let me thank the subcommittee for dedicating 
your time to learn about it and evaluate its merits and 
impacts.
    This concludes my testimony. I would be happy to respond to 
your questions.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Cole. Thank you very much.
    Dr. Liang, you are recognized now for your opening 
statement.
    Dr. Liang. Chairman Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro, and 
subcommittee members, I thank you for the opportunity to 
testify today before this subcommittee regarding the 
administration proposal to drastically reduce and cap the 
reimbursement of F&amp;amp;A costs to academic research institutions.
    My name is Bruce Liang. I am the dean of the UConn School 
of Medicine and also a practicing cardiologist in Farmington, 
Connecticut.
    I also want to begin by thanking the subcommittee for 
acting on July 13th to soundly reject this attempt to reduce 
the costs associated with cutting-edge medical research and for 
its bold and bipartisan proposal to actually increase the 
Nation's investment in NIH by $1,100,000,000 in fiscal year 
2018.
    A 10-percent cap on the F`A rate would weaken our ability 
to innovate and to develop new medicine and cures, would shut 
down research programs, and would also in Connecticut adversely 
affect biotechnology innovation by UConn, by Jackson Laboratory 
for Genomic Medicine, which is located in Farmington, 
Connecticut, the Mount Sinai Genomic Research Center in 
Branford, Connecticut, and Yale and New Haven's growing 
bioscience businesses, as well as academic institutions such as 
those associated with AAMC, APLU, and AAU.
    As you know, F&amp;amp;A costs are the shared expenses related to 
buildings and use of research facilities and the administrative 
backbone functions that make such places run. F&amp;amp;A 
reimbursements pay for building depreciation and maintenance, 
academic library materials, shared research equipment, 
departmental administration office supplies, and grant 
oversight activities, such as pre-award application and, 
hopefully, post-award work--not very exciting stuff but 
absolutely critical funding to keep academic medical centers 
and research institutions operating in an efficient manner.
    The F&amp;amp;A reimbursement for costs incurred by academic 
institutions is tightly regulated and audited by the Federal 
Government, and the methodology for negotiating indirect costs 
has been in place since 1965. The rates have remained largely 
stable across NIH grantees for a number of decades.
    The administrative component of the Federal F&amp;amp;A is capped 
at 26 percent, despite the fact, as we heard earlier, that the 
actual costs to administer grants substantially exceeds the 26-
percent recovery. So, again, these are shared costs. The work 
associated with F&amp;amp;A rate setting and reporting is minor and is 
far outweighed by the critical importance of F&amp;amp;A reimbursement 
to universities and research institutions.
    The F&amp;amp;A dollars are needed to support the real costs of 
doing research, without which universities would need to rely 
on other sources of funding, such as tuition dollars or 
philanthropy. Reallocating these costs to other funding sources 
would have a detrimental impact on not only the student support 
but universities' ability to recruit highly talented students 
and faculty. Do we really want to raise tuition to compensate 
for a capped F&amp;amp;A rate and discourage talented individuals 
because of their concern for greater indebtedness or divert 
resources away from supporting a promising young physician 
scientist?
    And like a boat crew using all oars to propel us forward as 
the leader in the world, every supporter, including Federal 
Government, States, universities, and private donors and 
nonprofit foundations, all must continue to share the load.
    I want to close on a point that might be overlooked when 
debating about the minutia of facilities and administrative 
costs, which also speaks to my experience helping teach the 
next generation of academic researchers. Without Federal 
support that shares with the States and the universities the 
cost of building the innovative cardiology and genomic research 
centers we have at UConn, we cannot attract great scientists, 
like Dr. Travis Hinson, who studies the genetics of disease of 
the heart muscle that can lead to early heart failure, or Dr. 
Se-Jin Lee, who has elucidated a new protein target to treat 
frailty.
    These investigators are just some of the innovators who 
have attracted talented students to work with them and are the 
true beneficiary of Federal F&amp;amp;A reimbursement. And they are the 
future of medical discovery and innovation in this country.
    Again, I thank the subcommittee for the opportunity to 
testify. I am happy to answer any questions.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Cole. Thank you very much.
    Before we move to Dr. Gilliland--actually, he is a 
constituent of one of our members of this committee, and Ms. 
Herrera Beutler, I think, requested the opportunity to formally 
introduce him to the group.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. I thank the chairman.
    I really am excited to be a part of and hear this testimony 
and to introduce someone who we are very proud of, Dr. Gary 
Gilliland, president and director of the Fred--I was going to 
say the ``Fred Hutch,'' the slang--Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center from Washington State, who is going to be 
sharing with us today.
    We are really proud of this global-leading institution that 
is at the center of life sciences research in our community in 
Washington State. As many of you know, Fred Hutchinson has been 
at the forefront of disease research since being founded in 
1975. And they are known--really, they are world-renowned for 
their cutting-edge work in the elimination of cancer and 
related diseases, particularly with bone marrow transplants and 
immunotherapy.
    And as a researcher and clinician specializing in blood 
cancers, Dr. Gilliland has made major contributions to the 
understanding of the genetic basis of blood diseases, 
particularly leukemia. And in addition to his own research on 
personalized cancer treatments, Dr. Gilliland has successfully 
led to a breakthrough immunotherapy drug--has led it to market 
at Merck and has spearheaded a new model for personalized 
medicine at the University of Pennsylvania system.
    So Dr. Gilliland has earned a Ph.D. in microbiology from 
the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1980 and a 
medical degree from the University of California, San 
Francisco, in 1984.
    And before coming to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center, the Fred Hutch, in 2015, Dr. Gilliland has held 
numerous clinical research and leadership titles, including 
professor at Harvard Medical School, director of the leukemia 
program at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, senior vice 
president and global oncology franchise head at Merck &amp;amp; 
Company, and the vice dean of the Perelman School of Medicine 
at the University of Pennsylvania.
    He has also had many awards and honors that are really too 
numerous to list here today.
    Dr. Gilliland and Fred Hutch also provide inspiration and 
hope for everyone fighting their own battle with cancer. And we 
are very grateful for your work and look forward to supporting 
you in your efforts to find curative therapies for cancer.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Cole. Thank you very much.
    Pretty great introduction there.
    Dr. Gilliland. That was great.
    Mr. Cole. Dr. Gilliland, you are recognized for your 
opening statement.
    Dr. Gilliland. Well, thank you, Congresswoman, for that 
very kind introduction. I am very grateful.
    Chairman Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro, and members of the 
committee, thank you for inviting me to testify this morning.
    At the Fred Hutch, our mission is to eliminate cancer and 
related diseases as causes of human suffering and death. As 
noted, we were founded in 1975. Today, we have more than 3,000 
employees. We occupy 1.3 million square feet. We run over 400 
clinical trials each year.
    Our breakthrough discoveries began with Dr. Don Thomas' 
pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation, which has 
boosted survival rates for certain blood cancers from zero to 
90 percent. Dr. Thomas' work earned a Nobel Prize in 1990 and 
led to the potentially lifesaving option to treat more than a 
million people worldwide.
    Though originally developed for leukemia patients, this 
procedure is now used to treat more than 50 different diseases, 
including autoimmune disease, sickle-cell anemia, 
myelodysplastic syndromes, inherited immune system disorders, 
and metabolic disorders.
    The development of bone marrow transplantation also 
provided the first definitive and reproducible proof of the 
human's immune system's ability to cure cancer. Today our 
researchers continue to refine these approaches, which harness 
the power of our own immune cells and molecules to eliminate 
cancer, through a world-leading immunotherapy program. And this 
is just one of our areas of focus.
    NIH funding drives scientific innovation at research 
organizations across the country, including the Fred Hutch, and 
I am proud that the results of our exceptional science also 
demonstrate excellent stewardship of NIH funding. Our research 
has led to dramatic returns on the Federal taxpayers' 
investment, both in dollars and in lives saved.
    For example, one study of the Fred Hutch-based Women's 
Health Initiative led to discoveries that have helped prevent 
up to 20,000 cases of breast cancer each year and yielded a net 
economic return of $37,100,000,000 over 10 years, which is a 
return of approximately $140 on every dollar that was invested 
in the trial. And just this year, Fred Hutch research found 
that for the $418,000,000 in NCI-funded Southwestern Oncology 
Group clinical trials, cancer patients in the U.S. have gained 
3.34 million years of life.
    As the committee knows, NIH grants include both direct 
costs and indirect costs. By Federal law and regulation, quote, 
``Direct costs are those costs that can be identified 
specifically with a particular sponsored project relatively 
easily with a high degree of accuracy and can include supplies, 
certain equipment, researcher salary support.''
    In contrast, indirect costs are those that benefit multiple 
research projects, so we are not easily tied to just one 
project. These include sophisticated environmental controls, 
compliance with State, local, and Federal regulations, and even 
equipment and space rental costs. They efficiently enable us to 
protect research participants' safety and privacy, report the 
results of publicly funded research, safely use and dispose of 
potentially hazardous research chemicals and biomaterials, and 
to store and process and analyze very complex data sets.
    Together, direct and indirect costs represent the true 
total cost of research. Indirect funds are not, as some have 
said, quote, ``money that goes for something other than 
research.'' And an institution's indirect cost is completely 
unrelated to its administrative efficiency. It is one method of 
accounting, with formulas that are created by the Office of 
Management and Budget and set by each research center's 
cognizant agency.
    At the Fred Hutch, following generally accepted accounting 
principles for nonprofit organizations results in a general and 
administrative cost rate of approximately 12 percent of our 
total costs.
    At Fred Hutch, our sole focus is research that saves lives. 
So every dollar, direct and indirect, funds research. Patient 
outcomes cannot be improved without funding the true total cost 
of research. This includes shared scientific resources and 
resources that enable us, for example, to generate therapeutic 
T cells for immunotherapy trials, analyze and protect patients' 
genomic data, provide support for exploratory pilot projects.
    By supporting experts and equipment that no single project 
or lab could supply on its own, shared resources, as one 
example, save money, and they drive team science that 
accelerates the translation of bench science into tomorrow's 
bedside cures.
    Two years ago, I pledged that we should have curative 
therapies for most, if not all, cancers by 2025, and I stand by 
that. Advances in bioscience, technology, and data science have 
brought us to this inflection point. This is not a time to pull 
back; this is a time to double down. The choice to invest fully 
in biomedical research is an investment in a healthy, thriving 
Nation.
    Thank you.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Cole. Thank you.
    I think Ms. Herrera Beutler had a quick point.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. Quick clarification. Please forgive 
me. It is ``Gilliland.'' I am having such a hard time with J's 
and G's. This is my first cup of coffee.
    Dr. Gilliland. I can't say my own name in the morning, so 
you did very well.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. Thank you.
    Mr. Cole. Well, thank you all again very much for your 
testimony, and let me start with the questioning. And I have a 
question that, really, I would pose to each of you, just 
sequentially, starting with Dr. Droegemeier.
    How would your institution react if the administration's 
proposal to cap indirect-cost reimbursement at 10 percent of 
total costs were actually enacted? Would your institution 
continue to apply for the same number and types of grants, or 
would your institution do less to cover its increased share of 
the administrative costs?
    I am sure each of you would have a different strategy, 
depending on your position, frankly, financially, as to how you 
would approach this, but I am curious what the range of 
responses might be.
    Mr. Droegemeier. Thank you, Chairman Cole.
    At our health sciences center campus in Oklahoma City, a 
10-percent cap would result in the loss of about $11,000,000 of 
F&amp;amp;A for the last fiscal year, fiscal year 2016. On the Norman 
campus, where we actually do NIH-funded research, we would lose 
a significant amount, probably about $7,000,000 or so, over 
about a 3-year period.
    How we would respond to that would be that we would have to 
shut down some labs. We would have to pull back in terms of 
hiring students. We would have to scale back our research, 
ultimately, because we don't have the resources to make up 
those lost F&amp;amp;A costs.
    And I think that is true for a lot of the universities in 
the Midwest that share our same structure, where we don't have 
large research endowments, we don't have resources that are 
gifts and things like that that are already predetermined--the 
use is predetermined. So they are not fungible, flexible money 
that we could apply there. I think we are very loathe to raise 
tuition costs, so we would not balance the books on the backs 
of our students. So we would have to scale back our research.
    And, also, the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, 
likewise, told me that about $25,000,000 a year would be 
impacted by this cap, which would translate into about a 
$100,000,000 loss of research.
    So we would have to scale back because we just don't have 
the financial resources, including at the State budget. 
Chairman, you know that our State budget is very challenged 
right now. So we couldn't look to the State or to private 
resources very effectively to raise the cost to make up the 
lost F&amp;amp;A.
    Mr. Cole. Thank you.
    Dr. Yamamoto.
    Mr. Yamamoto. I would echo those comments. In fact, you 
have in front of you three representatives of State public 
institutions, and Dr. Droegemeier's comments are really, I am 
sure, true for all of us.
    We have a large research enterprise. The UCSF has four 
professional schools, are number one in NIH funding in the 
country, have been for the last 3 years running. So there is 
lots of resources there, and you might think, ``Oh, well, 
everything is going to be okay.'' As I mentioned in my 
testimony, the consequence of pulling back to a 10-percent cap 
would be a $120,000,000 shortfall in 1 year. We don't actually 
have that money sitting around in the backyard.
    And so the consequence would be to pull back on 
maintenance, building facilities, being able to maintain them, 
being able to acquire and utilize sophisticated research 
instrumentation, training, and research programs that are 
making a real impact on health. And so that would be the 
consequence.
    It has been said by some colleagues of mine on faculties 
that this would be a great thing because it would open up more 
money for research. But, in fact, that is not the case, because 
the indirect costs of the F&amp;amp;A has to be covered in some way, 
one way or another. And we really don't have a choice for that. 
And so, in fact, it would not benefit new investigators coming 
into the fold. They would not be hired.
    So there is really--it is not an equal matter of being able 
to move money around back and forth. It is just this constant 
pool that we need to deal with. And the consequences would be 
dire for our institution as well as for these others.
    Mr. Cole. Dr. Liang.
    Dr. Liang. In 2016, UConn's total research enterprise 
totaled about $260,000,000, which included about $40,000,000 of 
F&amp;amp;A support from the Federal agencies, including the NIH. So, 
if the F&amp;amp;A were to be capped at 10 percent, we would lose most 
of that $40,000,000.
    And so then the question is, what alternative sources of 
funding could there be? Well, tuition and fees is an important 
part of it, but, being the State's flagship public university, 
we try to keep the tuition and fees down to attract 
outstanding, talented students from Connecticut, also from 
outside Connecticut as well, and we would be forced to raise 
tuition and fees. And, even then, it would not go anywhere near 
to cover the shortfall if the F&amp;amp;A cost is capped at 10 percent.
    And the other source would be philanthropy and donations, 
but, as we know, many of the donations have stipulations. We 
would have to comply with philanthropists' wishes in terms of 
how the funds are expended, and so it really cannot be diverted 
to cover the F&amp;amp;A costs, such as building maintenance.
    And so the end result would be that we have to close down 
research programs, and not only that we cannot innovate and 
stimulate and support young, promising scientists, we have to 
actually shut down some of the research programs. So it would 
be devastating for us.
    Mr. Cole. I have gone over my time, but, with the consent 
of the ranking member, I certainly want to give you, Dr. 
Gilliland, an opportunity to respond as well.
    Dr. Gilliland. Well, thank you, Chairman.
    We are the top NIH-funded research institute in the 
country. We have been since 1992. The impact on the Hutch would 
be calamitous. We have 82 percent of our support that comes 
from the NIH. This 10-percent cap would represent a $60,000,000 
operating loss for us. And the consequence of that is that we 
simply would not be able to accept the same number of NIH 
grants that we do now. We compete pretty effectively for those 
one in five, but we could not move that forward.
    And, Mr. Chairman, the tragedy around that is not that we 
would lose labs or we would close down labs or we would lose 
scientists. The tragedy is that people will die from cancer 
because we are not able to advance our work at a time when we 
are at an inflection point where we have potentially curative 
approaches.
    There are people who have died of cancer while we are 
having this hearing. That is a very important sense of urgency. 
And we will get there someday, but it would slow us down, and 
people will sacrifice their lives as a consequence of that.
    Mr. Cole. Thank you.
    I want to thank my friend for the indulgence, and we will 
now move to the ranking member for her questions.
    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very much.
    And just to say, this is about saving lives, you know, and 
this is where our opportunity is.
    Let me just--and I want to do something similar. That was 
going to be my first question, but let me get to what is my 
second question, which includes all of you.
    The topic of indirect costs is a discussion about the true 
cost of research and whether the Federal Government is, in 
fact, covering the true cost of that research. So I am going to 
ultimately get to all four of you on this, but, Dr. Yamamoto, 
your testimony notes that, at UCSF, you estimated your indirect 
costs in 2016, $253,000,000. You were reimbursed $160,000,000.
    Dr. Droegemeier, your testimony was that unrecovered 
indirect costs at the University of Oklahoma's Norman campus is 
averaged at $17,500,000 per year from 2011 to 2015. You also 
note that the campus recovered about 52 percent of its indirect 
costs, while the university picked up the tab for the remaining 
48 percent.
    So, ultimately, as I say, I want to get all four of you to 
answer this. But, Dr. Yamamoto and Dr. Droegemeier, I would be 
interested about a further explanation of the discrepancy 
between your estimated indirect costs, the amount that is 
reimbursed by the NIH. How do you fill the gap?
    And I would like to ask that same question of both Dr. 
Liang and Dr. Gillibrand--Gilliland. Gillibrand is my colleague 
in the Senate, so we have all kinds of things happening here 
today.
    Dr. Gilliland. Almost anything.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. It is ``gill''----
    Ms. DeLauro. Gill.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler [continuing]. Like a fish gill, for the 
record.
    Dr. Gilliland. Fish gill. That is good. Okay.
    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you.
    Mr. Yamamoto. Thank you for that question. Maybe we should 
start calling him Jerry Gilliland.
    So the shortfall, we have to make it up. So the discrepancy 
comes from----
    Ms. DeLauro. Could you talk about the discrepancy?
    Mr. Yamamoto. So the discrepancy comes from two sources.
    One is the outcomes of these negotiations that we go 
through every 3 to 5 years with HHS. It is really hand-to-hand 
combat. It is, line by line, moving through the budgets, where 
the money is coming from that is actually going to NIH-funded 
investigators, not just other scientists or clinicians at UCSF. 
And so that process sort of keeps everyone on track. It is just 
a way to prevent problems, fraud or other kinds of abuse, 
because those things come up every 3 to 5 years and we have to 
take it through.
    When we do that, then it is a negotiation with the 
auditors. And they allow certain amounts, sometimes--always 
less than what we think would be justified and always, as you 
said, resulting in a big shortfall that has to be covered in 
some way. So that is one source of the discrepancy.
    The other is, as Dr. Droegemeier said, that decades ago--I 
guess it was 1991--NIH installed a cap on the amount of 
indirect costs for certain kinds of grants and certain kinds of 
activities. Administrative costs capped at 26 percent, as we 
have heard. Again, a big shortfall. And there is just nothing 
we can do about that. That is not even up for negotiation.
    So, in order to keep the enterprise functioning, we need to 
make up the shortfall. It used to be that we could draw on 
State funds and State support. That is no longer true. UCSF 
doesn't have undergraduates, so even if we were to take this 
dramatic step of increasing tuition, we would have no impact on 
the operating budget at UCSF.
    And so it is really through philanthropy and pulling 
together other sorts of funds and endowments that can be 
liberated for activities like this that we are able to cover 
those costs. We know that is the case, and we are able to do it 
now with the negotiated rate that we have. But if there would 
be this draconian cut, then we would be short, as I said, 
$120,000,000 each year.
    Mr. Droegemeier. I would agree with that. I think, as time 
has gone on, you know, we have learned to deal with some of 
these things. It has sort of been creeping along and growing 
up, but if you look at the 24 percent of funding that now 
universities put on the table, almost one-quarter of all the 
funding that they expand every year is from their own money. We 
heard the Fred Hutch Center, you know, a very substantial 
amount of money, compared to NIH money coming in. So that, I 
think, is really, you know, a very, very big problem.
    I think the other thing is the fact that we--my campus, we 
basically only recover half of the F&amp;amp;A, essentially, that we 
are due. And so we have made up that funding in other ways. We 
have scrimped and saved and stuff, but we have also stopped 
providing faculty agreements to cost-share. Even if it is 
required by the agency, we basically say, ``No, we can't do 
that.'' Major equipment proposals that have a 30-percent 
mandated cost-sharing by the Federal Government, sometimes we 
say, ``You know what? We can't do that. We can't afford to be 
successful because we can't pay the cost of bringing that in.''
    So it is not just the F&amp;amp;A rate; it is also the cost-
sharing. When that all piles on together, essentially what 
universities have to do, they have to say, you know, ``We can't 
do that anymore.'' And it has really hit that point now.
    Ms. DeLauro. Dr. Liang.
    Dr. Liang. Thank you, Ranking Member DeLauro.
    So we are already putting in another 20-some percent of our 
own funds to cover the unreimbursed F&amp;amp;A. And so, you know, we 
will have a gap there if the cap is capped at 10 percent, and 
we will have to go to tuition and try to find more philanthropy 
sources. And the State of Connecticut has reduced the block 
grant to the university, and so we will be really in a bind. 
And I think we are going to have to be very strategic in a way 
we don't want to be by closing down certain research programs.
    I think, you know, as a scientist, I can attest to the fact 
that a lot of the discovery is by serendipity. And if you are 
trying to be too top-down and strategic, you are going to lose 
a lot of basic knowledge and that scientific talent, and it 
would be really devastating.
    Thank you.
    Ms. DeLauro. Dr. Gilliland.
    Dr. Gilliland. Yes, thank you.
    Not too much to add, except that we do--and thank you for 
the proper pronunciation. I am very grateful.
    We do renegotiate our rates as a research institute every 
year with the HHS. It is a civilized process, but, nonetheless, 
we don't recover about $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 a year in 
indirect costs. And the way that we make that up is through 
philanthropy. I would like to spend my time focusing on curing 
cancer, but I spend about 30 percent of my time in 
philanthropic efforts to help support our budget.
    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Cole. Thank you.
    We next go, by order of arrival, to Mr. Fleischmann. Is----
    Ms. DeLauro. He just left.
    Mr. Cole. He just left, so there you go. Okay. We now go 
to, then, my good friend from Maryland, Dr. Harris.
    Mr. Harris. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. 
Chairman, for calling a hearing on a very important topic.
    First of all, I am just--and you don't have to answer--I am 
just puzzled by this discrepancy, because, you know, HHS does 
pay a fairly large indirect-cost percent. So I assume the 
discrepancy really occurs from all those other grants that 
aren't NIH grants.
    The ones, for instance, listed on this--and I don't need an 
answer, because I only have 5 minutes. For instance, all these 
groups listed on this slide vary from the American Lung 
Association, with no indirect-cost reimbursement; American 
Cancer Society, 20 percent; American Heart, 10 percent.
    And, you know, the testimony that Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates, you 
know, covers facilities--but you have to mention that change 
was made in February of this year, after the administration had 
said, let's take a look at indirect costs because of this 
discrepancy.
    Now, let me go to the next slide here. Now, here is one of 
the problems. The question is, what are we doing in our medical 
research universities, and are we, in fact, training or 
educating the next generation of researchers?
    This slide--all of you, I am sure, are familiar with it--is 
the graph of the age at which people make their great 
discoveries. So, for instance, the physician you mentioned at 
Fred Hutch, the one who developed the transplantation of 
leukocytes to treat leukemia, made his discovery in his late 
thirties.
    Next slide.
    If you look at when RO1 grants, the major grants--go one 
more slide, this one--when RO1, the major grant over at NIH, 
was made and the age distribution, in 1980, strangely enough, 
the peak of distribution was in the late thirties. That is when 
the NIH was awarding these grants, to people in their late 
thirties. That is when people actually, statistically, make 
their great discoveries.
    Now, let's go to the other slide. Let's fast-forward 35 
years, with what has happened over at the NIH. This is the 
graph from 2015. Markedly different. The peak is now at 50. 
Now, I am 60. I used to do NIH research. I am not going to make 
a great discovery, because you know what? Once you reach that 
age, you put blinders on.
    So we have asked the academic institutions over the years 
to come up with ideas for how to solve this. And I have had 
many presidents of universities in my office say, ``It is easy. 
Just give us more money.''
    Next slide.
    This shows the NIH funding from 1980 on the left to 2015 on 
the right. So, as we were increasing funding from 
$4,000,000,000 to $32,000,000,000, the grants were going to 
older and older individuals.
    Now, I am going to ask Dr. Yamamoto, I have a letter here--
because, you know, I talked with Dr. Collins about this 
problem: Are we doing the right thing at the NIH, and methods 
with which we are trying to solve this. So he came up with the 
GSI, you know, the grant scoring index, the one that says: You 
know what? There is actually evidence from the NIH that, once 
you get multiple grants, the last grants are actually much less 
productive than the first grants. It makes human sense. You 
know, you only have so many things you can think about at once. 
Your major projects are going to be the ones you think about; 
the less major ones are not.
    But remember, the indirect costs are the same for all those 
grants. Whether it is your first grant or your fifth grant, the 
indirect costs are the same.
    You said in your letter to your faculty that there are 42 
UCSF investigators who were threatened by the GSI. And, 
strangely enough, the GSI plan was shot down a month and a half 
later, withdrawn by NIH, because academic universities, on the 
whole, opposed the GSI.
    Now, why? You have to ask the question, why? Is it because 
we really want all the senior investigators to get their fourth 
and fifth and sixth grants that have 52-percent or 60-percent 
indirect costs?
    I was in this business. Universities love NIH grants 
because they come with large indirect costs associated with 
them. Allowed them to build big buildings. Allowed them to 
build great facilities. Great facilities actually have the 
option of curing cancer.
    But have we lost a very important point there? And I am 
going to ask each of you. Have we lost our ability to say one 
of our major goals is to train young investigators?
    Now, I was involved, and I know that there are theories 
that, you know, this was cooked up in order to just lower the 
NIH budget. No, it wasn't, because I know the indirect-costs 
subject was brought up to make universities think about the 
future of research in America.
    And remember, the GSI press release by Dr. Collins said 
there was 6,000 more grants that could be funded if we 
instituted GSI. And I would make certain--I would do my best to 
make certain these went to young investigators.
    So a method to reduce NIH expenditures at some point by 
perhaps capping indirect costs, like is done in other 
institutions, why couldn't we use that money to turn over and 
start shifting that curve back to young investigators? A very 
quick response from all of you. Shouldn't we do that? Shouldn't 
we put more emphasis on young investigators? Quickly. It could 
be a ``yes'' or a ``no'' response.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Droegemeier. I think we absolutely should. I think it 
is a very important problem. NSF has dealt with this same 
thing, of getting the young investigators. I don't think the 
F&amp;amp;A is the way to solve that problem, though.
    In fact, to your earlier point about those percentages you 
showed, it is important to realize that the Federal Government 
funds 55 percent of the research in this country; the 
universities fund 24 percent; the philanthropic organizations 
fund 6 percent. Their role is very, very different than the 
Federal Government. So, although we have low indirect-cost 
rates, they represent a really small fraction of the money we 
expend.
    So, therefore, we eat some of that fund, but if that 
happened to NIH, that is why we would be dead in the water, 
because it is 55 percent the Federal Government. You start 
monkeying with that 55 percent, we are in serious trouble. We 
can handle a little bit with the foundations because they have 
a much different role and they are a much smaller percentage.
    Mr. Yamamoto. So I agree with that.
    Let me just take a different tack to your question, Dr. 
Harris, and that is that this increased age of investigators 
and your zeal, which you have had for a long time, to support 
young investigators--and I share that with you, as we have 
discussed in your office--would not be addressed in a 
substantial way by changes in F&amp;amp;A.
    The capacity to fund more investigators or, actually, to 
issue more grants is a positive one when resources are limited, 
as they are. But whether the--my letter and those of other 
investigators about the concerns about the GSI was not to 
oppose those ideas, but, in fact, because we felt that the 
metrics by which these measurements were being made were not 
correct. Different kinds of research cost very different 
amounts of money. And so simply measuring dollars and 
restricting the researchers in that way is not appropriate.
    I know that the NIH--we are working with them to look for 
other ways to try to measure this, and I know that the Deputy 
Director for Extramural Research is working on this very 
actively. So whether this can be done and whether it would have 
an impact on the support for young investigators, I think, is 
something that we need to look very carefully at.
    You probably know that the National Academy of Sciences is 
undertaking two studies right now--I am on one of the study 
committees--to look at the way that graduate education works in 
STEM disciplines. Another one is explicitly targeted to support 
for new investigators. Those reports we will be issuing in the 
next year. I think that you will--I hope that you will be 
excited about what some of the things are that we are putting 
forward.
    And so I think there are approaches to that problem that 
you have so long focused on that can be very productive. I am 
not convinced that changing the F&amp;amp;A is one of them.
    Dr. Liang. Thank you.
    My answer is fairly straightforward. I think if you take 
away the F&amp;amp;A reimbursement, it will affect the young 
investigators more than it would the established investigators, 
because their labs do not have all the equipment and the know-
how that build up over the years.
    And we will have to find other sources to support the F&amp;amp;A 
costs, which, as we heard earlier today, is really a real cost. 
And, as Representative DeLauro said, it is a misnomer. It is 
really part of the real cost.
    So I think you are going to really more adversely affect 
the young investigators. And you wouldn't be able to use 
sources of funding to stimulate high-risk-but-high-reward 
research pilot studies in which the young people have these 
wonderful, thinking-outside-the-box ideas, and you are going to 
have to use those resources to fund the real costs, which is 
the F&amp;amp;A. And so I think it is going to be worse for the young 
investigators.
    Thank you.
    Dr. Gilliland. Dr. Harris, I share your passion for 
training young investigators. And it is also terrific to have a 
committee member who has been the recipient of NIH funding. So 
I do appreciate your perspectives.
    We have a variety of mechanisms for supporting young 
investigators at the Hutch. As one example, every new recruit 
that comes in--and we are actively recruiting--has a 
$2,500,000-or-so startup package that comes from philanthropy 
that we use to ensure that they are not dependent upon NIH 
support moving forward.
    I would also say that there are certain NIH grants, like 
training grants, that are really important for young, 
burgeoning investigators that only bring in 8-percent indirect-
cost rates by stipulation. So we do need to make up that 
balance.
    And, lastly, I do appreciate you showing the slide on the 
foundations, but I would say that it is a bit of an apples-and-
oranges comparison because many foundations will allow 
accounting methods that take into account indirect costs. For 
example, foundations will help support our infrastructure for T 
cell immunotherapy. And the Gates Foundation, in particular, 
from whom we can't accept all the resources we could get 
because we can't afford to, they do have an infrastructure 
grant that they have awarded to the Hutch because they 
understand the challenges in trying to support our global HIV 
vaccine trials network.
    But very important points. And it is really important for 
us to dial back and have people that look less like you and me 
and people that are younger leading the charge.
    Mr. Cole. I guess we send people over 60 to Congress, 
right?
    If we could, again, on order of arrival, we will go to my 
good friend, Mr. Pocan.
    Mr. Pocan. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you to the panelists.
    You know, first, I think the good news is, you know, in 
what has been at times--it is a difficult Congress to get 
things through both houses and signed into law. The good news 
is, on NIH, there is bipartisan agreement. Thanks to our 
subcommittee chairman and our ranking member and other 
advocates, we have been really fortunate in being able to get 
additional dollars for NIH.
    And I think, even on this issue, when we had Secretary 
Price here, who was a fiscal hawk, on this issue--no longer is 
here, I am not sure if the same emphasis is going to be as much 
on this issue. Because, as I talk to Members and hear Members, 
it seems like people really understand this indirect-cost issue 
in a better, more comprehensive way.
    So there are two things I would like to get to you. So, on 
the first one, if we could get, like, 30- to 40-second answers.
    To be fair, if we are putting more dollars and we want more 
dollars going to research, what are some of the barriers that 
you are having as you get the money? For example, the 
University of Wisconsin, which would lose about $50,000,000 
under this proposal, has said some of the--in order to justify 
the cost, it is something that is a real burden on the 
regulation side, so to speak.
    Just 30 to 40 seconds each, if you could, what could make 
it so the money is even more being delivered to care or to 
finding cures?
    Mr. Droegemeier. Irrespective of F&amp;amp;A, right?
    Mr. Pocan. Yes.
    Mr. Droegemeier. Yeah. I would say, absolutely, the 
regulatory framework that we have right now. Two studies 
successively have shown, by the Federal Demonstration 
Partnership, that faculty who are funded by the Federal 
Government, on average, spend 42 percent of their time on 
administrative activities. And we all agree that for human-
subjects research, animal research, things like that, there are 
very, very important regulations that need to be followed--
laboratory safety and so on. But a lot of these regulations 
really have no impact at all, have been shown to have no 
impact, but yet they really are suppressing our research 
system.
    So we think about waste, fraud, and abuse. I think one of 
the biggest abuses and the wastes that we have is the 
intellectual talent of our faculty and researchers because of 
all this administrative burden, some of it very, very 
important; other of it really isn't needed at all.
    And so I think focusing on that, which Congress is doing, 
and so is the National Academy, very effectively, I think that 
would be my answer.
    Mr. Pocan. Thank you.
    Mr. Yamamoto. I don't have much to add to that. I totally 
agree with that. I got my first NIH grant when I was 30, and I 
should clearly be shown the door by now. But it was a different 
world. When I got that grant when I was 30, I was able to spend 
all my time in the lab doing work, and now it is exactly what 
Dr. Droegemeier said. I spend all my time kind of chasing down 
regulatory reports, compliance reports, and doing things that 
actually could be addressed well.
    There are several reports that have come out, some from the 
National Academies, that deal with the administrative-burden 
issue. And I really hope that members of this committee or 
other Congress Members will take up that charge, because that 
really is the biggest problem. It not only is very wasteful of 
resources, but it really changes the way that we--the time and 
energy going completely into thinking about science. And simply 
just sitting back and reflecting on what is going on in the lab 
makes all the difference, and that is the time that goes away 
first.
    Dr. Liang. I don't have much to add. I would just echo the 
comments.
    And I think, as an administrator now, I do my best to 
protect the young investigators' time and to protect their time 
and to try to steer their attention and effort to ask the right 
science questions and to give them the resources that they need 
to build their scientific research programs.
    So I think less time spent on regulatory areas, other than 
IRB and the IACUC, the Animal Ethics Committee, would be 
helpful.
    Thank you.
    Dr. Gilliland. I echo those comments, Congressman, but I 
would also add that our faculty spend, on average, 50 to 55 
percent of their time writing grants, responding to reviews on 
grants, recycling grants, administrative support. Some of them 
are very good at it, but that is not what we select them for. 
We select them to be brilliant, creative, innovative 
scientists. And I would rather have them spending time doing 
that and not as much time in the grant-writing process.
    So we do a lot to support them. We are trying to move to a 
model where we can give our faculty resources that we can raise 
from exogenous sources like philanthropy so that they are able 
to focus on their science and think about their science and not 
think about the mechanics.
    I will give one example that is terrific, though, from the 
National Cancer Institute, which is that we have an 
investigator named Denise Galloway. She is the woman who 
connected the dots between human papilloma virus and cervical 
cancer that led to the vaccine that was developed at Merck that 
has the potential to prevent more than 90 percent of cervical 
cancer worldwide. That is what she should be focused on.
    And the NCI gave her this fantastic grant called an 
Outstanding Investigator Award that runs for 7 years with 
nominal reporting strategies. You usually only get this when 
you get to be my age, but she is still doing incredible work. 
And it is a great chance for her to think about her science and 
not to have to focus on some of the administrative 
responsibilities.
    Ms. DeLauro. That is potentially 4,000 lives a year for 
women.
    Dr. Gilliland. In the United States. But worldwide, Sub-
Saharan Africa, China, cervical cancer is an enormous 
challenge. And it is a lot better to prevent cancer than it is 
to treat, I can tell you that, as you well know.
    Mr. Pocan. Thank you.
    Mr. Cole. I feel like I ought to give you extra time, but 
you have actually gotten us back to the 5-minute clock, so I 
want to thank my good friend for that.
    We will next go to Mr. Moolenaar.
    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And I want to thank all of our guests here.
    A number of you mentioned that the F&amp;amp;A cap would impact 
training programs, either shrinking or terminating some of 
those, and would hinder the professional and educational 
opportunities for the next generation.
    I wondered if you have thoughts on how that would impact 
the future of our healthcare workforce, especially as we are 
facing a shortage of healthcare workers, and what this would 
mean for the next generation of scientists.
    Mr. Droegemeier. I will be happy to start.
    I think one of the things that is important to recognize--
we haven't talked about this--is that a lot of the 
universities, I think, who would sort of succumb to this cap 
are in areas that have large populations of underrepresented 
individuals. So I think we would see a decline in the 
increasing participation of those populations in research, 
which, if you look at the trends of the demographics in this 
country, means that we are not going to have enough folks to do 
the research.
    Also, those same universities produce a lot of the faculty 
that are hired by the top institutions in the country. They 
also hire those individuals. So if those--and I can refer to 
some data I have in my report for NIH in terms of the funding. 
The F&amp;amp;A goes to the top 50 institutions of 500; 10 percent of 
the institutions get 70 percent of the F&amp;amp;A. So, if those other 
institutions, those other 450, start to decline and, you know, 
get pushed aside, basically, they are not a supplier of talent 
to the other institutions, nor are they hiring the individuals 
who become their faculty.
    So it really is underrepresented groups get harmed and also 
the supply and demand of faculty positions and researchers gets 
changed.
    Mr. Moolenaar. The other thing, just to follow up on that, 
I wanted to ask, you know, it seems like right now we have 
large and small, public and private universities, nonprofit. Do 
you think the smaller, less established institutions, 
laboratories, would be able to compete for the funding if we 
remove that?
    Mr. Droegemeier. I think it would be very difficult for 
them because they don't have the infrastructures and they also 
don't have some of the financial resources that larger 
institutions do. But I think, ultimately, even the well-
resourced institutions would find it very difficult, as time 
goes on, to make up the difference of the lost F&amp;amp;A.
    Mr. Yamamoto. I think that the up-and-coming institutions 
would suffer first. And we need that kind of diversity in our 
scientific enterprise as much as any of the other kinds of 
diversity that we are thinking about.
    We have to have different ways of thinking about problems, 
because our chances of having our ideas being correct are 
actually small. There is one way to be right and an infinite 
number of ways to be wrong. Right? And if everybody in the 
enterprise trained together and thinks together, then you could 
actually have the whole enterprise going down the wrong 
pathway.
    So having that diversity is really a crucial thing, and I 
think it is something that we really need to be attentive to.
    I just want to make one other quick point, and that is that 
Gary mentioned this ``inflection point'' term, and I want to 
address it in the terms of our training and our training 
population.
    And that is that we are at a place in research, biomedical 
research and other research as well, where the potential for 
Ph.D.-trained individuals in the sciences to be able to 
contribute to society not only as faculty members in our 
research institutions that we are discussing but in a whole 
range of other fields--as you all well know, decisions that 
society is going to be making now and in the future are going 
to be increasingly technology-driven, and they are going to 
have to be wise decisions that are based on real knowledge and 
understanding of what those technologies are, what the 
potentials are, and what the potential downsides are.
    That kind of understanding, we really need people, you 
know, all parts of our society, to be able to advise us about 
that, not just in science and medicine, but these trained 
people going out to fill positions in policy, as you are all 
doing, and in communication and education and business and law, 
because those are the stakeholders that are going to be 
involved in making and driving these decisions.
    So we lose the workforce because of a drop-off of the 
capacity to support NIH research. And we are losing not just 
the kinds of a scientific and health advances that we will be 
hearing about, but we really affect society's capacity to be 
able to make the right decisions.
    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you.
    And, Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask one last question 
that may go a little bit over.
    If I understood what you said, you said your researchers 
spend almost 50 percent of their time doing compliance-
related----
    Dr. Gilliland. I said that.
    Mr. Moolenaar. Are there some key areas that we could look 
at to improve that so that they are actually spending more time 
on the research function? And is that something you could make 
recommendations to the committee moving forward?
    Dr. Gilliland. Well, I think I can address that, that it 
really does come down to what the paylines are. At the National 
Cancer Institute, it is around 9 percent, so that is 1 in 10 
grants. It just means you have to continually be writing grants 
and rewriting grants. It means, when you submit the grant, it 
often isn't funded the first cycle; you need to come back for 
the next cycle.
    So I think it is largely a function of paylines. When the 
paylines were where they were when Keith and I were young, in 
the 20- to 25-percent range, it was much more tractable.
    But to your point about the impact on training, for us, if 
the lower cap is imposed, we just won't be able to accept as 
many grants. So we will go through a process where we will have 
to do internal prioritization before we even allow somebody to 
send a grant in. And then they go through the 9-percent 
paylines at the NCI for our institution.
    And that scares off kids who are thinking about going into 
science. We have a lot of them that get their Ph.D.s in the 
biomedical sciences, and, at least in Seattle, they will go off 
and work for Amazon or Microsoft or Google. So I really worry 
about the impact that we won't be able to measure, who is it 
that didn't go into science because it looks so onerous in 
terms of trying to obtain grant support.
    And to the point about diversity of thought that Keith 
made, you should take the sequester as an example. The larger 
institutions have an easier time weathering that, for a variety 
of reasons. We can't afford to lose the diversity of thought 
around this country and to have the big get bigger and have the 
small go away. We can't afford to have that happen.
    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Cole. You are welcome.
    We will go now to my good friend from California, Ms. Lee.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [Off-mike] 350 research agreements, approximately 
$63,000,000, paying 57-percent rate that NIH and other Federal 
offices currently agreed to in order to access university 
research infrastructure.
    So, if the cap were 10 percent and universities were forced 
to turn to other financial realities, what would that mean for 
global competitive research, and who would universities turn to 
for this research?
    Secondly, in the letter, it was mentioned, the fact that a 
10-percent cap would have adverse impacts on fostering job 
creation and American economic competitiveness and healthcare 
outcomes, of course, for all citizens.
    So I would like for you to respond to those two questions: 
Where would universities go for additional research money if 
the 10 percent were capped? And what would this do in terms of 
our economic growth and competitiveness and job creation?
    Mr. Yamamoto. So I think that we have addressed your 
question in part, Congresswoman Lee. And it is nice to see you, 
as well.
    You know, UCSF received approximately $624,000,000 in 
funding in 2016 from the NIH. $465,000,000 of that was for 
direct costs, and $159,000,000 was for F&amp;amp;A. That left us with a 
shortfall at which UCSF had to come up with $77,000,000 to be 
able to cover the F&amp;amp;A shortfall. That means for every thousand 
dollars of NIH funding that UCSF received in 2016 UCSF 
contributed an additional $166 that it had to pull together 
from other sources.
    If the 10-percent cap were installed, as I said, we would 
be facing a really dire shortfall that we really wouldn't be 
able to address if it were installed in this draconian way. 
Yes, of course, we would scramble to try to find other 
resources, but the outcome of it, as you implied, is that U.S. 
scientific competitiveness would take an immediate hit.
    It is great that you brought this up. I mean, we live in a 
world economy, and other countries are moving very rapidly to 
try to--or they are sort of incorporating this notion that the 
U.S. has moved forward because its prowess in scientific 
research. If you look at what is happening in India and China 
and South Korea, they are putting double-digit increases into 
their scientific budgets every year.
    And so, if NIH were to pull back, even if it were in this 
factional way of changing the F&amp;amp;A costs, the impact on all of 
our institutions would be dire, and it would just allow these 
other countries to move forward. So the competitive issue is a 
serious one we need to keep in mind as we look at these 
policies.
    Mr. Droegemeier. I would just say that I think, really, 
this cut really potentially endangers the partnership that 
dates back 70 years between the Federal Government and 
universities that won World War II. And I think, ultimately, 
the success of our Nation and, really, competing in the world 
really requires the government and the universities to work 
hand-in-hand.
    And, in fact, if you look at the current OMB guidance, it 
talks about paying their fair share. A 10-percent cap would 
shift a massive amount of the funding burden to universities, 
and that fundamentally changes the role of the Federal 
Government in the research enterprise. It really puts it on the 
backs of the universities, who are now problematically funded 
by States and things like that that don't have the resources, 
that aren't going to raise tuition and so on.
    So I think the partnership model starts to come undone, and 
that has really massive consequences for us when we are facing 
other nations that are investing, as Dr. Yamamoto said, and 
moving very, very rapidly. China, India, you look at the number 
of papers, the number of students they are producing, the 
number of patents and so on. They are investing massively. If 
we pull back and undo that partnership, it is going to be very, 
very difficult to recover.
    Dr. Liang. I would just add that the infrastructure that is 
allowed by the F&amp;amp;A reimbursements are critical not just to 
support the research at the university, but an important 
byproduct is the science and invention to start up companies. 
So it is a very important way to get return on the investment. 
And if we take that away, the downstream consequences would be 
adverse for the economic job creation piece of it.
    Dr. Gilliland. I would just add, Congresswoman, that one 
unintended consequence, as I alluded to, would be that it will 
be even more difficult to get grants in that context. It 
certainly would be at our institution. And the consequence is 
that people won't focus on the cool, creative, innovative, 
high-risk-high-reward type of science. They will focus on 
things that can get funded and things that are inherently 
predictable. And, yes, it is likely to yield ``important new 
information,'' is one of the phrases that comes out of NIH 
study sections.
    So I do have some concerns about the impact on our ability 
to maintain our world-leading pace in the creative and 
innovative space, which is where the most important advances 
will come.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Cole. I thank the gentlelady.
    We will go next to my good friend from Idaho, Mr. Simpson.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you all for being here today.
    First, let me get rid of one of my pet peeves. Over 80 
percent of the NIH funding goes to extramural grants to you 
all. And when a discovery is made of a new drug that cures 
whatever or helps whatever, the press releases all that kind of 
stuff, newspaper articles, all about the researcher, all about 
the university, all about the Hutch or whatever, you know. 
Nothing about NIH in any of this stuff.
    What I am saying is: Help us help you by educating the 
public that it is their tax dollars that are doing this through 
NIH and stuff. Because if I go out on the street, most people 
don't even know what NIH is. I understand where you are coming 
from, but help us in that regard.
    Secondly, I guess we can thank the administration for this 
hearing today. Had they not proposed their proposal in the 
budget which we rejected, we probably wouldn't even be having 
this hearing on F&amp;amp;A costs and that kind of stuff, and I think 
it is a vital hearing that we have.
    I am a big fan of what goes on at NIH and what goes on at 
the universities and the research that is done. I have to 
preface my remarks saying that, because it might not sound 
friendly when I ask this question.
    I appreciate Dr. Harris' input on this and the challenges 
that we face. But this is what happens out at the universities, 
and you all know this. All the universities want to become 
research facilities. They want to expand their role, attract 
students because they have more research and stuff. So they go 
out and they raise money, private foundation, maybe through the 
State building authority, to build a new biomedical research 
facility. They get a bill. Then comes the cost of operating it.
    And I am sure, in the preplanning, part of the cost of 
operation is, how many grants can we get that will help us 
offset the cost of operating it? Is that true? I mean, that is 
an obvious thing that you would look at, at how we are going to 
do it.
    So then when we talk about whether 26 percent is the right 
percent or not, it is kind of like, well, if we don't get this 
26 percent, we are going to have to close this facility that we 
went out and initiated to build so that we could expand our 
research.
    How much of that 26 percent of the overall facilities 
administrative costs of a grant would still exist if you didn't 
get the grant?
    Dr. Gilliland. Well, I can take a first stab at that, 
Congressman. And it is a really important question.
    I will say, first of all, that our buildings, at least on 
our site, are built with debt and philanthropy. We don't 
receive any Federal funds or State funds to support those.
    We do use indirect-cost rates to support, in essence, the 
space or the rental costs, if you want to think of it that way. 
But if you compare the cost in terms of our indirect rate by 
using a building that we put up with debt and philanthropy to 
what we would have to pay in the South Lake Union area for 
market rental, that is about a 50-percent savings on what it 
would cost if we didn't have those facilities in place.
    So we are very sensitive to that issue. This should not be 
a strategy for putting up buildings, and it should not be a 
strategy where you have to close the building down. But the 
government doesn't take any risk, we take the risk, associated 
with the cost of the building and the mortgages and the debt.
    Mr. Simpson. And I understand what you are saying, because 
you are a private entity as opposed to a university. And 
universities are always competing against one another.
    Are we doing it wisely, and are we using this as a way of 
helping us expand our research capabilities as a university so 
that we become a more modern research university and that kind 
of stuff and then saying, the Federal Government needs to help 
us in this arena?
    Mr. Droegemeier. I think when the NIH budget doubled in the 
late 1990s and early 2000s, I think there was a large amount of 
building going on. In fact, people have written papers on this. 
Bruce Alberts and other people have written papers that talked 
about----
    Mr. Simpson. And let me say, I am not saying that that 
increased building and stuff is a bad thing.
    Mr. Droegemeier. Right. Right. Right. No, you are 
absolutely right. And, of course, we educate students in there, 
so when we actually do the audits for the F&amp;amp;A rate setting, we 
only look at the space that is set aside for research. But how 
do you differentiate when you are educating a student versus 
doing research, especially if you are undergraduates and so on 
and so forth?
    So I think universities are much more sensitive to that now 
in the past 10 years, probably, or so, to not overbuild. They 
look at Federal budgets; they see that they are not going to be 
growing and doubling and so on and so forth.
    So I think there was some of that that happened in the late 
1990s with the doubling, but I don't think it is happening now. 
If you look at the last year for which data are available--I 
just, actually, looked this up the other day--in terms of new 
construction, the government funded 15.8 percent of buildings, 
and the institutions themselves funded 63.7 percent. So, by and 
large, the government isn't funding a lot of new construction.
    But when the buildings are built in debt service, we do 
include the interest in the F&amp;amp;A rate. But I think there is a 
lot of scrutiny on that now, and I think universities have 
gotten wise to the fact that it is very, very difficult to 
build lots and lots of buildings, because you won't be able to 
fund their usage. And, at the end of the day, you have to pay 
the debt service on them if you don't, you know, fully pay for 
the buildings up front.
    So I don't think that is as much of an issue as it was 15 
or 20 years ago, but that is a very, very good point that you 
raise.
    Mr. Simpson. I appreciate it.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Cole. You are welcome.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. We have spoken a lot about the impact of 
the 10-percent cap on your universities and on students, but I 
would like to discuss the impacts of these potential cuts on 
larger research communities.
    Most of your institutions are located in communities that 
are also home to biotech companies that benefit from university 
research collaborations. If F&amp;amp;A funding is cut and universities 
are forced to support smaller research portfolios, what would 
be the impact on the biotech companies that were attracted to 
robust university research communities, and what impact would 
it have on the overall economy in your regions?
    Mr. Yamamoto. You are absolutely right that one of the 
great outcomes of the real revolution in our understanding of 
biomedical processes and disease processes has been on the 
economic end. And the first biotech company in the Nation, 
Genentech, was actually started by a UCSF researcher. And it 
was really a watershed moment, because it indicated for the 
first time that basic biomedical research could actually be 
made into a product that could make money in a company and 
actually have impact, direct impact, on people's health and 
well-being. Those two things are incredibly powerful, and it 
has led to the biotech revolution you are talking about.
    And so, a pullback in the capacity of this government 
compact with the academic research community would actually 
have a very strong detrimental effect on the capacity to start 
up new companies and to keep them healthy and going strong.
    UCSF's Mission Bay campus is surrounded by biotech and 
pharma companies, many of which were started from the research 
that goes on there, and many of them are actually my trainees 
who were at UCSF at the time. And so now pulling back from that 
commitment, that compact, would actually have dire consequences 
on this economic engine that has developed.
    Dr. Gilliland. Yeah, I would echo those comments. We are 
also surrounded by biotech in the Seattle area, and it comes 
back to this issue around how do you foster creativity and 
innovation. Because that is the real value. That is where the 
intellectual property comes into play that is attractive for 
biotech.
    And I will also add to that that, although some academic 
institutions have--well, they probably all have a certain 
amount of hubris, but--have hubris around their ability to 
actually make a drug or develop a drug within house, I can tell 
you, having been on the other side of the fence in pharma, that 
that is simply not tractable. We absolutely depend on biotech 
and pharma to take our discoveries and translate them into 
clinical benefit. And that is the model that we use at the 
Hutch, and I do think it would be deleteriously impacted.
    Dr. Liang. And I will also echo those comments. It is a 
very good question. Yale-New Haven area, with bioscience 
ventures, that has been growing for quite some time in 
Farmington with UConn Health and Jackson Lab for Genomic 
Medicine and the University of Connecticut as doors. We are 
also seeing growing activities in the biotech innovation 
attracting folks and companies from outside the State, in fact, 
to come to Farmington.
    We have built the facilities basically based on State 
support, and we are being able to rent out space to companies 
from both within UConn invention as well as outside UConn.
    But thank you very much for that very relevant question.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Just one more question. The United 
States is currently number one in biomedical research. However, 
as Federal funding for research has declined in the U.S., young 
researchers have left for other countries or have left the 
field altogether.
    Fewer researchers means fewer scientific publications. How 
will a potential decrease in peer-reviewed journal articles and 
the global release of new scientific data impact the standing 
of the U.S. in global scientific communities?
    Dr. Gilliland. Thank you, Congresswoman. That is a great 
question, and it will have an impact.
    I was just in China a few weeks ago. And competition is a 
good thing. I think it spurs us all on. But if you want to see 
a very impressive scientific economy and worry about our world-
leading position, spend a few weeks walking around their 
universities and their biotech companies. It is really 
impressive. And I do have concerns around our maintaining our 
leadership role in that context.
    Mr. Yamamoto. And you might say that, relevant to my 
earlier comments about the global futures of this endeavor now, 
that it doesn't matter, that we just want science to move 
forward and it will all be okay. But it turns out that U.S. 
science has set the standard for the way that research should 
be done for discovery, for innovation, for really bold 
thinking. And for years, we were able to float along on that 
even if the budgets weren't very strong. But the other 
countries have realized that this is their ticket to being able 
to become really powerfully developed nations. And so they are 
pushing hard for this.
    And I think that what I come down to, when you think about 
this, is the imperative for U.S. science to maintain this top 
position. Because we have set the standards for the way that 
things are done. We have set, kind of, the behavioral ways that 
scientists act as colleagues and competitors to be able to try 
to move forward. And those elements are not really baked into 
these other cultures yet, and so I think it is really crucial 
that we maintain that role. And I think being mindful of your 
kinds of insights and questions is something that we really 
need to maintain going forward.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Thank you.
    Mr. Cole. Ms. Herrera Beutler.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    You know, I wanted to ask Dr. Gilliland about ROI, and I 
will, but I want to also refer first to a comment you made. I 
think it was in response to Dr. Harris' question, but you were 
talking about getting private dollars from some of these 
foundations. And you said, specifically, ``I can't accept''--I 
think you were talking about Bill and Melinda Gates, but you 
said, ``I can't accept all the money because I can't afford 
to.'' And I was hoping you could elaborate on that really 
quickly.
    Dr. Gilliland. The Gates Foundation does use a different 
accounting method for calculating indirect-cost rates, so they 
do provide more than just the 20-percent support if you think 
about it from that perspective, that they do allow for certain 
infrastructure elements, for the global HIV vaccine trials 
network, for example. But they don't cover the full costs.
    So we need to make that up. And we have only two ways of 
doing that, sort of, as a research institute, which is to use 
philanthropy or to try to capitalize on some of the value that 
has been brought from our intellectual property and from 
spinout companies. But, all that being said, we put in about 
$69,500,000 last year from philanthropic sources towards 
balancing our indirect-cost rates.
    There are grants that one of our divisions would love to 
have from the Gates Foundation, and I have to say, no, we can't 
afford to do that unless I get a little bit better at 
fundraising. And I am working on that. But that is a sad thing 
for me, because these are great projects. But we have to 
prioritize which are the ones that we think are really 
important. Because we do lose money on them, and we will make 
that up. But the things that are really important, like a 
vaccine for HIV, we are out there trying to support.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. So it is costing you--so you have 
researchers who want to do certain things and want to go after 
money, but you can't necessarily cover all the back-end costs. 
You can't allow them to just go for it, basically.
    Dr. Gilliland. Well, that is correct, and that is true for 
foundations. So we do have a prioritization process that 
evaluates any project that has unrecovered F&amp;amp;A, because we have 
to make that balance up to be in compliance with Federal 
regulations. And there are things we just say, no, you can't 
apply for this, because, even though it is a cool idea, 
collectively, as an institution, we have to prioritize that 
against things that we think are really important to our 
mission and our strategic plan. So, yes.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. And to what role the NIH funding is 
going to play, keeping whole the other pieces?
    Dr. Gilliland. I am not sure I understand.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. So, like, if that money isn't there--
or maybe I am not understanding it right--to basically cover 
costs--like, if--how much can you backfill with other, 
whether--you said fundraising or philanthropy.
    Dr. Gilliland. If we had an infinite amount of 
philanthropic support--and there is a lot of wealth in the 
Seattle area, so we are working on that--we could open our arms 
and say, do anything that you want to do. But there are 
projects that we have to prioritize as not being high enough 
priority; we just can't afford to do that in a fiscally 
responsibility way.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. On the ROI front, obviously, we have 
heard that the Federal resources--all resources are very 
precious, and we want to steward those as appropriately and 
correctly.
    Can you please discuss a little bit about how the Hutch is 
promoting, kind of, the ROI concept?
    Dr. Gilliland. Well, thank you for that question.
    We are trying to do everything that we can to publicize the 
return on investment. To Congressman Simpson's point, it is 
really important to make sure that the NIH is included in that.
    So, whenever we talk about the Women's Health Initiative 
that was funded by the NIH, we talk about the value 
proposition, the return on investment of $37,000,000,000 and 
lives saved, primarily from a reduction in breast cancer risk 
but also cardiovascular risk. We make sure that the NIH is 
applauded for that, but also point out the ROI, which is: That 
was a $180,000,000 trial. It was expensive--160,000 women 
followed over 10 years. But the return on investment for our 
society is spectacular.
    I have mentioned the example with Denise Galloway and the 
HPV vaccine--huge return on investment worldwide for the work 
that she did. And the cooperative group trials, which in cancer 
sometimes take a hit, that data from the SWOG trials showing 
that there were 334 million years of patient life extended with 
the $418,000,000 that was spent on the trials. That is $125 per 
patient-year, which is extraordinary.
    So there is value there, but the other value, 
Congresswoman, is that, when we have the opportunity to be 
creative, we can think about strategies like taking a cancer 
patient's own immune cells out of their body, genetically 
reprogramming them to put in a laser guidance system and a 
molecular explosive device to seek out and destroy cancer 
cells. So we are getting cure rates in people who had death 
sentences for diseases like acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 93-
percent complete response rates, with this technology that is 
out-of-the-box thinking.
    That return on investment is harder to measure right now. 
There will be commercial value to that, ultimately. But the 
value is seeing women named Stephanie, for example, who was 
dead, I mean, literally a few weeks to live, now going out to 
meet with our donors and our philanthropists to say, ``Look at 
me. I shouldn't be here today.''
    That return for me, personally, that one life saved, is 
extraordinarily important. So we have a saying, ``No lives left 
behind.'' That is what we are trying to do in our approach to 
treating cancer. We have to show the value proposition 
economically to our Federal regulators and our government, but 
that is the kind of return that we are looking for.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Cole. We don't have much time left, because, frankly, 
this has been a really good panel, and the members have been 
really engaged, but I want to give everybody at least an 
opportunity for one more. So, if we could, I am going to drop 
this to 2 minutes. And then, obviously, Ms. DeLauro and I, if 
you have any final thoughts, we will have an opportunity for 
that too.
    I will forego my time, since we don't have a lot here, and 
I want to go directly to my friend, the gentlelady from 
Connecticut.
    Ms. DeLauro. If you could, one or two of you, we have 
alluded to the negotiating process for indirect costs with the 
appropriate Federal agency--the documentation, et cetera. Can 
you just walk us quickly through that process and what it 
entails so that we get some idea there of--and equate it to 
whether or not frivolous expenses can get uncovered or not 
covered. Just walk us quickly through the process so we get 
some idea of what you are going through.
    Mr. Droegemeier. Sure.
    So, at my own university, we go through a very extensive 
physical inventory of all of our space, for example. I mean, 
the book is about 4 inches thick. And we literally--every 
building, every room. And then we do an analysis of what 
portion of that room is dedicated to research, who funds that 
research, what portion of it is education, and so on and so 
forth. So we do the whole space analysis.
    Then we go through and we analyze all of our cost systems. 
We look at the HR system, we look at cost accounting, we look 
at the student records system, anything that is associated with 
any administration that touches research, including the 
library. We look at our debt service, the whole analysis of our 
so-called general ledger.
    That all goes into this massive amount of information that 
is then given to, in our case, the Department of Health and 
Human Services, the negotiators. And sometimes, frankly, it is 
a phone call, and after 30 minutes you say, ``Okay, well, here 
is what we have agreed to.'' And you think, ``Gee, we put all 
that work in it, and it just comes down to a phone call.'' Now, 
that is not an unusual circumstance, I think. But that is how 
the process plays out.
    And, in some cases, they will come and do a visit to your 
university. They will look it over in great detail. But if they 
have had some experience, some of the auditors, they come in 
and say, okay, yeah, we remember 2, 3, 4 years ago or whatever, 
we see that this is all consistent, so we will give you this 
rate, and it is over. Sometimes they will give you a 
provisional rate that goes for a few years and then they adjust 
it and so on.
    So it is as much of an art as it is a science, but it is 
based on rigorous analyses. And that is why, in my university, 
61.6 percent should be the actual rate. It is really negotiated 
to be 55 percent, so we lose to 6 percentage points, almost 7, 
in the negotiation process.
    It varies across the country. People have looked at this; 
the GAO has looked at this. Why is there different--you know, 
why is there a regional variability? Why is the ONR, in terms 
of how they do it, slightly different than HHS?
    Ms. DeLauro. Right.
    Mr. Droegemeier. So, as I think Dr. Gilliland mentioned, it 
is an imperfect process, for sure. And GAO just wrote a report 
a few months ago on this. So it constantly gets looked at, I 
think, in terms of the process.
    But I think it works pretty well, and it is getting better 
all the time. But it is a very laborious, time-intensive 
process.
    Ms. DeLauro. Right.
    And just very quickly, the opportunity for hiding, you 
know, a frivolous expense. You know, we went back all those 
years and talked about the yacht in San Francisco----
    Mr. Droegemeier. Right.
    Ms. DeLauro [continuing]. Whenever it was----
    Mr. Droegemeier. Right.
    Ms. DeLauro [continuing]. You know. But----
    Dr. Gilliland. Stanford.
    Mr. Yamamoto. Stanford.
    Mr. Droegemeier. Stanford.
    Ms. DeLauro. Stanford. Sorry.
    Mr. Droegemeier. Yeah, we are all quick to say who it was. 
Boy.
    Ms. DeLauro. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. Please. 
Yes. Right.
    It wasn't Connecticut, though, Dr. Liang, in any case.
    But is that--to the best possible--there is always the 
outlier, but is that--it is uncoverable if you are trying to--
--
    Mr. Droegemeier. Right. That is a great question. I put 
that very question to COGR. We heard COGR mentioned earlier. 
And what I was told was that, since that particular incident, 
there really have been no major findings.
    There was one university that had a $9,000,000 finding 
fairly recently, I guess, because they allowed research to be 
conducted in a building that should have been charged a 
different rate. It wasn't a fraudulent kind of thing. They went 
back and said, ``You know, you are right. It was in a building 
that was owned by the university, so it should have been just 
charged the administrative rate rather than the full F&amp;amp;A.''
    But, to their knowledge, that was the only, kind of, claim 
that had been found in the last 25 or so years. So I think the 
system is working pretty well in that regard.
    Ms. DeLauro. Okay.
    Does everybody concur, or is there----
    Dr. Liang. Yeah, I concur.
    Mr. Cole. I am just terrible at enforcing the clock today, 
but----
    Ms. DeLauro. You are.
    Mr. Cole  [contuinuing]. Okay.
    Dr. Liang. No, I don't really have anything more 
substantial to add. At UConn, we have a similar process, and 
there is no hidden illegitimate expenses.
    Ms. DeLauro. Uh-huh. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Cole. Absolutely.
    Mr. Simpson, I am prepared to be tougher on you.
    After we are established, we go in order. So we will just 
go right down the panel here.
    Mr. Simpson. I don't have any other questions, but to thank 
you for your work and stuff.
    And you said that you would lose $10,000,000 in overhead 
costs? You don't know where you get it? Let me suggest you get 
it out of the university football program so the rest of us 
could compete with you.
    Mr. Droegemeier. I have to tell you, that is a great point, 
and our football program actually gives several million dollars 
a year to the academic programs. It is one of the very few in 
the country that does that. But we are still looking for a 
national championship.
    Sorry. Sorry.
    Mr. Cole. Just think how much we could plow into research 
if we win the national title this year.
    I want to go next to my good friend, Dr. Harris.
    Mr. Harris. Thank you very much.
    And, again, thank you all for being here.
    And, you know, Dr. Gilliland, thanks for your honest 
testimony about applying for outside foundation money. The fact 
of the matter is they don't pay as much indirect costs. And 
that was your testimony, although earlier testimony was, 
``Yeah, they all pay about the same.'' They don't.
    And any researcher in the field knows that is why your 
first grant goes to the NIH. It doesn't go to the Gates 
Foundation, it doesn't go to American Heart, it doesn't go to 
American Cancer Society, it goes to the NIH, because the NIH is 
the most generous funder.
    So the question before us is not whether we are going to 
fund it but whether the amount we fund is an appropriate 
amount.
    And I will just make one observation, because I just sat 
here thinking about, now, how can we use indirect costs to 
actually fund young investigators or to encourage it. And I am 
thinking, you know, the senior investigators I knew, they had 
nice--they had their laboratories, but when they added the 
fourth and fifth project into that lab, there was minimal 
indirect cost added into that lab. The university really--I 
mean, it was just gravy for the university. That fourth and 
fifth grant was just gravy.
    So the GSI was kind of maybe a crude attempt to go after 
it. But what if we just said, you know, your third, fourth, and 
fifth grant, we are going to just get capped indirect costs--
because, you know, by the time you get to the third, fourth, 
fifth grant in a laboratory, you don't really have all those 
costs--and then turn that money over and fund more--and, again, 
because we are Congress, we can actually direct how the NIH 
funds money. We could direct them to spend those savings on 
funding young investigators. Doesn't that work?
    I mean, again, you are shaking your head. Because, look, I 
get it. Universities love that third, fourth, and fifth grant 
from the senior investigator. The question is, are we going to 
get our clock cleaned internationally because we are willing to 
say we need to fund that--and, look, I will agree with Mr. 
Simpson. I came from an institution; they built a Taj Mahal 
research building in the late 1990s. I mean, this was the most 
beautiful building. It was wonderful to do research in. It was 
beautiful. But you had to pay the costs for 20 or 30 years, 
however long the debt service was. And that gravy train didn't 
run forever.
    So my only comment is, I think we can think of ways, and we 
should be clever thinking of ways, that we can fund young 
investigators and turn that clock--because we have not turned 
it back. The Director of the NIH has said we have only 
plateaued it. We maybe have stopped the progress, but we have 
certainly not turned the clock back to funding young 
investigators.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Cole. Well, if somebody wants to make a response, I 
will certainly allow that.
    Mr. Harris. Absolutely.
    Dr. Liang. Thank you, Dr. Harris.
    One suggestion could be, which we are seeing more and more 
at UConn, is--we have those research millionaires, we call 
them, the many NIH grants. We have asked them to put young 
investigators as co-PI or multiple PI as a mechanism to get 
them supported under the supervision and tutelage of their more 
senior principal investigators.
    We actually think that is a better way to cultivate the 
next generation of young scientists, rather than capping the 
indirect costs, because I think that is really part of the 
overall cost. And we want to keep that by encouraging the young 
investigators to be multiple PI with the more senior ones as a 
way to grow the next generations of scientists.
    Dr. Gilliland. And I would only add to that, Dr. Harris, 
that, if you will recall the scoring system for the GSI, it 
actually penalized people that went in as co-PIs, that you got 
more points than you should if you had a single RO1 site.
    There are some fixes, potentially, in the ways we look at 
it, because I think Bruce is right, that you want to try to 
encourage senior investigators to mentor junior investigators 
in how you write a grant and how you put it together, and being 
co-PIs is a fantastic way to do that.
    Mr. Yamamoto. I want to just go back to the comments that 
Dr. Droegemeier so beautifully put forth in the beginning, and 
that is that--so, first of all, Dr. Harris, as you know, 
faculty members don't apply for NIH grants first because they 
give higher indirect costs or F&amp;amp;A; they apply for their NIH 
grants because that is where most of the money is.
    And so, to go back to this compact that has been made 
between the Federal Government and the economic research 
community, the power that that compact has had because the 
Federal Government has maintained that agreement and been loyal 
to it is just immeasurable. I mean, it is a huge impact.
    And so, yes, it is true that, at the outset, the Federal 
Government said, ``Yes, we need to contribute to this. We will 
do this on a cost-sharing basis.'' As I said, universities and 
research institutes are the second-highest funders of 
biomedical research, behind the NIH. So that compact has been 
maintained in a very powerful way.
    And so the fact that the government started with this 
principle that it is important to do this, make this kind of 
cost-sharing agreement, in order to drive forward the research 
endeavor, and the fact that foundations may not share that same 
commitment but, instead, are able to say, isn't it great that 
the Federal Government has done what it has done, that public 
funds have been made available in the way that they have been, 
that they have built this fantastic super-structure that is 
generating so much impact in our society, and so we are going 
to come in on top of that and be able to supplement it in that 
way.
    It is leveraging for every partner--for the foundations 
that are able to come in and support research in a building 
that has been put up in part with NIH funds and not have to do 
that themselves; certainly for the government that has made 
that commitment that now sees that there are commitments from 
private philanthropy, from industry in some cases, to be able 
to add on to that. Everybody is leveraging each other's 
efforts, and it is really because the NIH started in the way 
that it did.
    Mr. Cole. Thank you.
    Mr. Droegemeier. Could I just really quickly----
    Mr. Cole. Real quick.
    Mr. Droegemeier. I think your presumption is very 
reasonable, but I think, in fact, just the opposite happens. 
When a faculty member becomes a senior investigator and they 
get more and more grants, their lab actually grows. They hire 
post-docs, more students. They hire collaborators, researchers. 
Staff come in. And so it actually becomes more expensive to run 
their labs. It is not a steady state, where they get grant 
after grant and the sunk costs are already there. They are 
constantly growing their facilities, because they are senior 
and they are doing more research.
    So I think it is not that they have been there and done it 
and they are just in a steady state. No, they are actually 
increasing. Those costs never go away, because the acquisition 
of equipment, that is not an indirect cost; that is a direct 
cost.
    Mr. Cole. Thank you.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler.
    Ms. Herrera Beutler. My last question was kind of along--I 
think some of it has been answered, but I wanted to give Dr. 
Gilliland and anybody else, I guess, if you have maybe kind of 
a closing comment or something.
    Dr. Harris always brings up good questions, and we didn't 
always have enough time to have you respond, but it is helpful 
for me to see that exchange. And so, if there is something that 
maybe you didn't have a chance to cover, I am kind of just 
throwing it open.
    Or not.
    Mr. Cole. Wow. That is proof positive it has been a very 
thorough hearing, I guess.
    But I want to go to my friend, the ranking member, for any 
closing thoughts she might have.
    Ms. DeLauro. I appreciate that very, very much, Mr. 
Chairman.
    And I would like to just make reference, if I can--it is 
just a statement, no question--to Dr. Droegemeier's paper, 
which is really--you know, all the papers are great, don't 
misunderstand, but the history, for me, personally, was very, 
very informative.
    And we began by saying that virtually all research in 
higher education was funded either by philanthropy or private 
foundation. We then found that the institutions of higher 
education had no interest in receiving Federal funds for 
research owing to fears of government intrusion in curricular 
research topics and governance--always a fear.
    We then move to 1933, where we do say that, you know, the 
National Research Council, National Academy of Science involved 
in creating the concept of this partnership calmed the fears 
among academics that funding decisions would be made by experts 
and peers and not by bureaucrats.
    And 1940, Franklin Roosevelt, the direction he went, where 
the point was organizing and sponsoring academic and industrial 
research for national defense, which was the watershed moment, 
as you point out, the seed of a decades-long partnership, U.S. 
Government, U.S. higher education institutions in conducting 
research and development for the public good.
    What has been created here is the opportunity which has 
made us the leaders in the world in discovery and in saving 
lives. Above all, we need to preserve that decades-long 
partnership. We can fix around the edges. We cannot slash and 
burn what that has meant to date in the lives of the people of 
this country but, most importantly, what it means for the 
future of discovery based on science, not government intrusion 
in that process, in order to be able to safeguard the public 
and their lives.
    Thank you for what you do. Hold steadfast, my friends.
    Mr. Cole. Well, let me--I am not going to try and top that. 
My friend is a brilliant communicator. But I do want to begin 
by thanking all of you for being here. I thought this was an 
exceptionally thoughtful and, for this committee, a very, very 
informative process. So I really appreciate you taking your 
time out to come and travel a great distance for all of you, 
really, and to help educate us so we make decisions here.
    And I also want to make a couple other closing remarks. And 
I want to be careful how I say it, because I don't intend to be 
critical of the administration. This administration I support. 
I didn't support this particular proposal, but, broadly, I am 
supportive.
    But, you know, I have been around budgets a lot, and I used 
to help write budgets at the State level, and if you have been 
an appropriator, you deal with it. And, look, this really 
wasn't, in my view, originally from OMB, about getting more 
bang for the buck in research. If it were, you would have left 
the money the same and just lowered the reimbursement rate. 
Instead, we lowered the reimbursement rate, and we took the 
money and directed it someplace else.
    And we do that in budgets all the time. That is a 
reasonable thing to do. In this case, that money was directed 
towards defense, and I don't disagree with that. I disagree 
with this particular part of it, but I don't disagree with 
beefing up defense. I think it is actually something that has 
to be done. And I recognize they had very little time in which 
to work, and you are looking for savings where you can get 
them, and you have a priority, and so you are going to fund 
that priority.
    I will add for the record, it is interesting to notice they 
didn't propose this same 10-percent cap for defense research, 
which is at least as big as biomedical research. I mean, 
actually, if you look at this, they are pretty comparable, in 
terms of the cost ratio, what DOD does and what NIH does. So, 
if this is really true, then you would want to apply this to 
defense research as well as biomedical research out of NIH.
    And I would just urge--and I have had this discussion with 
my friends at OMB and with the administration. They need to 
look at NIH and Center for Disease Control like defense, too, 
because it just really is. You are much more likely to die in a 
pandemic than a terrorist attack.
    And I hope we don't have any terrorist attacks. I know 
every American hopes that. But I will guarantee you, in the 
next 4 years, there will be another Ebola, there will be 
another SARS, there will be another Zika. So maintaining a 
robust capability here at all times--because you can't create 
it overnight any more than you create a defense overnight--I 
think is really, really important for the security of the 
American people. And it is really important for us that we get 
this balance right.
    I know when I took this job and my counterpart over in the 
Senate, my good friend and our former colleague, Senator Blunt, 
we had seen in this area we had been flat-funded for a dozen 
years. And, you know, there is all this talk about setting 
goals, and Senator Blunt is a very wise guy. He said, you know, 
if you set a goal in government, like we are going to double 
it, then when you get there, you quit. And that is basically 
what happened the last time we did this.
    So we had a really good discussion, what should our goal 
be. And our goal should be sustainable investment over time, 
you know, something that is regular. And that is what we tried 
to do the last 2 years on a very bipartisan basis, I might add. 
Our friends, the Democrats, agree on this, as well. And that is 
what we are going to try and do if we are able to come to a 
larger agreement this year. And I think that is very important.
    Within that, I do think you are always looking for 
economies and savings. And, you know, I think Dr. Harris' 
contribution here is a real one, because this is a discussion 
that needs to be had.
    And I appreciate those of you that pointed out some of the 
administrative costs, that while we have kept your cap 
constant--again, I commend you, really, that 31-page, you know, 
miniature masterpiece, because it is really good. But look at 
the explosion in mandates while the costs stayed the same. And 
that is actually an area I think we can all come together on.
    And as a number of you pointed out in your testimony, we 
have studies underway. Our friends on Energy and Commerce have 
done some really good work on this in 21st Century Cures. And 
we need to do that, because we do have very restricted 
resources. I mean, we do have a budget deficit that is 
beginning to move the wrong way because we won't do entitlement 
stuff, and that is going to crowd out all of these type things 
where there is defense on one side of the discretionary ledger 
or it is biomedical research on the other. These are important 
national priorities too. Everything can't just be Social 
Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and the remaining entitlement 
programs. That is 70 percent of our budget now. So, sooner or 
later, we are going to have to go there.
    But these investments really do save lives. And this 
partnership--and I really appreciate all of you that talked 
about that. Because, you know, as Dr. Yamamoto said toward the 
end, look, we all leverage one another's money in this, and 
that is one of the reasons why it has been so productive. It is 
productive for philanthropy and private enterprise. It is 
productive for the Federal Government. We don't have to go out 
and build the labs; you guys have already done it. You know, 
your taxpayers or your contributors or your donors have ponied 
up for part of the cost of what is really important national 
work.
    So I just want to make sure as we go forward that we don't 
throw out the baby with the bath water, you know, looking for 
savings and disrupting what is really a pretty complex, now-70-
year-old ecosystem that has produced extraordinary benefits for 
the American people and extraordinary benefits, to be quite 
frank, for all of mankind. This is one of America's great 
contributions to humanity. A lot of the cures that are found 
here don't stay here. Thank goodness, they go all over the 
world, and they help lots of folks that aren't fortunate enough 
to have the resources that this country has been able to 
generate, both financial and intellectual, to actually do this 
kind of work.
    So thank you for coming here. It is amazingly helpful to us 
to get your testimony and benefit from the insights of a 
lifetime that each of you have dedicated to research and each 
of you have dedicated to making life better, frankly, for your 
fellow Americans and for all of humanity. So we very much 
appreciate you being here.
    And, with that, we are closed.
