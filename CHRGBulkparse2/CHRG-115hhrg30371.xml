    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF DAVID P. ROE, CHAIRMAN&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Good evening, everyone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;Thank you for being
here tonight at this nighttime hearing. As you all know, I try 
to limit these late evenings but I cannot imagine a topic more 
worthy of our attention than ensuring that veterans have the 
education benefits they have earned and deserve.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;I am proud and excited that we are all here to discuss H.R. 
3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act 
of 2017, which the Ranking Member and I introduced last 
Thursday with the support of every single Member of this 
Committee. H.R. 3218 and how we got here and where we are today 
is a shining example of how well Congress can and should work 
together.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;This bill is the result of the tireless work of many of the 
VSOs here tonight and the bipartisan efforts of this Committee. 
And I am proud of what we will empower servicemembers, 
veterans, survivors, and dependents to achieve with the 
improvements and enhancements included in this bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;This is the first major improvement to the G.I. Bill since 
2011 and it encompasses 17 bills introduced by our colleagues, 
many of whom serve on this Committee, but also Members of this 
body who share this Committee's commitment to the men and women 
who serve. This package includes over 28 provisions and brings 
forward countless enhancements that veterans groups have 
requested for years. This is not a package that comes along 
every day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;H.R. 3218 has been aptly named after Mr. Harry W. Colmery, 
who is credited with actually writing by hand the first draft 
of the World War II era G.I. Bill. It is appropriate that we 
honor him for his work on this first G.I. Bill decades ago.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;Tonight's package will do a number of things but I want to 
focus on a couple of key improvements. It would eliminate the 
15-year time limit to use G.I. Bill benefits for future 
eligible beneficiaries. Let me repeat that. For the first time 
in the history of the G.I. Bill future beneficiaries will be 
able to carry these benefits with them throughout their lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;The bill would provide significant increases in G.I. Bill 
funding for Reservists and Guardsmen, including those who are 
currently serving on orders that do not accrue G.I. Bill 
eligibility, as well as dependents, surviving spouses, and 
surviving dependents; provide 100 percent G.I. Bill eligibility 
for Post-9/11 Purple Heart recipients; and increase 
opportunities for veterans to complete a STEM degree or other 
high technology programs, something I know Leader McCarthy has 
advocated for. And it is a privilege to have him join us here 
tonight.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;The provisions I just mentioned only scratch the surface of 
the benefits that our veterans and survivors will receive under 
this bill. I am also proud that my bill, H.R. 1956, the Caring 
for Families of our Wounded and Fallen Heroes Act, is included 
in this package. This bill would provide additional $200 per 
month in education benefits to surviving spouses and children, 
those of whom do not qualify for the Fry Scholarship. These 
individuals understand all too well what it means to make the 
ultimate sacrifice and it is our duty and honor to provide for 
them as best we can.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;Before I yield to the Ranking Member, I would be remiss if 
I did not give my sincere thanks to the veterans groups, 
especially Student Veterans of America, for helping us make 
this happen. We owe a debt of gratitude to all the veterans' 
service organizations who pushed for this package and stuck it 
out with us every step of this long process while we worked to 
make this the best bill it can be. I commend and thank you 
because we without a doubt would not be sitting here on the 
verge of this historic moment without your efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="The Chairman. Good evening, everyone"&gt;    I now turn it over to Ranking Member Walz for his 
statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Well thank you, Chairman Roe. This really is a
great night. I think sometimes patting ourselves on the back 
for things, you should not be thanked for what you are supposed 
to do. But I think it is important to understand that 
legislating is never supposed to be easy. And this Committee 
again has proven that we can come together if the goal is a 
unified desire to see the best care and the honoring of our 
commitment to our veterans. And that has happened.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;I also think the way we do business in here, and this is a 
testament to Chairman Roe's leadership, we need to conduct 
ourselves in a manner that is befitting of the sacrifice of 
those who serve in uniform to allow us to self-govern. And this 
Committee comes together. We differ on issues but we do it in a 
manner that is befitting of that. So I am grateful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;I too would like to thank all the Members of this Committee 
who have put in hard work. Many of their ideas are incorporated 
into this bill. Those veterans' service organizations, as 
mentioned Student Veterans of America, I kind of heard someone 
said they are the new kids on the block. If that is true they 
are pretty quick learners. And they are pretty good at getting 
things done and I am grateful for that. To the American Legion, 
the VFW, and IAVA, once again, holding true to the Vietnam 
Veterans' mantra that one generation of veterans will never 
forget another. I think this is multi-generational in how this 
bill impacts people, so I am grateful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;To our witnesses today, to the Ranking Member, thank you 
for your active engagement in veteran's issues. Thank you to 
Mr. McCarthy for making this a priority, saying it, and 
following through with actions. We are grateful for that. 
Colonel Cook, as always, welcome back here. You did much good 
sitting on this Committee and you continue to do so. So, we are 
glad to have you here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The Chairman mentioned some of the highlights. I would just 
like to thank the Forever Bill, also the name that may stick a 
little bit to this too, is lifting that 15-year gap, 
understanding the reality of what modern warriors look like and 
what it involves to serve this Nation in uniform, whether 
active or in Reserve. It is just smart policy. Honoring those 
Purple Heart recipients, just again smart. And I want to thank 
Mr. Peters for his continuous, since he has been in Congress, 
making sure that they are honored for their commitment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;And I would also like to say the Guard and Reserve Caucus, 
Mr. Palazzo, my co-chair in that, and all of us who have Guard 
and Reserve soldiers, the issue of the 12304(b) of the call-ups 
under Title 10, that basically created a second class of 
warriors that were out there. I have to tell you, this happened 
on Thursday night. Saturday I was at a welcome back ceremony 
for the 2nd of the 135, the Red Bulls, who have been doing the 
Sinai Mission. And they had not yet heard this. And to tell 
them that they are going to be restored and have their benefits 
that they had earned was just something to behold, to see. And 
the thing that I heard afterwards is working on this together 
for us really means something. It means that, you know, the 
sacrifice and what they did there does show that it matters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;    So thank you all. We have got a little bit of a lift yet. 
We would hope our Senate colleagues will follow our lead, take 
this thing, move it through. And I know the President wants to 
sign this. And I am grateful and once again to the leadership 
for putting this on the calendar, which I think is almost 
unprecedented in guaranteeing us to get this to the floor. On 
behalf of our Nation's veterans, thank you, Mr. Leader. I yield 
back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding&lt;/speaker&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE KEVIN MCCARTHY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HONORABLE KEVIN MCCARTHY"&gt; Before I
yield to the Committee Members for the provisions included in 
the package, I want to recognize Majority Leader McCarthy for 
five minutes to discuss his provision as included in this bill. 
You are now recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McCarthy&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and all
Committee staff. I want to thank you for the opportunity to 
present to you and say a few words in support of the G.I. Bill 
reforms that this Committee will take up this week.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;First Mr. Chairman and to all Committee Members, I want to 
begin by recognizing the positive work that this Committee has 
achieved. This Committee has shown time and again on a 
bipartisan way on how to govern. It is an example for all 
Members and all of our colleagues. You will continue to work on 
a bipartisan basis and lead Congress to deliver on the duty to 
provide veterans better health care and positive post-service 
opportunities. The dynamic here is a model for all of our 
colleagues, as I said, and I look forward to continuing to work 
together on behalf of the men and women who protect and serve 
this country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;Now chief among the promises we make to the men and women 
who serve is to give them support and resources to obtain an 
education after service. That is the reason why many will at 
times even sign up. Applying the lessons they learn in the 
service to the lessons taught in the classroom is an enrichment 
opportunity that our society benefits from greatly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;Now the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill has long helped countless 
veterans in educational and career pursuits. But today we are 
on the brink of vast career and work transformation. The rise 
of artificial intelligence and robotics are upending how jobs 
are performed and we have traditionally known them in the past. 
But as we saw with the advent of the ATM, this disruption has 
promised to be a job creator, not a destroyer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;The challenge before us is securing the right response for 
Americans to get ahead and take advantage of the changes. Now 
news reports have shown and highlighted the skills gap in 
today's workforce. If we just look at the AP headline on the 
May jobs report, it was concise. Jobs data could signal a 
shortage of qualified workers to hire. By 2024 the tech 
industry is expected to add almost 500,000 new jobs to the 
industry. However, many tech employers are looking for 
candidates who have a particular skill set that candidates 
often do not learn in traditional settings. Consequently 
industry employers have turned to non-traditional programs like 
boot camps, nanodegrees, and coding schools to find candidates 
with the necessary skill set.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;The traditional career path is no longer a straight shot. 
These non-traditional technology education models are just part 
of the solution to closing the skill gap. Just ask Alphabet, 
Microsoft, Amazon, Ford, GE, or any other of American's great 
companies and they will tell you of the promise these non-
traditional models hold.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;But currently veterans are unable to apply their G.I. 
education benefits to these courses. My provision in this 
legislation creates a pilot program to provide veterans the 
opportunity and ability to take advantage of these education 
opportunities. Veterans are prime candidates for tech positions 
because of our military discipline, ability to work under 
pressure, and teamwork. Many veterans often learn skills during 
their service and training that could be applied to the tech 
industry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;The Vet Tech Act enables veterans to enroll in non-
traditional technology courses and programs that are geared to 
getting a job after completion. The provision also provides the 
VA the necessary flexibility to approve these education 
programs while also guarding against abuses. These reforms the 
Committee will consider this week will have a positive impact 
felt by the veterans returning to civilian life. This impact 
will be lifelong. And with the renewed commitment to a career 
preparation, particularly in the technology industry, American 
industry and our veterans stand to lead in the 21st Century.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;I happen to serve in California. I look time and again at 
the number of jobs that are being hired. I look at the number 
of tech education that are helping change with nanodegrees, the 
skill set for the individuals to be able to be there. But when 
I go to them and I meet with veterans and I know their 
background, I know their education, and I know their knowledge 
of what they served when they served in the military, not to be 
able to use a G.I. Bill to get a nanodegree to be hired by some 
of the top companies in this country that are craving them, I 
think it is a travesty and I think it is something that has to 
change.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. McCarthy"&gt;    That is why I thank you for your work and the work you will 
do this week and I look forward to putting it on the floor and 
getting it done in the next week. And I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank you, Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="The Chairman. I thank you, Mr"&gt;McCarthy. And I appreciate
your passion for this and I appreciate your support for forward 
this bill next week. And I know you have places to be so you 
are now excused. Thank you for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE MARK TAKANO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HONORABLE MARK TAKANO"&gt;    Before we recognize our other colleagues at the witness 
table, I will recognize Committee Members who have provisions 
included in H.R. 3218. Mr. Takano, let us start with you. You 
are recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Takano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Takano"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to join my
colleagues in expressing support for this bipartisan effort to 
secure the G.I. Bill for future generations of veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Takano"&gt;The G.I. Bill serves two critical functions. First it is a 
powerful tool for recruiting talented young people into 
military service. As we approach our 16th year of war, 
replenishing our all-volunteer military with patriotic and 
qualified Americans is vital to our mission abroad and our 
safety here at home.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Takano"&gt;Second, the G.I. Bill ensures that veterans return home to 
more than just a thank you and a pat on the back. It ensures 
they are given the opportunity to build a rewarding, 
purposeful, and prosperous civilian life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Takano"&gt;This legislation guarantees that the G.I. Bill will 
continue both of these functions for decades to come. And 
importantly, it does so without cutting benefits from anyone 
who is currently serving.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Takano"&gt;I want to echo many of the supportive comments we have 
heard this evening and over the last week from Members of 
Congress, as well as the veteran's service organizations that 
play an important role in representing the veteran's community. 
The removal of time restrictions for future G.I. Bill 
recipients, the deserved increases in funding for Reservists 
and Guardsmen, and the additional educational support for 
veterans' families, are all features of this legislation that 
are worth celebrating.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Takano"&gt;This bill also incorporates my proposal to permanently 
authorize VA's work-study allowance program and my proposal to 
end the unequal treatment of Reservists and Guardsmen. This 
legislation gives them the same ability as Active duty 
servicemembers to accrue G.I. Bill benefits when they are 
ordered into Active duty to receive medical care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Takano"&gt;But I want to focus my comments on one piece of this 
legislative package that represents a major step forward for 
student veterans. For far too long swarm of predatory, for-
profit schools have exploited the generosity of the G.I. Bill 
and have cheated thousands of veterans out of the education and 
the future they deserve. A 2014 Senate HELP Committee study 
found that eight of the top ten schools receiving Post-9/11 
G.I. Bill money were for-profit institutions. At the time, 
seven of those eight schools were under investigation for 
unethical business practices, including the now defunct ITT 
Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges. From 2009 to 2015, 
these two schools collected more than $1 billion in veteran's 
benefits. I am pleased that this bill provides relief to the 
thousands of student veterans who were left with non-
transferable credits and a depleted G.I. Bill benefit when 
their school abruptly closes in the middle of a semester. 
Restoring both tuition and housing benefits to these veterans 
for a semester cut short by a school closure is simply the 
right thing to do. And by making this provision retroactive we 
are restoring a measure of justice for the students at ITT Tech 
and Corinthian, as well as others across the country who have 
been left out in the cold by a college that shuts down without 
warning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Takano"&gt;I have advocated for this provision since my first days in 
Congress and I truly appreciate Chairman Roe's and Ranking 
Member Walz' work to include it in this bill. However, this 
bill does not solve the problem of unethical schools preying on 
veterans' benefits. In fact, its inclusion is evidence that 
much more needs to be done so that veterans are never forced to 
seek this type of relief in the first place. The 90/10 
loophole, which allows for-profit schools to count G.I. Bill 
benefits as private funding instead of Federal funding, 
continues to incentivize aggressive recruitment of student 
veterans. That loophole still needs to be addressed. The 
gainful employment borrower defense rules, which the Trump 
administration has put on hold, would finally establish 
oversight and accountability for unethical schools. Those rules 
still need to be implemented. As long as these issues remain 
unresolved, bad actors in the for-profit education industry 
will continue to defraud student veterans and taxpayers out of 
billions of dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Takano"&gt;    I look forward to working with my colleagues to build on 
the progress we have made on this issue. Though there is no 
question that we still have significant work ahead of us to 
address the challenges facing the veteran's community, but this 
legislation is a milestone worth celebrating and certainly 
worth passing into law. The collaborative nature of this bill 
reflects the spirit of bipartisanship that has made this 
Committee so effective over the past several months. Once 
again, I applaud the Chairman and the Ranking Member for their 
leadership, as well as my colleagues on the Committee who 
contributed to the strength of this legislation. I encourage 
all Members to support this bill and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Bilirakis, you are 
recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I
want to thank the Ranking Member as well. I would like to thank 
my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for all their hard 
work in drafting this important and bipartisan piece of 
legislation. And I really appreciate, Mr. Chairman, you giving 
us the opportunity to testify on behalf of our provisions 
tonight. I really appreciate it. It is very good for the public 
and our veterans to know what is in the bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;I am proud of the work we have done this year to ensure 
that we as a Nation take care of our veterans when they return 
home. But there is always more work to be done for these 
honorable Americans. The brave men and women of our U.S. armed 
forces have answered the call to protect the liberties we enjoy 
on a daily basis. We must answer the call to help our veterans 
in return.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;The challenges our Nation's heroes face do not end on the 
battlefield but continue as they make their transition to 
civilian life. We must find viable ways to improve both the 
effectiveness and delivery of transition resources. In order to 
give the best opportunities to our veterans, we must be 
prepared to address new needs as they are identified. And we 
are doing that in this Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;I am very pleased my legislation, H.R. 1994, the Veteran 
Act, was included in the overall bill we are discussing today. 
My provision will make necessary investments to the information 
technology systems of the Veterans Benefits Administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;First, it requires all original and supplemental claims for 
educational assistance to be done electronically. That makes 
sense. This will ensure that veterans are able to receive 
benefits in a more timely and efficient manner. The provision 
would authorize $30 million to help the VA carry out the 
mission of assisting our veterans and getting an education and 
transitioning back to civilian life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will be required to 
submit to Congress a plan to implement proposed changes and 
improvements within 180 days of its enactment. The plan will 
ensure that this Committee has the necessary information to 
perform its oversight duties. After a year of implementing the 
changes, the VA Secretary will also be required to submit a 
report giving the Committee an update on what is working and 
what is not working so that we can fix it. This will provide 
the Committee with the information necessary to continue to 
improve of course how we serve our Nation's heroes. Overall 
this section will modernize the G.I. Bill claims processing and 
help streamline the system for veterans to receive their 
educational benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I have a letter of support for my bill, the 
Veteran Act, that is included, again from the Association of 
the United States Navy, which I would like to ask unanimous 
consent to include for the record.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered"&gt;

remain dedicated to ensuring that our Nation's veterans have 
access to the important educational benefits they have earned 
and deserve. We have a responsibility to make sure our veterans 
are fully prepared with the skills, resources, and education 
they need to thrive in civilian life. I urge my colleagues to 
support this beneficial piece of legislation and I yield back 
the balance of my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE SCOTT PETERS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HONORABLE SCOTT PETERS"&gt; Mr.
Peters, thank you. You are now recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I do
appreciate the chance to take a quick second to speak about my 
bill that is included in this package. The bill would extend 
full education benefits to honorably discharged Purple Heart 
recipients, regardless of their length of service.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;As you all know, G.I. benefits are based on a rating system 
and you need 36 months of Active duty to qualify for 100 
percent benefits. One out of every five Purple Heart vets from 
the War on Terror who is using G.I. benefits does not qualify 
for the full rating. And others are discouraged from pursuing 
an education at all because their benefit does not cover the 
full cost of enrollment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;This includes veterans like Marine Corps Sergeant Adrian 
Aranda, whose squad was hit by a landmine outside of Kandahar 
Airport in Afghanistan just three months after the 9/11 
attacks. He sustained burns, shrapnel damage to the left side 
of his body, a broken hand, hearing damage, and a traumatic 
brain injury. Sergeant Aranda and his squad mates were the 
first servicemembers to receive Purple Hearts in the War on 
Terrorism.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;After his service Sergeant Aranda went on to earn an 
Associate Degree from a community college and then graduated 
with a Bachelor's from Texas Tech. And while pursuing his 
education he discovered that he only qualified for a 50 percent 
rating for his educational benefits despite being severely 
wounded in the line of duty. We made a promise to the veterans 
who rushed to serve their country after 9/11 that we would 
honor their sacrifice and stand by them when they returned. It 
is wrong that we would exclude veterans, like Sergeant Aranda, 
who suffered life-changing injuries fighting for this country 
from receiving full education benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;By including my Purple Heart bill we are going help an 
estimated 660 Purple Heart recipients per year pursue a college 
degree or vocational training so they can land a good job and 
make the peaceful, prosperous transition to civilian life they 
deserve. In our time of greatest need, these brave 
servicemembers fought and bled for us. They do not just deserve 
these benefits. Just like their Purple Heart medals, they have 
earned them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;    Thank you to Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz. I agree 
with Mr. McCarthy on this, this is an exemplar of 
bipartisanship for the rest of the Congress. It is a pleasure 
to work on this Committee. I want to thank the entire Committee 
and Committee staff, and the VSOs, especially in this case the 
Military Order of the Purple Heart, for working with us to 
include this as part of the Forever G.I. Bill. And I yield 
back.

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE MIKE COFFMAN&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HONORABLE MIKE COFFMAN"&gt; Peters, for yielding, and
those kind remarks. Mr. Coffman, you are now recognized for 
five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Coffman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Coffman"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for
holding this hearing tonight and for including my legislation 
in the Veterans Education Assistance Act. Having earned an 
undergraduate degree at the University of Colorado under the 
Vietnam era G.I. Bill, I fully understand the importance of 
this benefit to our veterans and to our Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Coffman"&gt;My legislation, H.R. 2549, the G.I. Bill Processing 
Improvement Act, which I introduced with Congressman O'Rourke, 
would ensure those receiving G.I. benefits for their military 
service do so in a more timely manner. It also improves 
oversight of schools and educational facilities who receive VA 
funding for requiring them to certify the G.I. Bill funds 
received are in fact used for veteran's services. Lastly, my 
legislation would require that school certifying officials, 
SCOs, are properly equipped to better counsel veterans on 
academic courses and their financial benefits by requiring more 
transparency and efficiency from our academic institutions 
serving our Nation's veterans. We ensure our veterans use their 
G.I. Bill benefits to realize their full potential.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Coffman"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I am also proud to be an original co-sponsor 
of this larger G.I. Bill reform effort. The Veterans Education 
Assistance Act includes many life-changing provisions, such as 
a lifetime benefit of the G.I. Bill and an additional nine 
months for G.I. Bill eligibility when pursuing a STEM degree, 
protection of G.I. Bill benefits for veterans impacted by a 
school closure, and make it easier for veterans to use their 
G.I. Bill for tests that lead to a license or a credential.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Coffman"&gt;Mr. Chairman, it is important that this Committee make a 
veteran's transition as seamless and rewarding as possible. And 
the Veterans Educational Assistance Act does exactly that. I 
look forward to continue working with you to make sure we can 
deliver, you and the Ranking Member, sorry Major Walz, a G.I. 
Bill that is worthy of the service and sacrifice that those 
fighting for our Nation have shown.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Coffman"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the remainder of my 
time.

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE BRAD WENSTRUP&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HONORABLE BRAD WENSTRUP"&gt; Dr.
Wenstrup, you are now recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Wenstrup&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be
an original co-sponsor of H.R. 3218, the Harry W. Colmery 
Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. And I am thrilled 
that the legislation I introduced to expand benefits to our 
military's Reserve and Guard components is included as a 
provision. This provision, which I introduced as Guard and 
Reservist Education Improvement Act, would enhance the amount 
of G.I. Bill eligibility for servicemembers who do not serve 
enough time to receive 100 percent of the benefit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;So currently servicemembers who serve at least between 
three to six months and six months to less than 12 months of 
Active duty service can qualify for 40 and 50 percent of the 
full G.I. Bill benefits respectively. What this provision would 
do, it would increase these benefits to 50 percent and 60 
percent respectively, which for students attending a private 
school would result in approximately $2,300 more a year in 
tuition than they are receiving now, and would receive even 
more money for their housing allowance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;The brave citizen soldiers in the Reserve component and the 
Guard, of which more than a million have been mobilized since 
9/11, contribute greatly to the end strength of our armed 
forces. And they often have to juggle careers, families, and 
the service to our great Nation. We must do all that we can to 
support those who put their lives on the line for our great 
Nation and easier access to an earned education benefit is 
critical.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;The underlying bill goes far to accomplish this goal, 
increasingly accessibility to the educational opportunities 
that the G.I. Bill provides helps ensure the men and women who 
have worn this Nation's uniform receive the benefits they have 
earned and are equipped with the education they need to be 
successful. And our veterans have a high success rate in 
education. So I am proud to support these initiatives and these 
much needed improvements, many of which originated from 
veterans themselves and through the VSOs. And I thank my 
colleagues on this Committee for their willingness and 
commitment to forge a path forward on a bipartisan basis to get 
things done.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE JOHN RUTHERFORD&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HONORABLE JOHN RUTHERFORD"&gt; Mr.
Rutherford, you are recognized now for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rutherford&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;Good evening, Chairman Roe, and Ranking
Member Walz, and the rest of the Committee. I want to thank you 
for this opportunity to testify on behalf of the Julian Woods 
Yellow Ribbon Program Expansion Act, which has been included in 
Section 108 of H.R. 3218.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;In my time as a Member on this Committee, I have been 
encouraged by our work to improve the lives of our 
servicemembers and their families. Almost every day we hear 
about new ways we can enhance the assistance our servicemembers 
and their families receive. And I believe as you do that it is 
very important that we seriously take recommendations under 
consideration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;One component of these benefits focuses on the educational 
success of these selfless men and women. The Marine Gunnery 
Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship currently pays a benefit 
equal to the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill to the children and surviving 
spouses of servicemembers who die in the line of duty. Eligible 
recipients are entitled to 36 months of benefits at the 100 
percent level. They receive a monthly living stipend and book 
allowance. Roughly 6,000 surviving dependents and spouses of 
those who died serving their country rely on this scholarship 
to cover their educational expenses. And as anyone who has sent 
a child or a loved one to school recently knows, college is 
incredibly expensive. The current benefit payment of the Post-
9/11 G.I. Bill is roughly $23,000 a year, which covers most of 
the institutions. Though not the intent of the law this cap 
places financial restrictions on prospective students that have 
suffered the hardship of losing a loved one.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;For servicemembers on the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill this is where 
the Yellow Ribbon Program comes in to help. Under the Yellow 
Ribbon Program degree granting institutions of higher learning 
may choose to make additional funds available if the cost of 
attendance is above the cap that is set by the Post-9/11 G.I. 
Bill. These institutions voluntarily enter into an agreement 
with the VA at no additional cost to the servicemember's G.I. 
Bill privilege and the VA matches that amount to help cover the 
additional cost. Hundreds of institutions participate in this 
program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;Under current law, however, those on the Fry Scholarship 
are not eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program. This means that 
the surviving spouses and children of those who have died in 
the line of duty are limited in their ability to choose the 
institution of higher learning that would best help them 
succeed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;Section 108 is simple yet impactful. It would extend the 
Yellow Ribbon Program to those on the Fry Scholarship. I 
believe that when we empower the Members of our servicemen and 
women, both fallen and surviving, we strengthen our 
communities, we embolden our institutions, and we reinvigorate 
our future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;Upon introduction of this bill, I was reminded of Petty 
Officer 3rd Class Julian Woods, a Jacksonville native killed in 
action in Fallujah during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004. 
Petty Officer Woods was a hospital corpsman killed by enemy 
fire as he rushed to aid a fallen soldier. When I introduced 
H.R. 2103 I spoke with Julian's mother, Carolyn. She told me 
that any work that we do to ease the mind of any person who 
either served or lost someone they loved in the line of duty is 
of incredible importance. I agree with her and I want to do 
everything that we can to ease the burden of those who have 
lost a loved one, including the Petty Officer's only daughter. 
His loss was a tragedy for his family, his daughter, our 
community, and our Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;    I thank the Chairman, the Ranking Member, and the VSOs, and 
the Committee staff for working together on this vital piece of 
bipartisan legislation. And I look forward to working with you 
all to move it forward. I yield back the balance of my time.

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE JIM BANKS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HONORABLE JIM BANKS"&gt; Rutherford, for that
compelling testimony. Mr. Banks, you are now recognized for 
five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Banks&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Banks"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We all obviously agree
on the importance of economic opportunity and skills 
acquisition for our veterans. Helping our veterans not just 
afford an education but also to maneuver the transition from 
servicemember to student is one of the best ways that we can 
help our veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Banks"&gt;Since 2009 the VA has operated a pilot program called Vet 
Success on Campus, or VSOC, which helps veterans, 
servicemembers, and their families succeed on campus by 
providing educational and vocational counseling services. These 
services are provided through a vocational rehabilitation 
counselor who works with student veterans to ensure they reach 
both their educational and career goals. This includes 
equipping them with the knowledge on how to effectively use the 
G.I. Bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Banks"&gt;The pilot program began in 2009 and since then it has 
expanded to 94 campuses across the country. In March, I 
introduced legislation that would make this a permanent program 
authorized by statute. The text of the bill has since been 
included in the bill we are discussing today, H.R. 3218, along 
with many other important reforms for our student veterans. For 
that, I am very grateful on behalf of the thousands of veterans 
on college campuses all over the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Banks"&gt;    With that, Mr. Chairman, and with over three and a half

minutes left, I yield back.
gentleman for that. I thank all of my colleagues and with us 
today at the witness table we have our colleagues, Colonel Paul 
Cook of California, a former Member of the Committee, and Luke 
Messer of Indiana, a policy chair on the Republican side. Thank 
you for being here tonight, introducing bills we included in 
the package. Mr. Messer, you are now recognized for five 
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Messer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Messer"&gt;Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I did not know I
would be first. First I want to thank you for your leadership, 
and your commitment to veterans, and your help with me today as 
we worked through this legislation on this bill. I want to 
thank all the Members of the Committee for the important work 
that you do. And I do have to give a slight shout out to my 
colleague from the great Hoosier State and appreciate his 
leadership, Mr. Banks, and all you do for the Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Messer"&gt;I also wanted to thank you for including my proposal in 
this legislation to help veterans impacted by the closure of 
ITT Tech in this bipartisan G.I. Bill reform package. When 
Indiana based ITT Technical Institute abruptly closed its 
doors, 40,000 students nationwide, including 7,000 veterans, 
were left high and dry. Thankfully help came for some. If a 
student attended ITT Tech through a Pell Grant, they had that 
Pell Grant restored. And if they took out a Federal loan, the 
loan was forgiven. But nothing has been done for the student 
veterans who used their G.I. Bill benefits to attend ITT Tech. 
Frankly, our veterans got a raw deal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Messer"&gt;Jason Nicos, a U.S. Navy veteran from Greenfield, Indiana 
in my district, had to start his degree completely from scratch 
after spending two years at ITT Tech. Not a single credit 
transferred and his G.I. Bill is going to run out before he can 
finish a new degree. He told my office, ``to spend two years of 
my life at a place with nothing to show for it is one of the 
biggest disappointments I have ever experienced.'' And Jason's 
story is sadly one of thousands. It is not fair that these 
veterans would lose their G.I. benefits through no fault of 
their own. They deserve better. My proposal restores G.I. Bill 
benefits to veterans who were attending ITT Tech when it closed 
so that they can finish their degree elsewhere. It also helps 
veterans who may be impacted by a school closure in the future. 
Our servicemen and women count on G.I. Bill benefits to help 
them start a career and build a life after serving our country. 
The least we can do is to make sure they get that chance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Messer"&gt;    Thank you, Chairman, again, and thank your staff for 
working with us on this critical issue. And I yield back the 
two minutes and 30 seconds of my time.

working with us on this critical issue. And I yield back the

of us, as Mr. Walz pointed out, in Congress may spend two years 
and accomplish absolutely nothing either. So we are glad this 
is something that was overlooked and should be taken care of. 
And I am really, really pleased that these students are going 
to be able to get their time back and be able to go on with 
their lives. Colonel, you are now recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cook&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First I want to thank
you and Ranking Member Walz for including my bill, H.R. 245, 
the Veterans Education Equity Act, as part of the larger G.I. 
Bill reforms.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;As a veteran and college professor, serving veterans and 
ensuring an affordable path to higher education have always 
been high priorities. The G.I. Bill addresses these two 
critical issues and has been a huge success in helping millions 
of veterans get an education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;By the way, I want to correct the record in that Mr. 
Poliquin has been spreading a rumor that I was a veteran of the 
Revolutionary War. And I just wanted to make sure that was 
included.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;One part of the G.I. Bill is the basic allowance for 
housing, a monthly stipend that assists veterans with living 
expenses while in school. Unfortunately the current formula 
prevents some veterans from receiving a fair housing payment 
based on their true cost of living or housing. Currently the 
basic allowance for housing payment is based on the zip code 
where the veteran's school is headquartered rather than the zip 
code where the veteran attends classes. This policy results in 
a monthly payment that sometimes fails to cover basic housing 
needs or far exceeds the cost of living in certain areas. It 
also places school headquarters in lower income zip codes at a 
recruiting disadvantage because they offer student veterans a 
much lower monthly payment than satellite campuses of schools 
headquartered in more expensive areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;In the Morongo Basin, which is the home to the Marine Corps 
Air Ground Combat Center, and I might add that one of the 
Members of your Committee formerly served in that area where I 
live, many of the veterans utilizing the basic housing 
allowance are adversely affected by the current payout formula.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;Take for example, one community college is located and 
headquartered in Joshua Tree, California, a low-cost area, and 
a second one is headquartered in Orange County, California, a 
very expensive area, but offers classes at satellite facilities 
in the Morongo Basin. Because the current basic allowance for 
housing payment is calculated based on the zip code where the 
college is headquartered, veterans in the Morongo Basin taking 
classes from the Orange County-based college receive as much as 
a thousand dollars more per month than students taking classes 
at the locally headquartered community college.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;These are students living in the same community with the 
same housing costs, but one student receives significantly more 
money than the other student. This not only effectively 
subsidizes some school at the expense of others, but also 
wastes valuable taxpayer dollars that should be spent on 
educating our veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;In other communities, the reverse is true. Satellite 
campuses that are headquartered in less expensive communities 
can leave student veterans without sufficient funds to cover 
their housing needs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;The Veterans Education Equality Act fixes this discrepancy 
by calculating the basic allowance for housing payments based 
on where the student attends classes, not where the institution 
of higher learning is headquartered. This bill ensures veterans 
receive an adequate and fair housing allowance while 
eliminating a source of abuse in the program. It will ensure 
that veterans receive payments that meet their true costs of 
housing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz, I want to thank you 
both again for including my bill in the Harry Colmery Veterans 
Educational Assistance Act of 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Cook"&gt;I have 15 seconds and I want to also add that to the time 
left on it, and I talked longer than most people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Coy&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;Good evening, Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz,
and distinguished Members of the Committee, and particularly 
those Members of the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss 
legislation pertaining to the Department of Veterans Affairs 
programs. Perhaps more importantly, thank you for your 
passionate interest in our student veterans. It is an honor to 
be here to represent VA and those individuals who work hard 
every day to deliver those benefits veterans have earned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;And if I may, we would also like to again compliment the 
Committee staff for their professionalism, hard work, and 
passion to assist veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;Accompanying me today is James Ruhlman, Deputy Director of 
our Education Service.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;As we reviewed the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational 
Assistance Act of 2017, we are encouraged by the number of 
sections aimed at improving educational opportunities for 
veterans and their beneficiaries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;When I testified at the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee 
on many of the same proposed legislative actions, I said the 
Post-9/11 GI Bill is truly transformative.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;In a recent talk I gave, I indicated that the original GI 
Bill or Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 was the product 
of what happens when goodwill and the right thing come together 
in Congress. It created a civil renaissance by treating all 
veterans as first class citizens. Empowering veterans proved 
and continues to prove to be the catalyst to revitalizing and 
driving America forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;The original GI Bill was heralded as a success and a major 
contributor to America's stock of human capital that sped long-
term economic growth across the Nation. Eight million World War 
II veterans used the GI Bill and Tom Brokaw called them ``The 
Greatest Generation.'' Many believe, including me, particularly 
as you look at the young men and women testifying this evening, 
all GI Bill graduates, that we are on the precipice of the next 
greatest generation. And that is no slight to veterans in 
between, including myself.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;I am hopeful that this hearing will be somewhat uneventful, 
as VA has outlined support, some with concerns in a caveat that 
they are subject to offsets for almost all of these sections. 
We are happy to work with the Committee to ensure we achieve 
the best possible outcomes for veterans, servicemembers, and 
their families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;We also note that many of these bills would require changes 
to our IT systems, and will require staff and resources in 
order to successfully implement them. We appreciate your 
consideration of many of the effective dates that give us time 
to implement them should they be signed into law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;The Department looks forward to working with the Committee. 
And rather than attempt to synopsize our views on each of the 
29 sections, we would like to return some of my time in my oral 
statement in order to have the opportunity for the Subcommittee 
to ask questions and comment on my testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MR PATRICK D. MURRAY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MR PATRICK D. MURRAY"&gt;    Mr. Murray, you are now recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Murray&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and Members
of the Committee, on behalf of the men and women of the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its 
Auxiliary, thank you for the opportunity to provide our remarks 
on today's pending legislation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;The VFW strongly supports restoring educational benefits 
for those servicemen and women called to Active Duty, National 
Guardsmen and Reservists who were placed on involuntary 
activation orders that did not allow them to accrue benefits 
through time and service like their Active duty counterparts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;While stationed abroad and away from their homes and 
families, these troops are denied the ability to gain 
educational credit for use after demobilization. 12304(b) and 
additionally 12301(h) orders need to be amended to keep the 
activation authority, but re-institute the benefits that were 
removed. Thousands of National Guardsmen and Reservists have 
been affected by this change.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;More and more, DoD is using our Nation's reserve component 
to fight our decade-and-a-half war against terror, and these 
men and women to come home without equal benefits is something 
that must be changed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;The VFW supports giving full educational benefits for 
recipients of the Purple Heart. For the past decade and a half, 
we have been sending Reservists into harm's way at an 
unprecedented level and some of them have been wounded in the 
line of duty. Nearly 1500 of these citizen soldiers have bled 
for this country, but have not accrued enough Active duty time 
to obtain full GI Bill benefits. This is the least we can do as 
a country to help those who put their bodies on the line for 
our freedom.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;I especially support this bill because I have a personal 
relationship to it. Jonathan Goldman served in Iraq in my squad 
and he was my driver the night that our vehicle was hit by an 
IED. John, like the rest of our team, was pretty banged up, but 
he was the only one who ultimately did not have to end up being 
medically retired due to his wounds. John still carries the 
scars with him today and he is not eligible for many of the 
other benefits that myself and my other teammate received.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;Extending mere months of education eligibility for troops 
like John is something the VFW fully supports and I personally 
support vehemently.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;Finally, I would like to focus on the school closure 
section of this bill. The VFW strongly supports this portion of 
the legislation to protect student veterans who are negatively 
affected by school closures. Recently, ITT Tech, Corinthian, 
and West Tech College suddenly shuttered their doors after 
losing accreditation. This left thousands of student veterans 
out of school mid-semester with no plan for what to do the rest 
of the term. They have lost weeks or months of GI Bill benefits 
that were wasted at failed institutions. Even worse, they lost 
the monthly housing stipend many relied upon for their living 
situation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;After the failure of ITT Tech, the VFW reached out to these 
student veterans affected by the closure and offered them 
assistance through our Unmet Needs Grant Program. The VFW 
provided students with emergency grants in order to keep them 
afloat for another month or so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;The impact the school closing had on these student veterans 
was devastating. We received multiple responses to the students 
we reached out to and the reports of their situations was 
disheartening, to say the least. We had reports of veterans 
being mere weeks away from living in their cars, veterans 
choosing between which meals to skip during the day, and no 
help from the VA or their schools to rectify the situation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;Thankfully, we were able to reach out and help these 
students during their struggle, but the VFW and organizations 
like ours cannot be the only entities stepping up to remedy the 
situation. We provided the student veterans with some financial 
stability to make it through the next few weeks while they got 
settled after this major life upheaval; this, however, was only 
a Band Aid for the real problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;These student veterans need protection for issues like this 
so they will not be affected as badly as they are in the 
future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;This legislation allows for the affected student veterans 
to recoup the lost months of GI Bill eligibility in only the 
semester their schools are closed. While we support this 
initiative, we feel it does not go far enough. We think student 
veterans should be able to recoup their months of eligibility 
wasted at the closed institutions, just like traditional 
students can with Pell Grants.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;Student veterans who attended schools like ITT have now 
lost these months eligibility and they have no credits to show 
for it. The VFW has heard from these student veterans from the 
closed schools and they are now struggling to complete their 
degrees at other institutions without their previous earned 
credits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Murray"&gt;GI Bill eligibility should be allowed to be recouped and 
student veterans deserve the same equality as every other 
student affected by school closures. This bill is an important 
first step towards rectifying this entire situation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hubbard&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and Members
of this Committee, thank you for inviting Student Veterans of 
America to submit our testimony on the Harry W. Colmery 
Veterans Educational Assistance Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;This legislation seeks to fix many of the current 
challenges within the Post-9/11 GI Bill, while also addressing 
ongoing inequities to provide veterans and their family's 
access to the benefits they earned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;In May, we convened nearly 40 military, veteran, and higher 
education organizations for a roundtable discussion at the 
headquarters of our friends at the American Legion to discuss 
education policy priorities for veterans, and last week we had 
the second roundtable discussion, hosted by our gracious 
friends at the VFW, to determine how we make those priorities a 
reality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;This proposal is where it is at today thanks to the 
incredible leadership of this Committee, as well as the support 
from the following organizations: The Veterans of Foreign Wars, 
Got Your 6, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, 
Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Legion, and the 
Military Order of the Purple Heart. This broad coalition of 
organizations, and many others, is firmly committed to getting 
the Colmery GI Bill through this Congress and onto the 
President's desk for signature.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;The first inequity addressed in this proposal includes the 
National Guard and Reserve members who served under the 
12304(b) authorization orders. I would like to highlight the 
case of the deployment of the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground 
Task Force in 2016 who experienced this issue firsthand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;In the case of this unit, hundreds of Marine Corps Reserves 
were inaccurately advised by senior leadership that they would 
receive GI Bill benefits for their Active duty service, only to 
later learn that they would get nothing. The fully retroactive 
solution in this proposal addresses this regrettable oversight.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;Next, this legislation would begin to tackle the challenge 
of making whole veterans who experience school closures. The 
closure of ITT Tech demonstrated that the issue of school 
closures is not likely to go away any time soon. Beginning with 
the stunning moral and fiscal bankruptcy of the Corinthian 
Colleges brought to light in 2015, student veterans are known 
to be the only students that currently receive no type of 
restitution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;We also strongly encourage the consideration of the 
following recommendations. Broaden the restitution for veterans 
who experience school closures, ensuring that VA has similar 
authority to restore GI Bill benefits as the Department of 
Education to provide restitution for Federal student loan 
borrowers after school closures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;Full funding for the state approving agencies, the 
watchdogs of the GI Bill, with a total annual increase from $19 
million to the requested funding rate of $26 million, with 
assurances that these additional funds will help prevent future 
school closures by looking out for signs of predatory programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;Restoration of GI Bill benefits for any credits earned at a 
closed school that cannot be transferred to a new program or 
institution, with a specific focus on providing relief to the 
beneficiaries affected by the ITT closures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;We also enthusiastically praise this Committee for the 
recognition of the importance and the value of science, 
technology, engineering, and math, STEM, degrees. These degrees 
provide a high value for the veteran and the country, but often 
require additional time to complete. We would like to work 
closely with the SAAs to ensure students entering these fields 
are protected and that they reflect the national need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;I want to also acknowledge Congressman David McKinley and 
Congresswoman Dina Titus for recognizing this challenge early 
and remaining steadfast in pursuing the STEM Extension Act now 
included in this package as the Edith Rogers Scholarship.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;When I first saw the text of this bill I thought, if 
student veterans sat down to write a bill, it would look like 
this. This package reflects so many essential solution-oriented 
provisions that increase access to education, address the 
inequities of this earned benefit, and look forward to the 
future well beyond our own generation. The passage of this bill 
will represent the start of a new era for education for 
veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;Additionally, the staff of the Chairman and the Ranking 
Member demonstrate their dedication to the cause of veterans in 
such a manner that it is humbling to consider them as 
colleagues and friends.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;I would like to acknowledge Jon Clark, Kelsey Baron, Ray 
Kelly, Cathy Yu, Caroline Ponseti, and Tiffany Haverly. To each 
of you, you have demonstrated the heartfelt appreciation of 
millions of veterans and their families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;To Leader McCarthy and Leader Pelosi, as well as their 
staff, Tiffany Wolfolk and Patty Ross, you also have proven a 
spirit of bipartisanship and commitment to veterans that will 
be remembered for many years to come.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, America is fortunate to 
have you at the helm of this esteemed body, two Members of 
Congress that have demonstrated a model of bipartisanship and 
collaboration to the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MR. JOHN KAMIN&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MR. JOHN KAMIN"&gt;    Mr. Kamin, you are recognized now for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kamin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and
distinguished Members of this Committee, on behalf of National 
Commander Charles E. Schmidt and the two million members of the 
American Legion, we thank you for your leadership on behalf of 
servicemembers and veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;The last few months were not easy as solutions were 
proposed to improve the GI Bill. With public disagreements 
dividing us, many believed that it would be impossible to get 
anything done this year for veterans' education, yet this 
Committee made it happen in under three months. This reflects 
remarkable determination and statesmanship from Chairman Roe 
and Ranking Member Walz, as well as the broad bipartisanship 
that rose to the occasion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;As the largest organization of wartime veterans, we 
appreciate the opportunity to present the American Legion's 
views on the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance 
Act. As all of us worked together over the past few months on 
the future of the GI Bill, we can think of no greater namesake 
than our past National Commander Harry Colmery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;In 1943, the Committee on World War Veterans was deeply 
focused on the inevitable issues servicemembers would face 
whenever the war ended. Many believed that education had no 
place as a veteran's benefit and others believed the benefit 
should be limited exclusively to wounded veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;Harry Colmery had a different vision. As a World War I 
veteran, he knew firsthand the challenges of transitioning from 
war. He saw the potential for a benefit that didn't create 
dependence, but would foster greater citizenship through 
economic empowerment; a benefit rooted in the idea that the 
individual, not the Government, could decide how and where to 
use it; a benefit that would challenge the status quo that 
education was the providence of the wealthy and the elite.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;Working from Washington's Mayflower Hotel over five months, 
Colmery handwrote page after page of his vision on the back of 
hotel stationery. These notes would become the Servicemen's 
Readjustment Act of 1944.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;As we now turn our attention to improving our generation's 
GI Bill, we proudly proclaim that this bill reaffirms the 
ideals of Harry Colmery and the American Legion, that investing 
in veterans' education makes this country greater. This bill 
does this through 28 distinct sections, most strikingly is 
making the GI Bill a forever benefit. This has the potential to 
greatly increase GI Bill usage rates by providing 
servicemembers the flexibility they need to pursue their 
educational aspirations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;No matter how widely it is known, not all veterans will 
utilize the GI Bill with a 15-year cap simply because it 
doesn't make sense for some of them to use it. If a Marine 
Sergeant with a Bachelor's degree transitions to civilian life 
as a Government contractor, it may not make sense for her to 
immediately use the GI Bill. However, if 15 years later she 
seeks a different career path, the GI Bill is as valuable to 
her future as it was as if she had just transitioned from 
Active duty. This bill makes it possible for veterans to 
utilize this benefit at the right time and the right place and, 
more importantly, it takes the benefit out of the Government's 
hand and gives it to the veteran.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;This bill also begins to address a burgeoning issue: 
unequal education benefits for Reserve and National Guard 
servicemembers with the advent of 12304(b) orders. While there 
have been roughly 6,000 activations thus far, make no mistake 
as to how the Department of Defense intends to utilize this 
order. To wit, the Department of the Army's OCO budget 
requested 18,738 man years for 12304(b) orders for fiscal year 
2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;We could have not asked for a better champion on this than 
a National Guard Sergeant Major and we applaud the Ranking 
Member for his tenacity on behalf of all Guard and Reservists. 
This bill not only accomplishes this, but also awards 
retroactive benefits to all servicemembers issued these orders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;As the Committee affirms its commitment to veterans' 
education, it is for us to rededicate our efforts to refining 
the GI Bill for the next generation. We see numerous areas that 
can still be improved: increasing the state approving agency's 
funding from 19 million to a rate of 26 million, so SAAs can 
effectively perform their oversight responsibilities; 
empowering our servicemembers and veterans to be informed 
consumers who can make the choices they can on how to use their 
benefit; and developing a solution that would provide GI Bill 
resources and start-up capital to small businesses, just as the 
original GI Bill did.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;These improvements may seem small, but the impact cannot be 
overstated. Just as the original GI Bill was beyond any 
measurement at the time, the bills that this Committee passes 
will have an impact beyond our years, not just on our veterans, 
but on the country as a whole.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;As I conclude, I would like to quote the closing remarks of 
Harry Colmery's testimony to Congress in 1944. ``These men will 
be a potent force for good or evil in the years to come: they 
can make our country or they can break it, they can restore our 
democracy or scrap it, they can promote world order or World 
War III. The answer lies in leadership. We look to the American 
Congress to step forward and give some of that leadership. This 
is your opportunity and you can count on the American Legion to 
add its experience and influence to assist in guiding and 
directing the Nation along the path of peaceful progress.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Kamin"&gt;Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, distinguished Members of 
this Committee, to evoke Harry Colmery, you can still count on 
us today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MS. ASHLYNNE HAYCOCK&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MS. ASHLYNNE HAYCOCK"&gt;    Ms. Haycock, you are recognized now for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Haycock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and
distinguished Committee Members, thank you for the opportunity 
to speak on behalf of surviving families of our Nation's fallen 
heroes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;I am the surviving daughter of Army SFC Jeffrey Haycock, 
who died in the line of duty in 2002, and Air Force Veteran 
Nichole Haycock, who died by suicide in 2011.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;In 2010, I was one of the very first recipients of the 
Marine Gunnery Sergeant John Fry Scholarship, and for that 
opportunity I am incredibly grateful to this Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;I would also like to thank the Committee for several 
expansions of survivor benefits included in the Jeff Miller and 
Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits 
Improvement Act of 2016, such as guaranteed in-state tuition 
for Fry recipients and additional time to utilize the Fry 
Scholarship for our earliest post-9/11 widows.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;TAPS' main legislative priority over the last several years 
has been the expansion of the Yellow Ribbon Program to Fry 
Scholarship recipients. Currently, only those receiving the 
Post-9/11 GI Bill and those with transferred entitlement are 
eligible. If the veteran is still alive and transferred their 
benefits to their dependents, they would be eligible for this 
expanded benefit, while children and spouses of America's 
heroes who died in the line of duty are not. We would like to 
see this inequity corrected.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;This impacts children like Emily McClimans, whose father 
was an Army Officer killed in action in 2011 when Emily was 
just 13 years old. Emily is a sophomore at Texas Christian 
University. The tuition is over $40,000 per year, but her Fry 
Scholarship only covers 22,000 of it. That is more than $18,000 
that Emily has to come up with every single year. TCU offers 
750 Yellow Ribbon Program scholarships and they only filled 300 
of them this year. These are slots that could go to children 
like Emily to pursue her dreams and allow her to graduate from 
college debt-free, a dream her father had for her.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;TAPS strongly supports Section 108 of H.R. 3218.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;TAPS is also advocating for an increase in Chapter 35 
education benefits. The current rate is $1,024 per month and is 
far inferior to the rates of Post-9/11 and Montgomery GI Bills. 
The rates have not been increased with the exception of for 
cost of living since 2003.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;Many of TAPS survivors are not eligible for the Fry 
Scholarship because the servicemember died before 9/11 or died 
in veteran or retiree status. This includes children like Shana 
Pellegrin whose mother, Navy Lieutenant Karen Pellegrin, died 
in the line of duty just a few months before 9/11, making her 
ineligible for the Fry Scholarship.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;Shana is a rising sophomore at Virginia Tech; she is also 
here with us this evening. Her father has had to pay a large 
portion of Shana's college out of pocket, because the $9,000 a 
year under Chapter 35 is not enough to cover the cost of 
attendance. While the extra money per month included in 
proposed legislation would not cover everything, it would make 
a huge difference to families like Shana's who are not 
fortunate enough to be eligible for robust benefits like Fry, 
even though their service and sacrifice were the same.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;TAPS strongly supports Sections 202 and 203 of H.R. 3218.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;We are also grateful for the inclusion of a technical 
change for transferred entitlement in Section 109. Currently, a 
servicemember or veteran who has transferred their GI Bill can 
adjust the number of months of eligibility between the 
different family members, but when they die those months are 
locked in and the family cannot adjust them as needed. This 
impacts survivors like Coleen Bowman, whose Army husband died 
from burn pit exposure in 2013.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;Sergeant Major Bowman was medically retired because of 
terminal cancer, so his children are not Fry eligible, but 
Sergeant Major Bowman split his GI Bill between his wife and 
four daughters. Coleen has no intention of ever using her 
allocated months and would like to give it to her children, but 
because of current regulations she cannot do this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;This would not allow families to add new transferees, only 
adjust the number of months amongst themselves, something the 
servicemember would have been able to do if they were still 
alive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;TAPS strongly supports Section 109 of H.R. 3218.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;TAPS is proud to have worked closely with partner 
organizations such as Student Veterans of America, the American 
Legion, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars to raise awareness of 
the many issues in the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational 
Assistance Act of 2017. TAPS supports the bill in its entirety, 
but specifically the points that impact survivors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;We would also like to reiterate our support for the removal 
of the arbitrary 15-year eliminating date. We understand that 
these programs are expensive and we appreciate that there is a 
recommendation to fund these changes, as well as the upgrades 
to the GI Bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Haycock"&gt;Our families have already paid the price for these benefits 
through the loss of their loved ones. The proposed legislation 
protects and expands survivor benefits, creates new and 
innovative programs for veterans, and helps sustain the GI Bill 
for a new generation of servicemembers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding"&gt;Mrs. Radewagen, you are recognized for five minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding"&gt;Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no further 
questions. I just want to thank you all for your great service 
and God bless America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Ms&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="The Chairman. Ms"&gt; Esty, you are recognized for five
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Esty&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;No questions, but just saying this is really a model of 
democracy, which is not just about Congress working, but about 
the American people, those of you in this room who served and 
those who served by helping us get it right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;The military is changing, the country is changing, and it 
was high time for the GI Bill to change in accordance with it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;So congratulations to the Chairman and Ranking Member, 
everyone on this Committee, but most importantly the people in 
this room who helped us get it if not completely right, at 
least better for those who are serving now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;    Thanks very much.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding"&gt;    Mr. Poliquin, you are recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Poliquin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;God bless the United States of America, God
bless our veterans. The more knowledge, the more education the 
better. We owe it to our veterans. God bless you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;    Thank you. No questions, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;    Mr. Correa, you are recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Correa&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Correa"&gt;No questions, but comments. Again, Mr. Chair
and Ranking Member, Members of this Committee, and our 
veterans, thank you very much. It looks like a great piece of 
legislation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Correa"&gt;I am going to put it to the acid test in the next few 
weeks. I am going to go back to my district and do a road show 
with my veterans and see what they have to say. I think they 
will be happy, but they have the final say.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Correa"&gt;    Thank you very much, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you, Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr"&gt;Correa. Thank you, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr"&gt;    Let's see--oh, okay. Yes, Dr. Dunn. Sorry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Dunn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Dunn"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me add my thanks
both to you and to Mr. Walz. It is a pleasure and an honor to 
serve with you on this Committee, and also to serve the men and 
women who served us so well in uniform.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Dunn"&gt;I will say that it is sort of sad to contemplate in 
response to your remark about the newspaper, you may not see 
this in the newspaper tomorrow. We may not, but I think it is 
actually some of the most important things that we have done in 
a long time up here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Dunn"&gt;And thank you all very much and thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Dunn"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;    General Bergman, you are recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bergman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Bergman"&gt;Well, as the Chairman of the Oversight and
Investigation Committee, I hope I don't have a follow-up 
hearing on this, and I am sure the Ranking Member Kuster feels 
the same.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Bergman"&gt;Thanks to everyone for all you have done, but I do have a 
quick question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Bergman"&gt;    Mr. Coy, when you implement the policies in this bill, what 
do you anticipate the biggest challenges are going to be for 
the VA. Knowing this is a change, this is a new bill, what are 
you thinking you are going to run into?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Coy&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;I think across the board when you talk to the
people that work at the VA, this bill is an exciting bill for 
lots of reasons and many of them have been expressed this 
evening.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Coy"&gt;    Probably my biggest concern is two words: IT. We have an IT 
system and much or almost all of these sections require some 
degree of changes in our IT system, and that is what concerns 
me the most, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bergman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Bergman"&gt;Okay. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Bergman"&gt;    Mr. Hubbard, in your written testimony you discussed the IT 
needs of the GI Bill and they are overlooked. Could you please 
address that thought and how it is, you know, best addressed in 
this bill?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hubbard&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;Yes. Thank you for the question, Congressman,
I appreciate that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Hubbard"&gt;    We too support the VA on a daily basis, we work closely 
with their staff and are intimately familiar with many of the 
needs required to implement many of these provisions. As such, 
we had that expressed in there and certainly fully support the 
VA. We would love to work with this body to ensure that the 
intent of this legislation is carried out and executed properly 
and to the full extent of the available provisions provided, 
and we look forward to that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bergman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Bergman"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Bergman"&gt;And, you know, I know it is early in the process here and, 
you know, we are before even a rollout, but I just implore the 
VA and all the VSOs and all those involved with the rollout of 
this that sense of urgency when it comes to actually catching 
something early on when it is not going right, that sense of 
urgency brings it to the forefront so we can address the issue 
on behalf of the veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Bergman"&gt;    And with that, sir, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;    Mr. Banks, you are recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Banks&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Banks"&gt; No questions, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;Miss Gonzalez-Colon, you are recognized for five minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;I will have no questions, but I would like to command and 
recognize your leadership and Mr. Walz. It is an honor to serve 
on this Committee under your leadership.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;I think it is a great opportunity to see things happening 
in just seven months I have been here, so many great 
legislation, and being here today, amending and having a new 
bill, a GI Bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;I can't vote on the floor, as you may know, as a 
representative from the Island, but this bill, I will be on 
Wednesday in this markup when I do and can vote, and 
representative for the million American citizens that do go to 
war and represent the United States in every branch of our 
military that do serve proudly. I feel very honored to be an 
original cosponsor of this bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;    Thank you and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding"&gt;    Mr. Rutherford, you are recognized for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rutherford&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;I yield back, Mr. Chairman, my time, other
than I don't want to miss the opportunity to thank all of our 
VSOs, everyone in this room. Thank you so much, panel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"&gt;    And thank you, Mr. Chairman and the Ranking Member and 
Committee. God bless.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;And on behalf of this Committee, I want to thank each and 
every one of you for your testimony and your incredible hard 
work, along with the staff, over the past several months. You 
know, we have had a hiccup or two getting where we are tonight 
sitting here and Wednesday we are going to mark this up, and 
hopefully get unanimous consent and on board.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;And I can't tell you how much I appreciate personally your 
effort of all the organizations in this room and sat down 
around the table with staff and worked out the issues. And it 
is the way it should work and I can't not thank you enough for 
that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding"&gt;    I will now yield to Mr. Walz for any closing statements.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt; I concur.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;    The Chairman. I think there are three or four things that &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;I concur.
are for me absolute terrific. My GI Bill benefit ran out in ten 
years, this is a lifetime benefit. People having to retain in 
their lives now for these incredible tech jobs and so forth 
that are out there to be had right now, high-paying jobs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;I think the Guard and Reserve, that is bothered me since I 
have been here that we didn't call a Guard and Reservist a 
veteran and it just bothered me, tremendously bothered me. And 
I think now doing the right thing for the Guard and Reserve is 
to me very important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;And I think the Purple Heart recipients, I mean, that goes 
without saying. I think Americans wouldn't understand why that 
wouldn't happen and I think once they understand that it is 
happening, I think they will be very pleased that this 
Committee and that the VSOs and others have worked towards this 
means.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;And another one for me are the Gold Star families that lose 
a loved one in service to our great Nation and then find out 
that we are not treating them the same as others. That was 
wrong and we have corrected those wrongs in this bill. And I 
again, once again, I can't thank you enough for the work you 
have done to make this successful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;And before we close, I ask unanimous consent that the 
statements be submitted into the hearing record for the 
following organizations and individuals: Representative David 
McKinley of West Virginia, Representative Markwayne Mullin of 
Oklahoma, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, Representative Susan 
Brooks of Indiana, Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, the 
Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Guard 
Association of the United States, the Veterans Education 
Success, Captain Edward H. Hill, Vietnam Veterans of America, 
High Ground Veterans Advocacy, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of 
America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Hearing no objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;I now ask unanimous consent that all Members have five 
legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Hearing no objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;I would like to remind the Members we will hold a Full 
Committee hearing markup on this legislation, as well as other 
bills pending before the Committee, 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday of 
this week.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;I thank all Members in attendance tonight. The meeting is 
adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;[Whereupon, at 8:46 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Prepared Statement of Curtis L. Coy&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Good evening, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. I am 
pleased to be here today to provide the views of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) on H.R. 3218, the ``Harry W. Colmery Veterans 
Educational Assistance Act of 2017.'' Unfortunately, due to the late 
notice of the hearing and the receipt of the draft bill on July 10, 
2017, we are unable to provide complete cost estimates for many 
sections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Accompanying me today is James Ruhlman, Assistant Director for 
Policy and Procedures of the VA Education Service.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;TITLE I - POST-9/11 EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
SECTION 101&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 101 would amend 38 United States Code (U.S.C.) Sec.  
3301(1)(B) to count the time that a reservist is ordered to active duty 
to receive authorized medical care, be medically evaluated for 
disability, or complete a Department of Defense (DoD) health care 
study, as active duty for purposes of the Post 9/11 Veterans 
Educational Assistance Act of 2008. The amendment would be retroactive 
to immediately after enactment of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational 
Assistance Act of 2008, and a reservist could use such entitlement to 
pursue a course of education on or after August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports the intent of section 101, regarding the proposed 
changes to qualifying active duty service under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, 
subject to the availability of funds. We note, however, that this 
change to the eligibility criteria would require VA to make 
modifications to the type of data exchanged between DoD and VA through 
the VA/DoD Identity Repository and displayed in the Veteran Information 
System. In addition, new rules would need to be programmed into the 
Long term Solution system (LTS) in order to calculate eligibility based 
on service described in new section 3301(1)(B) and to allow for 
retroactive benefit payments, while limiting awards of educational 
assistance based on such service to programs pursued on or after August 
1, 2018. VA estimates that it would need one year from enactment to 
complete these changes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional full time equivalent employee (FTE) or 
general operating expense (GOE) costs associated with the proposed 
legislation.
SECTION 102&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 102 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3311(b) by consolidating 
the current amount of qualifying active duty service required after 
September 10, 2001, for payment of educational assistance at the 50-
percent and 60-percent benefit levels under the Post-9/11 Educational 
Assistance Program. As a result, the current benefit level requiring at 
least six months but less than twelve months of active-duty service 
would be eliminated. This means that an individual with aggregate 
service of at least six months but less than eighteen months of active-
duty service (excluding entry and skill training) would qualify at the 
60 percent benefit level. Section 102 would be effective on August 1, 
2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 102, subject to the availability of funds. VA 
estimates that it would require one year from the date of enactment to 
make modifications to the LTS necessary to implement section 102. We 
have not, however, fully determined if there would be any costs 
associated with information technology (IT) changes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Finally, additional conforming amendments to title 38 U.S.C. would 
be required based upon the changes made by amending section 3311(b) and 
3313(c).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no FTE and GOE costs requirements associated with this 
section.
SECTION 103&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 103 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3311(b) to expand Post-9/11 
GI Bill educational assistance to individuals awarded the Purple Heart 
for service in the Armed Forces occurring on or after September 11, 
2001, at the same rate (100%) as for individuals entitled to Post-9/11 
GI Bill educational assistance who served at least 3 years on active 
duty or who served at least 30 days on active duty and were discharged 
for a service-connected disability. Section 103 would also allow such 
Purple Heart recipients to participate in the Yellow Ribbon G.I. 
Education Enhancement Program. Section 103 would be effective August 1, 
2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 103, subject to the availability of funds. 
Because VA would need to modify its existing IT system to implement 
section 103, there would be associated IT costs. Specifically, VA would 
need to modify the LTS, VA's Post-9/11 GI Bill processing system, to 
verify eligibility for Purple Heart recipients. VA would also need to 
make changes to the VA application forms (VA Form 22-1990 and Veterans 
On-Line Application) to identify Purple Heart recipients. VA suggests a 
review of other medals, i.e., Medal of Honor, Silver Star, and Service 
Cross, recipients of which could also merit eligibility at the 100% 
benefit level as well.
SECTION 104&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 104 would provide that a reservist who established 
eligibility to educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. Sec.  16163(a)(1) 
before November 25, 2015, and loses eligibility for such assistance 
under 10 U.S.C. Sec.  16167(b) would be able to elect to have such 
service credited towards establishing eligibility under 38 U.S.C. Sec.  
3313 equal to the number of months of entitlement remaining under 
chapter 1607 of title 10 U.S.C.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports the intent of section 104 because it would provide 
educational assistance benefits for individuals who abruptly lost 
eligibility to the Reserve Educational Assistance Program on November 
25, 2015. However, VA has the following concerns regarding section 104. 
First, section 104(c) refers to 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3311(b)(6) as amended 
by section 104(a); however, section 104(a) does not contain an 
amendment to section 3311(b)(6). We believe that section 104(c) should 
refer to section 102(a) of the bill, and we recommend that section 
104(c) be amended accordingly. Second, we interpret section 104(c) to 
mean that all individuals establishing eligibility under this provision 
would be eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits at the 60-percent 
benefit level, regardless of the amount of aggregate service. However, 
section 104 is silent as to how additional active-duty service not 
credited toward chapter 1607 would impact the benefit level of an 
individual who establishes eligibility to the Post-9/11 GI Bill under 
section 104. We would be happy to provide further technical assistance 
as necessary to accomplish the desired intent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE cost requirements associated 
with this section.
SECTION 105&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 105 would amend Sec.  3313(c)(1)(B)(i)(I) of title 38 to 
provide for the calculation of the monthly housing allowance (MHA) 
payable under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on the location of the campus 
where the individual physically participates in a majority of classes, 
rather than the location of the institution of higher learning (IHL) at 
which the individual is enrolled. Section 105 would apply to the 
initial enrollment in a program of education on or after August 1, 
2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 105 because it would make MHA payments 
commensurate with the cost of housing in the location where students 
actually attend classes. In particular, section 105 would address two 
situations in which the current MHA is likely not aligned with the cost 
of living where an individual actually attends classes: (1) courses 
that are held at a branch or satellite location of an IHL rather than 
at the IHL's main campus; and (2) online degree programs that require 
some in-residence courses. We believe that section 105 would also 
remove the issue of the amount of the MHA as a factor in choosing a 
school and instead allow students to focus on the educational program 
when choosing an IHL. VA would need to modify LTS in order to calculate 
MHA based on whether the initial enrollment in a program of education 
occurred on or after August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA is unable to determine if any costs or savings would result from 
section 105 because of a lack of data on trainees who attend school at 
a branch location with a zip code that is different than the main 
campus. Therefore, the total increase or decrease in MHA payments 
cannot be determined. This legislation would ensure that MHA payments 
are relative to the trainees' actual training location and cost of 
living, not the main campus' location. Additionally, this bill would 
prevent trainees from seeking an IHL that would yield a higher MHA 
payment at a main campus when compared to a branch campus. If trainees 
no longer seek IHLs based on higher MHA payments, this may result in a 
savings. However without data, VA cannot determine if this bill would 
result in any costs or savings. There are no additional FTE or GOE cost 
requirements associated with this section.
SECTION 106&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 106 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  3315(c) and 3315A to 
allow for the proration of entitlement charges for licensing and 
certification examinations and national tests under the Post-9/11 GI 
Bill based on the actual amount of the fee charged for the test. 
Section 106 would also add educational assistance for chapter-33 
beneficiaries for a ``national test that evaluates prior learning and 
knowledge and provides an opportunity for course credit at an 
institution of higher learning as so described.'' The amendments made 
by this section would apply to a test taken on or after August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 106 because it would benefit Post-9/11 GI Bill 
beneficiaries by reducing the negative impact of test reimbursement on 
their remaining benefit entitlement and increasing the months of 
training available for the beneficiaries, thus expanding educational 
opportunities. Under current sections 3315 and 3315A, an individual is 
charged entitlement for the reimbursement of fees associated with a 
licensing or certification exam, or a national test, in whole months. 
Thus, VA charges an individual 1 month of entitlement for each 
$1,832.96 reimbursed for the academic year beginning on August 1, 2016, 
rounded to the nearest whole month, regardless of the cost of the test. 
However, VA suggests that the parenthetical ``(rounded to the nearest 
whole month)'' be struck from sections 3315(c) and 3315A(c) as the 
phrase would now be superfluous.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;As noted in VA's Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 legislative proposal, the 
Department believes the law should be amended to charge entitlement for 
reimbursement of VA approved exams at a prorated number of days of 
entitlement based on the ratio of the cost of the test to the statutory 
amount.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this 
section.
SECTION 107&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 107 would add a new section 3699 to title 38 U.S.C. which 
would provide that, if VA finds that an individual was forced to 
discontinue pursuit of a course or courses under the Post-9/11 GI Bill 
as a result of closure of an institution or disapproval of a course of 
study and did not receive credit or lost training time toward 
completion of the program being pursued at the time of closure, any 
payment of educational assistance to the individual for pursuit of the 
course or courses would not be charged against the individual's 
entitlement to benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill or counted against 
the aggregate period for which 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3695 limits the 
individual's receipt of educational assistance. The period for which 
educational assistance would not be charged against entitlement or 
counted toward the aggregate period under section 3695 would not exceed 
the aggregate of the portion of the period of enrollment from which the 
individual failed to receive credit or lost training time, and the 
period by which a monthly stipend is extended under section 
3680(a)(2)(B) of title 38. VA may treat a course of education that is 
disapproved under this chapter as being approved, if VA determines, on 
a case-by-case basis, that the course was disapproved for one of the 
reasons stated above and continuing the course is in the best interest 
of the individual.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 107 would also amend section 3680(a) of title 38 U.S.C. to 
authorize VA to prescribe regulations to continue awarding a monthly 
housing allowance stipend under the Post-9/11 GI Bill following a 
permanent school closure or the disapproval of a course of study as 
described in section 3699(b)(1)(B). The housing allowance would be 
payable until the earlier of the date of the end of the term, quarter, 
or semester during which the school closure or disapproval occurred; or 
120 days after the date of the school closure or disapproval. The 
proposed legislation would take effect 90 days after enactment and 
apply to courses and programs of education discontinued after January 
1, 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 107. The closure of educational institutions 
while GI Bill beneficiaries are actively pursuing an approved program 
of education or training negatively impacts student Veterans and 
eligible dependents. While VA can pay benefits for the term, quarter, 
or semester up to the time of the school's closure, the student is 
charged entitlement for the period prior to the closure for which 
benefits are received, even if the student does not earn any credit 
toward completion of a program. In some instances, this could result in 
a beneficiary exhausting chapter-33 entitlement prior to being able to 
complete his/her program at another institution. Allowing VA to restore 
entitlement and to continue to pay MHAs in the event of a school 
closure would be in the best interests of Veterans and would help 
ensure that they are able to successfully complete their educational 
goals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA sees no need for the provision that would allow for the 
restoration of entitlement in cases involving course disapproval. 
Current VA policies provide that whenever a program loses its approval, 
any student currently enrolled in the program is allowed to complete 
the current term because, unlike in the case of a school closure, the 
students may still pursue the program. Therefore, there are not any 
students who do not receive credit, or lose training time, toward 
completion of the program as a direct result of the disapproval. 
Consequently, inclusion of disapproved courses in section 107 is 
superfluous.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this 
section.
SECTION 108&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 108 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3317(a) to provide that 
recipients of the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship 
would be covered under the Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement 
Program. The Yellow Ribbon program is currently available to Veterans 
and most transfer of entitlement recipients receiving Post-9/11 GI Bill 
benefits at the 100% benefit level attending institutions of higher 
learning. The program provides payment for up to half of the tuition 
and fee charges that are not covered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill, such as 
charges that exceed an academic year cap or out-of-state charges, if 
the institution enters into an agreement with VA to pay or waive an 
equal amount of the charges that exceed Post-9/11 GI Bill coverage. 
This section would be effective on August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports the intent of section 108, subject to the availability 
of funds. Also, VA estimates that implementation of section 108 would 
require one year from the date of enactment to make needed 
modifications to the Benefits Delivery Network (BDN), the VA-Online 
Certification of Enrollment (VA-ONCE), and LTS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this 
section.
SECTION 109&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 109 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3319 to authorize transfer 
of unused Post-9/11 GI Education Assistance benefits to a different 
eligible dependent upon the death of the originally designated 
dependent if the dependent dies before using such entitlement. Also, if 
an individual transferring entitlement under section 3319 dies before 
the dependent to whom entitlement is transferred has used all of such 
entitlement, the dependent would be able to transfer such entitlement 
to another eligible dependent. Section 109 would apply to deaths on or 
after August 1, 2009, and the entitlement could be used on or after 
August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA defers to DoD regarding the amendment providing for designation 
of a dependent upon the death of the originally designated dependent. 
Currently, an individual cannot designate a new dependent to receive a 
transfer of entitlement to Post-9/11 Education Assistance after 
separating from the Armed Forces. However, we interpret section 109 to 
provide that if a Servicemember or Veteran does not transfer the 
maximum entitlement to a dependent, the amount that was not transferred 
would be forfeited.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports allowing an eligible dependent to transfer entitlement 
to another eligible dependent if the individual who transferred 
entitlement dies before the designated dependent uses all of his or her 
entitlement. Currently, if an individual who has transferred 
entitlement subsequently dies, no additional changes to the transferred 
entitlement are authorized.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this 
section.
SECTION 110&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 110 would add a new section, 3320 to title 38 U.S.C. to 
create the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship. The scholarship would 
provide up to 9 months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to an 
individual who: (1) has used all of his or her Post-9/11 GI Bill 
educational assistance or who will, based on the individual's rate of 
usage, use all such assistance within 180 days of application for 
benefits; and (2) is enrolled in a program of education leading to a 
post-secondary degree that requires more than the standard 128 semester 
(or 192 quarter) credit hours for completion in biological or 
biomedical science; physical science; science technologies or 
technicians; computer and information science and support services; 
mathematics or statistics; engineering; engineering technologies or an 
engineering-related field; a health profession or related program; or a 
medical residency program, and has completed at least 60 standard 
semester (or 90 quarter) credit hours in a field listed above, or has 
earned a post-secondary degree in one of these fields and is enrolled 
in a program of education leading to a teaching certification. Priority 
would be given to individuals who require the most credit hours and to 
individuals who are entitled to 100 percent of Post-9/11 GI Bill 
benefits. Each eligible individual would be entitled to a one time 
lump-sum payment that is the lesser of the amount available under 38 
U.S.C. Sec.  3313 or $30,000. These additional benefits would not be 
transferrable to a dependent. Individuals who receive this scholarship 
would also be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement 
Program. However, VA would not be authorized to issue any Yellow Ribbon 
payments for these individuals. Additionally, the total amount of 
benefits paid to all eligible individuals may not exceed $100,000,000 
during any fiscal year. Section 110 would be effective on August 1, 
2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports the intent of section 110 subject to the availability 
of funds. However, VA has concerns about the eligibility criteria for 
the additional educational assistance. As currently drafted, 
individuals who have completed at least 60 standard semester (or 90 
quarter) credit hours in a science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) program of education at the point at which they 
exhaust the 36 months of the chapter-33 entitlement would be eligible 
for an additional 9 months of educational assistance. We do not believe 
that providing additional benefits under these circumstances would 
serve the purpose of section 110, which is designed for programs that 
require more than the standard 128 semester (or 192 quarter) credit 
hours for completion. The additional 9 months of educational assistance 
would not enable individuals who previously completed 60 standard 
semester hours of STEM classes to complete a STEM program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;In addition, it would be difficult for VA to gauge whether an 
individual would use all of his or her entitlement within 180 days from 
date of application for the scholarship. Several factors influence 
entitlement usage such as the length of the enrollment period and an 
individual's decision to reduce the number of classes in which the 
individual is enrolled or to withdraw from school for a period of time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;To implement section 110, VA would need to make modifications to 
VA-ONCE and LTS in order to verify eligibility and allow for the award 
of additional months of educational assistance. VA estimates that it 
would require 1 year from the date of enactment to make the IT changes 
necessary to implement section 110.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this 
section.
SECTION 111&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 111 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3321(a) and (b) by 
eliminating the time limitation for use of Post-9/11 GI benefits by 
individuals, including children of deceased Servicemembers, who first 
become entitled to benefits on or after January 1, 2018. Individuals 
who first become entitled to Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance 
prior to January 1, 2018, would remain subject to the current 15-year 
time limitation for using their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 111, subject to the availability of 
funds,because it would ensure that certain beneficiaries have an 
expanded opportunity to use all their Post-9/11 GI Bill educational 
assistance. However, section 111 would require VA to administer a 
lifelong program for millions of Veterans and dependents. As a result, 
additional staffing and IT resources would be needed because VA would 
have to make modifications to the LTS. Also, section 111 could impact 
VA's ability to predict future workload trends and resource 
requirements.
SECTION 112&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 112 would add a new subsection (j) to 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3313 
to provide for payment of MHA on a pro rata basis for any period in 
which a reservist pursuing a program of education is not performing 
active duty. More specifically, VA would award housing allowance 
benefits for each day of the month an individual is not serving on 
active duty. Currently, monthly housing allowance benefits for an 
otherwise eligible individual are terminated at the end of the month 
that the individual enters onto active duty service. When discharged, 
VA commences payment of the monthly housing allowance for an otherwise 
eligible individual at the beginning of the following month. This 
amendment would be applicable to a quarter, semester or term commencing 
on or after August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 112 as it would be equitable to prorate MHA 
payments for any period in which a reservist or individual is not 
performing active duty. We note, however, that section 112 would result 
in a decrease in the amount of MHA for the month in which a reservist 
is ordered to active duty and in an increase in the MHA for the month 
in which a reservist is released from active duty. Consequently, the 
amount of MHA that each reservist receives would depend upon the dates 
on which the reservist entered and was released from active duty. We 
note as well that new section 3313(j) would not apply to other persons 
on ``active duty'' as defined in 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3301(1)(A) and (C).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;We note that due to the proposed definition of ``an individual'' as 
specified in the bill, and current VA regulations, members of the 
regular components of the Armed Forces and members of the Army National 
Guard or Air National Guard serving on active duty would not be 
impacted by the amendment (i.e., changes to housing allowance benefits 
due to changes in duty status would continue to be effective at the 
beginning of the month following the change in duty status based on VA 
regulations).VA would have to modify the LTS to calculate the prorated 
MHA and manual award calculations and payment authorizations would be 
required until the LTS is modified.
SECTION 113&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 113(a) would require VA to make changes and improvements to 
the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) IT systems to ensure that, 
to the maximum extent practicable, all original and supplemental claims 
for educational assistance under chapter 33 are adjudicated 
electronically and that rules-based processing is used to make 
decisions on such claims with little human intervention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The proposed section would require VA to submit a plan to implement 
the changes and improvements to VBA's IT systems to Congress no later 
than 180 days after enactment. VA would also be required to submit a 
report to Congress on the implementation of the changes and 
improvements one year after enactment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Finally, this section would authorize an appropriation of 
$30,000,000 to VA to carry out the requirements of this section during 
fiscal years 2018 and FY 2019. VA concurs that there is room to improve 
the automation of the processing of education benefits claims. VBA is 
currently working with the Office of Information and Technology to 
assess IT capabilities. While VA is currently prioritizing replacement 
of legacy systems due to the risk of maintaining these systems, VA is 
also considering additional LTS functionality needed to provide faster 
and more accurate claims processing for those who apply for Post-9/11 
GI Bill benefits and submit supplemental claims. The current average 
processing time for eligibility claims, which are not automated and are 
very labor-intensive, is 26 days. During calendar year 2017, an average 
of over 5,200 supplemental (reenrollment) claims were processed 
automatically each day using LTS, without human intervention. The 
remainder of the supplemental claims are processed using partial 
automation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA would be able to provide a plan of implementation for the 
required IT changes within 180 days after enactment; however, VA would 
require at least 24 months from the date of enactment in order to 
report on those changes due to the time needed for the procurement 
process, systems development, testing, and deployment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;No benefit costs are associated with section 113. There are no 
additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this section.
SECTION 114&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 114 would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to 
carry out a pilot program for 5 years under which eligible Veterans who 
are entitled to educational assistance would be able to enroll in high 
technology programs of education. The term ``high technology program of 
education'' would be defined as a program of education that is offered 
by an entity other than an IHL, does not lead to a degree, and provides 
instruction in computer programming, computer software, media 
application, data processing, or information sciences. Within 180 days 
after August 1, 2018, VA would be required to seek to enter into 
contracts with multiple qualified providers of such programs. Under 
these contracts, VA would agree to pay the provider 25 percent of the 
cost of providing the program of education upon enrollment of an 
eligible Veteran; 25 percent of the cost upon completion of the program 
by the Veteran; and 50 percent of the cost upon the employment of the 
Veteran in the field of study of the program following completion of 
the program. A qualified provider would be defined as a provider of a 
high technology program that has been operational for at least 2 years; 
has successfully provided the high technology program for at least one 
year; and meets the approval criteria developed by VA. VA would be 
required to give preference to a qualified provider that offers tuition 
reimbursement for students who complete a program of education offered 
by the provider and do not find full-time meaningful employment in the 
field of study of the program within the 180-days after completing the 
program. Each Veteran enrolled in a high technology program of 
education under the pilot program on a full-time basis would receive a 
monthly housing stipend as follows: in the case of a Veteran pursuing 
resident training, the monthly amount of the basic allowance for 
housing payable under section 403 of title 37 U.S.C. for a member with 
dependents in pay grade E-5 residing in the military housing area that 
encompasses all or the majority portion of the zip code area in which 
is located the institution at which the individual is enrolled; or in 
the case of a Veteran pursuing a program of education through distance 
learning, a monthly amount equal to 50 percent of the amount payable to 
a Veteran enrolled full-time pursuing resident training. This bill 
would require VA to submit to Congress a report on the pilot program 
not later than one year after the date of enactment and annually 
thereafter. The bill would authorize an appropriation of $15 million 
for each fiscal year during which the pilot program operates. The 
authority to carry out the pilot program would terminate 5 years after 
the date on which VA first enters into a contract under this bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA has significant concerns regarding the implementation and 
administration of the pilot program. First, section 114 would apply to 
all Veterans entitled to assistance under any VA education program. 
However, it would also require payment of the Post-9/11 GI Bill MHA, 
which is a marked departure from the rates currently payable under 
programs other than the Post-9/11 GI Bill. VA recommends that section 
114 apply only to covered individuals under the Post 9/11 GI Bill. 
Second, section 114 would require VA to manage contracts and pay 
providers that are not IHLs. Given the scope of the pilot program, VA 
would have to hire additional FTEs to manage the program. Finally, VA 
estimates that it would require 12 to 18 months from the date of 
enactment to make the IT system changes necessary to implement section 
114 and the acquisition timeline for $15 million in contracts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 114 does not specify whether the mandatory Readjustment 
Benefits account, discretionary VBA GOE account, or a mixture of both 
would be used to fund the pilot program. However, direct costs of the 
pilot, including payments for contractors and housing allowance, are 
estimated to be $15 million in 2018 and $75 million over 5 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;TITLE II - OTHER EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
SECTION 201&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 201 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3485(a)(4) by removing the 
expiration date of June 30, 2022, for work-study allowances for 
Veterans pursuing VA programs of rehabilitation, education, or training 
who perform certain ``qualifying work-study activity,'' which includes 
outreach services for a State approving agency (SAA), providing 
hospital and domiciliary care and medical treatment to Veterans in a 
State home, or performing an activity relating to the administration of 
a national cemetery or a state Veterans' cemetery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 201 because it would permanently authorize 
work-study allowances for individuals who are performing work-study 
activities that involve providing services to or on behalf of 
Servicemembers and Veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Benefit costs are estimated to be $0 in FY 2018, $277,000 over 5 
years, and $6.6 million over 10 years. There are no additional FTE or 
GOE costs associated with this section.
SECTION 202&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 202 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3511(a)(1) to provide 
educational assistance under the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational 
Assistance (DEA) program for 36 months for individuals who first enroll 
in programs of education using such benefits on or after August 1, 
2018. Individuals who first enrolled in a program of education prior to 
August 1, 2018, would still qualify for a maximum of 45 months of 
entitlement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 202 as this would bring the amount of 
entitlement under the DEA program in line with the maximum number of 
months of entitlement under all other VA educational assistance 
programs. VA would need to make modifications to the BDN in order to 
implement section 202.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this 
section.
SECTION 203&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 203 would increase the amounts of educational assistance 
payable for pursuit of institutional courses under the DEA program. An 
eligible person would be entitled to a monthly allowance of $1,224 for 
full-time coursework, $967 for 3-quarter time, and $710 for half-time 
coursework. The increases would be effective August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 203, subject to the availability the funds, 
because it would provide additional funding for individuals currently 
utilizing the benefit for pursuit of these types of programs. These 
rates were last increased in 2003 and have only been increased through 
an annual cost of living allowance in subsequent years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this 
section.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;TITLE III - ADMINISTRATION OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
SECTION 301&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 301 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3674(a) to provide that 
reasonable and necessary salary and travel expenses of SAA employees 
and local agencies that VA has agreed to pay would be payable out of 
appropriated amounts as well as from amounts available for payment of 
readjustment expenses. Section 301 would authorize $3 million in 
appropriated funds per fiscal year, and the maximum total amount 
available under section 3674 for any fiscal year would be increased 
from $19 million to $21 million. Beginning in FY 2019, the maximum 
total amount available for these expenses would increase by the same 
percentage as the annual increase in the benefit amounts payable under 
title II of the Social Security Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 301 as it would provide additional Federal 
funding in support of SAA duties. The current budgetary allocation of 
$19 million, unchanged since 2007, has not kept up with the 
inflationary pressures experienced by state governments. SAAs must have 
the necessary funding to maintain their critical mission. VA believes 
the proposed increase in the funding level and the annual appropriation 
would prove sufficient to cover both inflationary pressures and the 
SAA's expanded workload.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this 
section. We believe, however, that the language in new section 
3674(a)(4) and (a)(5) requires further clarification. On the one hand, 
new section 3674(a)(4) would state authorize appropriations of $3 
million ``[i]n addition to'' the $21 million provided for in new 
section 3674(a)(5). On the other hand, section 3674(a)(5) would state 
that the ``total amount made available under this section for any 
fiscal year shall be $21 million.'' It is unclear therefore whether 
appropriated funds for SAA funding would be $21 million plus the $3 
million authorized in annual appropriations under section 3674(a)(4) or 
whether only $21 million would be available.
SECTION 302&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 302 of this bill would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3680A(a)(4) to 
authorize the use of Post-9/11 educational assistance to pursue 
accredited independent study programs at the following educational 
institutions that are not IHLs: area career and technical education 
schools as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec.  2302(3) that provide post-
secondary level education and postsecondary vocational institutions as 
defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec.  1002(c). Currently, under section 
3680A(a)(4), the Secretary may only approve enrollment in an 
``accredited independent study program (including open circuit 
television) leading (A) to a standard college degree, or (B) to a 
certificate that reflects educational attainment offered by an 
institution of higher learning.'' As such, VA is not authorized to pay 
educational assistance for independent study courses at an institution 
that is not considered to be an IHL.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 302, subject to the availability of funds. This 
section would expand VA's approval authority to pay Post-9/11 GI Bill 
benefits for enrollment in accredited independent study certificate 
programs at educational institutions that are not IHLs but are 
accredited by an accreditor recognized by the Secretary of Education 
and at career and technical schools that lead to industry-recognized 
credentials and certificates for employment. VA understands and 
appreciates the importance of career and technical education courses 
and the growth in the utilization of online and other 21st century 
training modalities in the delivery of instruction for both degree and 
non-degree programs. As such, expanding the approval authority for 
certain independent study programs would be in the best interests of VA 
education beneficiaries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;We note that, because section 302 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  
3680A, the expansion of benefits would not be limited to Post-9/11 GI 
Bill benefits. If the intent of section 302 is to limit this expansion 
to chapter 33 beneficiaries, the provision should be codified in 
chapter 33 or the bill should be revised to incorporate this 
limitation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no FTE and GOE costs requirements associated with this 
section.
SECTION 303&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 303 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3698(c)(1)(C) to require VA 
to improve outreach and transparency to Veterans and Servicemembers by 
providing information on whether an IHL administers a priority 
enrollment system that allows certain student Veterans to enroll in 
courses earlier than other students.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 303. VA's GI Bill Comparison Tool currently 
enables prospective students to compare educational institutions using 
key measures of affordability and value through access to school 
performance information and consumer protection information. Providing 
information about priority enrollment for Veterans would further help 
Veterans become informed post-secondary education consumers. VA would 
need to make modifications to the GI Bill Comparison Tool to include 
information on priority enrollments. VA estimates that it would need 
one year from enactment to make these changes.
SECTION 304&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 304 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3684(c) to revise 
requirements governing reporting fees payable to educational 
institutions and joint apprenticeship training committees. Section 304 
would increase the annual fee to $16 for each eligible individual 
enrolled in VA's education and vocational rehabilitation and employment 
programs. Section 304 would prohibit an educational institution or a 
sponsor of a program of apprenticeship with 100 or more enrollees from 
using reporting fees from VA for or merging such fees with the amounts 
available for the general fund of the educational institution or 
sponsor of a program of apprenticeship. This section would be effective 
on August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 304 because it would prohibit schools and 
sponsors of apprenticeship programs from using reporting fees for, or 
merging such fees with, their general funds. Educational institutions 
and sponsors of apprenticeship programs are required to use reporting 
fees solely for making certifications or otherwise supporting programs 
for Veterans, and this would ensure that the reporting fees are used 
solely for those purposes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this 
section.
SECTION 305&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 305 would authorize VA, in consultation with the SAAs, to 
provide training requirements for school certifying officials employed 
by covered educational institutions that offer courses of education 
approved under chapter 36 of title 38 U.S.C. If an educational 
institution does not ensure that a school certifying official meets the 
training requirements, VA may disapprove any course of education 
offered by the educational institution. A ``covered educational 
institution'' would refer to an educational institution that has 
enrolled 20 or more individuals using VA educational assistance, and a 
``school certifying official'' would be defined as an employee of an 
educational institution with primary responsibility for certifying 
Veteran enrollment at the educational institution. This section would 
be effective on August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 305. VA currently provides guidance and 
training opportunities for school certifying officials via webinars, 
the School Certifying Official Handbook, and on the GI Bill website, 
but does not have the authority to require school certifying officials 
to complete this training or to disapprove educational programs if the 
training is not completed. Section 305 would provide VA with the 
authority to require school certifying officials to meet certain 
training requirements as determined by VA. VA suggests that the 
proposed requirements be codified in chapter 36 of title 38 U.S.C.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;No benefit costs are associated with this section. There are no 
additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this section.
SECTION 306&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 306 of the bill would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3692(c) to 
extend the authorization for the Veterans' Advisory Committee on 
Education (VACOE) through December 31, 2022. VACOE provides advice to 
the Secretary on the administration of education and training programs 
for Veterans and Servicemembers, members of the National Guard and 
Reserve Components, and dependents of Veterans under chapters 30, 32, 
33, and 35 of title 38 U.S.C. and chapter 1606 of title 10, United 
States Code.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 306. If authorization for the VACOE is 
extended, the Secretary would be able to continue to receive 
recommendations and seek advice from VACOE in order to enhance VA's 
educational assistance programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;No benefit costs are associated with this section. GOE costs for 
the first year are expected to be $51,000 and include oversight, member 
operations, travel, and other fees for 10 members of the VACOE. 5 year 
costs are estimated to be $255,000.
SECTION 307&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 307 would amend chapter 36 of title 38 U.S.C. to add a new 
section, 3697B, titled ``On-campus educational and vocational 
counseling.'' New 38 U.S.C. 3697B would: (1) require VA to provide 
educational and vocational counseling services for individuals 
described in 38 U.S.C. 3697A at locations on IHL campuses as selected 
by VA; (2) provide criteria for the selection of IHLs to participate in 
these services; and (3) require that no later than 180 days after 
enactment, and each year thereafter, VA will submit a report to the 
Congress regarding the average ratio of counselors providing these 
services to individuals who receive these services at each location, a 
description of the services provided, and recommendations for improving 
the provision of these services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports the objectives of providing eligible participants with 
quality, readily available counseling services. However, we believe 
that section 307 would duplicate the VetSuccess on Campus (VSOC) 
program, which VA already administers under the Secretary's authority 
in 38 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  3115 and 3116. VSOC aims to help Veterans, 
Servicemembers, and their qualified dependents succeed and thrive 
through a coordinated delivery of on-campus benefits assistance and 
counseling, leading to completion of their education and preparing them 
to enter the labor market in viable careers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA, however, remains concerned that the VSOC program is not 
separately funded and continues to leverage existing Vocational 
Rehabilitation and Employment counselors to fill VSOC positions. In 
addition, VA does not believe that reporting on the ratio of 
individuals served to counselors would accurately reflect the amount of 
services provided because counselors often have multiple contacts with 
an individual and handle multiple issues for the individual. We believe 
that it would be more accurate to report on the number of contacts in 
which services were provided by a counselor.
SECTION 308&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 308 would add a new section 3699A to title 38 U.S.C. that 
would require VA to make available to educational institutions offering 
courses of education that have been approved for educational assistance 
to which a Veteran or individual is entitled information about the 
amount of educational assistance to which a Veteran or individual is 
entitled. This information would be provided to the educational 
institution through a secure IT system accessible by the educational 
institution and would be updated regularly to reflect any amounts used 
by the Veteran or other individual. A Veteran or other individual 
pursuing a course of education may elect not to provide the information 
to an educational institution in a manner prescribed by VA. This 
section would be effective August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports the intent of section 308. However, section 308 would 
present implementation challenges for VA. Currently, VA provides the 
amount of a Veteran's entitlement (original and remaining) and other 
information such as the delimiting date for educational assistance to 
the educational institution in which the individual is enrolled through 
VA-ONCE. This information is available for individuals training under 
chapter 30 of title 38 U.S.C.and chapters 1606 and 1607 of title 10 
U.S.C. after VA processes an award for education benefits. This 
functionality is not currently available for Veterans or other 
individuals training under chapters 32, 33, or 35 of title 38 U.S.C.; 
therefore, VA would need to make programming changes to VA-ONCE in 
order to make this information available for these individuals as well, 
and also ensure that the information is not provided to educational 
institutions for those individuals who make an election not to provide 
information. We note in this regard that there are very few individuals 
who remain eligible for chapter 32 benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;No benefit costs are associated with this section. There are no 
additional FTE or GOE costs associated with this section.
SECTION 309&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 309 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3684(a) to require 
educational institutions to treat a course that begins 7 or fewer days 
before or after the first day of the academic term as if it began on 
the first day of the academic term for purposes of reporting enrollment 
under 3684.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA understands that section 309 would eliminate the separate 
reporting requirement for courses that begin seven or fewer days before 
the first day of an academic term. We note however that VA policy 
guidance currently does not require schools to separately certify 
classes that begin within 7 calendar days after the start of the term, 
quarter, or semester. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the amended 
section 3684(a) would not change the period(s) for which VA educational 
assistance can be paid, which are codified in 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3680(a) 
and in the various education benefit chapters. As a result, the 
information reported under the amended section 3684(a) would be 
inconsistent with the periods for which VA can award educational 
assistance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;TITLE IV - RESERVE COMPONENT BENEFITS
SECTION 401&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 401 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3301(1)(B), to include, in 
the case of members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces, 
service on active duty under a call or order to active duty under 10 
U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  12304a and 12304b as service constituting active duty 
for purposes of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Section 401 would apply to 
such service in the Armed Forces occurring on or after the after the 
enactment of the Post- 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 
2008, and entitlement to such benefits could be used to pursue a course 
of education beginning on or after August 1, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 401 of the bill, subject to the availability of 
funds. Under current law, 2 reserve component (RC) members who are 
serving side-by-side on active duty may not receive similar benefits 
under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The active duty time of an RC member who 
volunteers for active duty under 10 U.S.C. Sec.  12301(d) is counted 
towards the aggregate time required to establish Post-9/11 GI Bill 
eligibility, while the active duty time of an RC member who was 
involuntarily activated under 10 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  12304a or 12304b for 
similar duty does not count toward establishing Post-9/11 GI Bill 
eligibility. Section 401 would allow RC members who are involuntarily 
activated under 10 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  12304a and 12304b to receive the 
same benefits as those RC members who have volunteered to perform duty 
under 10 U.S.C. Sec.  12301(d).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The LTS would need to be programmed in order to calculate 
eligibility based on service under 10 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  12304a and 
12304b and to limit awards of educational assistance based on such 
service to programs pursued on or after August 1, 2018.
SECTION 402&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 402 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3103(f) to extend the 
eligibility period for participation in a vocational rehabilitation 
program for RC members who are ordered to active duty under 10 U.S.C. 
Sec. Sec.  12304a and 12304b by the length of time the RC members serve 
on active duty plus 4 months.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 402. Currently, 38 U.S.C. Sec.  3103(f) 
provides for an extension of the eligibility period for vocational 
rehabilitation and employment benefits for reservists who are ordered 
to active duty under certain provisions of title 10 U.S.C. Section 402 
would provide the same extended eligibility period for reservists who 
are prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilitation program 
during their period of eligibility because they are ordered to active 
duty to provide assistance in response to a major disaster or emergency 
or to augment the active forces for preplanned missions in support of 
combatant commands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;TITLE V - OTHER MATTERS
SECTION 501&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Section 501 would make any modification of the amount of the basic 
allowance for housing (BAH) inside the United States applicable to 
benefits administered by VA. Section 501 would take effect on January 
1, 2018, and apply to individuals who first use their entitlement on or 
after that date.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;VA supports section 501, subject to Congress finding appropriate 
offsets. This legislation would align the maximum MHA rate for full-
time training under the Post-9/11 GI Bill with DoD's BAH rate for an E-
5 with dependents. The MHA and BAH rates have been out of alignment for 
a few years, which has led to confusion on the part of Post-9/11 GI 
Bill beneficiaries. The LTS would need to be programmed in order to 
calculate MHA based on whether the individual first used entitlement on 
or after January 1, 2018, or prior to that date.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;There are no FTE and GOE costs requirements associated with this 
section, but would incur some IT costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This concludes our statement, Mr. Chairman. We would be happy now 
to entertain any questions you or the other members of the Subcommittee 
may have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;&amp;lt;F-dash&amp;gt;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Prepared Statement of Patrick D. Murray&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and distinguished members of the 
Committee, on behalf of the men and women of the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars of the United States (VFW) and its Auxiliary, thank you for the 
opportunity to present the VFW's thoughts on the pending GI Bill 
legislation.
Section 101&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports this section which would allow for National 
Guardsmen and Reservists ordered to active duty for medical treatment 
to receive the same educational benefits as their active duty 
counterparts. There are service members who were injured during their 
military service and who are convalescing at military treatment 
facilities throughout the country, but are not accruing the same 
educational benefits as other service members currently on active duty. 
Their time on active duty should be considered no different than any 
others and this legislation will make that possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This bill will rectify the mistake made by the Department of 
Defense (DOD) in putting National Guardsmen and Reservists on 12301(h) 
orders which exempt them from benefits in order to save money. DOD 
should not have used this cost cutting measure because it is 
detrimental to our troops' morale and welfare. The VFW endorses any 
legislation like this that will ensure full benefits for our troops 
while they are away from their civilian lives on active duty.
Section 102&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW agrees with the intent of this section which would increase 
the rates of educational benefits provided to National Guardsmen and 
Reservists. Educating our veteran population is one of the VFW's 
highest priorities, and we are happy this committee values education as 
a priority as well.
Section 103&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports this section increasing the rate of educational 
benefits for recipients of the Purple Heart. For the past decade and a 
half, our country has been sending National Guardsmen and Reservists 
into harm's way at an unprecedented level, and some of them have been 
wounded in the line of duty. Nearly 3,000 of these Citizen Soldiers 
have bled for this country, but have not accrued enough active duty 
time to attain full GI Bill benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW thinks that service men and women who have bled for this 
country should be compensated for their injuries by granting them full 
education benefits. This is the least we as a country can do for those 
who put their bodies on the line for our freedoms.
Section 104&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Veterans who lost entitlements while pursuing education through the 
Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) should be allowed to have 
their benefits restored. Allowing those that lost the benefit the 
ability to recoup their eligibility and switch into chapter 33 is a 
straightforward, common sense solution to address this problem.
Section 105&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW would ask that more research be done on how many student 
veterans would be affected by this change and how much money would 
increase or decrease. There have been cases where school recruiters 
have sought out new students with the promise of making more money in 
their housing stipend based on zip code differences. Students should 
not choose their schools based on Basic Allowance for Housing rates; 
they should choose their schools based on the value of education they 
would receive. However, adjusting this rule could have some unintended 
consequences to veterans through no fault of their own. Making a change 
to the housing stipend with regard to the location of schools without 
doing the due diligence as to how many veterans this would affect is a 
hasty decision, and we would like to see additional information before 
we make a decision to support this portion of the legislation.
Section 106&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports this section which would change the structure of 
charging for the costs of the tests and certifications veterans apply 
for, instead of a months' worth of eligibility from their GI Bill. The 
GI Bill pays for books, labs and fees for student veterans attending 
college. This bill would include test fees in the GI Bill payment 
structure, and would provide a savings to the government and also allow 
student veterans to retain GI Bill eligibility, instead of having to 
use it for a test fee.
Section 107&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW strongly supports this section to protect student veterans 
who were negatively affected by school closures. Recently ITT Technical 
Institute and Westech College suddenly shuttered their doors after 
losing accreditation. This left thousands of student veterans out of 
school mid-semester, with no plan for what to do the rest of the term. 
They had lost weeks or months of GI Bill benefits that were wasted at 
failed institutions. Even worse, they lost the monthly housing stipend 
many relied upon for their living situation. This legislation allows 
these affected student veterans to recoup their lost months of GI Bill 
eligibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;While we support this initiative, we do not feel it goes far 
enough. We think student veterans should be able to recoup the months 
of eligibility wasted at the closed institutions just like traditional 
students can with Pell Grants. Student veterans who attended schools 
like ITT have now lost those months of GI Bill eligibility and they 
have no credits to show for it. The VFW has heard from student veterans 
from the closed schools, and they are now struggling to complete their 
degrees without their previous credits. GI Bill eligibility should be 
allowed to be recouped like Chapter Four Pell Grants can be by 
traditional students. Student veterans deserve the same equity as every 
other student affected by school closures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Additionally, these student veterans now have no monthly income 
from their GI Bill benefits. The VFW strongly supports extending the 
Basic Allowance for Housing payments for a maximum of four months or 
until the end of the term, whichever is earliest. Our team at the VFW 
immediately reached out to the student veterans affected by each of the 
school closures and offered them a stopgap measure through our Unmet 
Needs Program. We provided the student veterans with some financial 
stability to make it through the next month or so while they got 
settled after this major life upheaval. This was, however, only a band-
aid for the real problem. These student veterans need protection for 
the future so issues like this do not affect them as badly as these 
past closures have.
Section 108&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports this section that offers additional financial 
assistance for the children of our fallen heroes. The Fry Scholarship 
gives 100 percent GI Bill benefits to the children and spouses of 
fallen service members who gave their lives serving our country. While 
this is a great benefit for the families of the fallen, there are some 
cases where financially it is not enough.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This legislation would bridge the gap, so the children or spouses 
who are eligible for the Fry Scholarship would not have to pay any out-
of-pocket costs to achieve their educational goals. Allowing recipients 
of the Fry Scholarship eligibility to the Yellow Ribbon Program is just 
a very small measure that does not even begin to repay the sacrifice 
their service member made for our country.
Section 109&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW agrees with the intent of this section which would allow 
for the transfer of benefits to a surviving child after the loss of 
another child. The loss of a child is such an unimaginable tragedy that 
allowing the transference of benefits to a surviving child is only a 
small measure of relief that we feel is completely reasonable. If a 
veteran has already transferred their benefits to one child, it should 
be in their right to move the benefit to another child in cases of 
death.
Section 110&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW strongly supports this provision to grant additional months 
of GI Bill eligibility for student veterans pursuing degrees in 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). Our nation is making 
a push to encourage more students to pursue STEM degrees in order to be 
competitive and outpace other nations around the world. Student 
veterans should be at the forefront of this initiative. In order to 
make this a possibility, there needs to be some additional eligibility 
granted for those pursuing these degrees, because STEM programs often 
take longer than the traditional four years to complete a bachelor's 
degree. The VFW wants to see student veterans succeed at the highest 
levels, and extending school eligibility in this case may be necessary 
to complete these highly important degrees.
Section 111&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The current GI Bill has a 15-year, use-it-or-lose-it time limit on 
the benefit. This arbitrary cap negatively impacts those veterans 
looking to use their educational benefit later on in life. Veterans 
should not be punished for successfully transitioning shortly after 
their service, and choosing to go back to school afterwards. This 
legislation would eliminate the 15-year limit and allow the GI Bill to 
be used whenever a veteran chooses, making this truly a forever GI 
Bill.
Section 112&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports prorating the monthly eligibility for those 
service members called up on involuntary orders. National Guardsmen and 
Reservists should not lose an entire month of eligibility if they are 
not using the entire month due to activation orders. These service 
members should have that month prorated so they can still retain some 
of the eligibility.
Section 113&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW strongly supports the improvement of Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) information technology (IT) systems. Time and time again, 
VA has failed to accurately account for millions of dollars of wrongful 
payments due to outdated IT systems. Any efforts to enhance the IT 
systems and bring them into the 21st century is strongly supported by 
the VFW. We would like to see this fixed as soon as possible in order 
to save taxpayer money and alleviate repayment burdens from veterans 
attending school.
Section 114&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports this section as it would provide new job 
opportunities in expanding fields for the future. Creating innovative 
ways that service members and veterans can achieve training and 
proficiency in new technology-related fields is essential for the 
future of our country and those who served it. The VFW would like to 
see this program move forward, and we highly endorse the input from the 
State Approving Agencies (SAA), which are instrumental in ensuring the 
value and validity of programs like this. The SAA is tasked with 
overseeing programs such as this and we would like their agencies' 
approval before moving completely forward with this as a permanent 
program.
Section 201&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section is a simple extension of VA's authority to offer work-
study allowances for student veterans. The VFW has long supported VA's 
work-study program, and we would proudly support this initiative to 
extend the program to 2027. Work-study is a valuable tool for student 
veterans to support valuable initiatives in and around their school 
community and earn extra income while taking classes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;While the VFW supports this addition, we would like to see the end 
date for this program extended indefinitely. There should not be any 
time in the foreseeable future where there are not veterans attending 
schools after their enlistments, so we do not see any time where work-
study would not be an added value to student veterans.
Section 202&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW has no position on this section.
Section 203&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports increasing the payments made to survivors and 
dependents for educational benefits. As the years have gone on, there 
has not been a significant increase in the amount of money survivors 
and dependents receive as their educational benefit. It is beyond time 
to make an increase in payments so as to keep pace with the rising cost 
of present day college tuitions.
Section 301&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports increasing the funding allocated to the State 
Approving Agencies. These agencies are the first line in ensuring 
schools are properly accredited and providing a high standard of 
education for student veterans. There have been thousands of student 
veterans left out on their own after their schools closed, sometimes 
with little or no notice. The SAA's role is to make sure that 
institutions are accredited and providing the services they claim to 
provide. For that reason, the VFW endorses additional funding in the 
hopes that school closures like ITT do not affect veterans in the 
future. While this section proposes an increase of three million 
dollars, the VFW would like to see the added funding be seven million 
dollars in order to strengthen the SAAs even more.
Section 302&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports the development and authorization of an 
independent study program that would further advance a veteran's 
education. We realize that not every class has to be taken in a 
traditional brick and mortar institution, and innovative programs like 
this would provide a new opportunity for veterans to succeed.
Section 303&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports authorizing veterans using GI Bill benefits to 
enroll in classes before the standard enrollment date. Veterans have a 
finite time to use their education benefits, and being locked out of 
required classes due to capacity issues is a real problem for student 
veterans. An easy way to avoid this is to allow veterans using the GI 
Bill to enroll earlier than the general student body, so as to make 
sure they do not get denied entrance into their required classes. 
Providing study results that show this as a viable option would be an 
excellent path forward for veterans, and is something the VFW would 
gladly support.
Section 304&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports the limitation of reporting fees for general 
school uses. At the beginning of each term, a School Certifying 
Official (SCO) reports the enrollment of a GI Bill user to VA. This 
enrollment signifies the usage of educational benefits for the 
individual. After this is complete, the school receives a $12 payment 
from VA for certifying the enrollment. Currently, there is no 
limitation on where that money is disbursed within the school's system. 
This legislation would ensure that schools are not using that reporting 
fee for their own general use. The VFW supports the plan to limit the 
usage of those fees for veteran services only. This would add to the 
amount of money available for veteran programs within those 
institutions.
Section 305&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports mandatory training for SCOs. In 2014 alone, there 
were $262 million dollars in erroneous Post-9/11 GI Bill payments to 
students and most times the students, not the schools, are the ones 
burdened with repaying the money. Making sure the SCO's are properly 
trained is one step in avoiding overpayments, and the VFW supports this 
action. While this legislation does not specifically address the source 
of funding for this training, the VFW thinks the schools themselves 
should be responsible for the cost of the training
Section 306&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports extending the authority of the Advisory Committee 
on Education until 2022. This is a valuable asset the VA Secretary can 
use to gather information and advice on how student veterans are using 
their education benefits, and the committee can advise on any changes 
or improvements that may be needed. The VFW supports this committee and 
would like to see its authority extended indefinitely. Student veterans 
will always be going to school, so we think this committee should 
always be present.
Section 307&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports adding vocational and educational counselors to 
campuses to further expand the resources available to student veterans. 
Student veterans sometimes face an uphill fight to transition from 
service to school. Having an additional knowledge base the veterans can 
lean on is an incredible tool that will only help those veterans 
succeed in their goals.
Section 308&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports giving SCOs access to student veteran' records in 
order to appropriately counsel the students on their entitlements. As 
student veterans progress through their educational journey, there are 
often times they seek help or have questions. Student or academic 
advisors do not have the ability look up the student veterans' VA 
eligibility, so allowing the SCO's to do so is a great help. The SCO's 
should already have familiarity with student veterans and their needs, 
so installing the ability to view their records should be a seamless 
addition.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;While the VFW supports improving the access to veterans' academic 
eligibility, we do not see why there should be a cost associated with 
this. Allowing SCO's to log into VA's system to check on eligibility 
should not cost millions of dollars. We agree with the process, but not 
the cost.
Section 309&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports allowing leniency in school start dates in terms 
of processing and payments. Schools across the country are allowed to 
begin their school years at varying times. A school that is allowed to 
start the term a day or so later than other schools should not reflect 
upon the student veteran attending that school. Allowing VA to treat 
start dates the same across different schools will help the students 
and VA itself in simplifying this process.
Section 401&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW strongly supports this legislation that would correct the 
oversight of the Department of Defense by cutting service members' 
benefits while on active duty orders. National Guardsmen and Reservists 
were placed on involuntary activation orders that did not allow them to 
accrue benefits through time and service like their active duty 
counterparts. While stationed abroad and away from their homes and 
families, these troops were denied the ability to gain educational 
credit for use after demobilization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;12304(b) orders need to be amended to keep the activation 
authority, but reinstitute the benefits that were removed. Thousands of 
National Guardsmen and Reservists have been involuntarily activated 
under these orders and have not received benefits equal to their active 
duty counterparts. More and more, DOD is using our nation's reserve 
component to fight our decade and a half war against terror, and for 
these men and women to come home without equal benefits is something 
that must change.
Section 501&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The VFW supports the repeal of Subsection (b) of section 604 of the 
Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2015. This change does not cut benefits and covers 
the cost of these great additions to the GI Bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony. I am prepared to take 
any questions you or the members of the committee may have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;&amp;lt;F-dash&amp;gt;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Prepared Statement of William Hubbard&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz and Members of the Committee:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Thank you for inviting Student Veterans of America (SVA) to submit 
our testimony on the modernization of the GI Bill and other pending 
legislation. With over 1,400 chapters representing the nearly 1.1 
million student veterans in schools across the country, we are pleased 
to share the perspective of those directly impacted by the subjects 
before this committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Established in 2008, SVA has grown to become a force and voice for 
the interests of veterans in higher education. With a myriad of 
programs supporting their success, rigorous research on ways to improve 
the landscape, and advocacy throughout the nation, we place the student 
veteran at the top of our organizational pyramid. As the future leaders 
of this country, fostering the success of veterans in school is 
paramount in their preparation for productive and impactful lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;We will discuss our unwavering interest in achieving a GI Billr for 
all future veterans, along with other policy proposals to expand 
education access for Purple Heart recipients, Guard and Reserve 
members, school closure students, and survivors. Since the passage of 
the Post-9/11 GI Bill in 2008, SVA has been working with a coalition of 
higher education and veteran organizations to improve the GI Bill for 
generations to come, including discussions that began in 2016 with the 
veteran community about making the GI Bill permanent. We also strongly 
support the removal of the arbitrary 15-year time limit on using this 
earned benefit, a provision that will truly make this program 
``Forever''.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Our National Veteran Education Success Tracker (NVEST) research 
demonstrates that the GI Bill has a high return on investment for 
veterans and the country-a program worth ensuring for all generations 
to come. \1\ As the most recently transitioned generation of veterans, 
student veterans are ambassadors to the all-volunteer force, and 
recognize the value of this investment.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;SVA and the over 1.1 million student veterans in school today look 
forward to working with congress and the wider community to make this 
proposed expansion a reality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 101. Consideration of certain time spent receiving medical 
care from Secretary of Defense as active duty for purposes of 
eligibility for Post 9/11 Educational Assistance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section proposes amending title 38, United States Code, to 
consider certain time spent by members of reserve components of the 
Armed Forces while receiving medical care from the Secretary of Defense 
as active duty for purposes of eligibility for Post-9/11 Educational 
Assistance. The missing code of 12301(h) was a known problem as early 
as October 2014, documented in an October 1, 2014 Reserve Forces Policy 
Board memorandum. SVA maintains a hard stance on addressing this issue 
immediately, and looks forward to seeing a solution passed this year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 102. Consolidation of certain eligibility tiers under Post-9/
11 Educational Assistance Program of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section proposes to amend title 38, United States Code, to 
consolidate certain eligibility tiers under the Post-9/11 Educational 
Assistance Program. For reservists, the opportunity to serve on active 
duty and earn GI Bill benefits may be limited for some, while the wider 
reserve components continue to be an integral component of the overall 
global Department of Defense posture. This proposal recognizes the 
importance that National Guard and Reserve Members play in the 
protection of our nation in service overseas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The modified tiers of eligibility would provide 10% increases, 
specifically for those who serve on active duty up to 12 months. The 
minimum threshold of benefits would be increased up to 50% eligibility 
for those who serve between three to six months (see table below for 
reference). Our research indicates that student veterans are 
quintessentially non-traditional students, which often includes 
significant financial obligations and costs associated with raising 
families. \2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The increase in education benefits at the lower tiers makes 
achieving educational success a significantly more attainable goal. The 
reserves of the U.S. Armed Forces has been greatly tested as our 
country has been at war for well over a decade. Many of these 
reservists have the opportunity to apply their education in the service 
of our nation as they are mobilized for deployments, making this 
increase a direct impact to the overall national security of the 
country as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 103. Educational assistance under Post-9/11 Educational 
Assistance Program for members of the Armed Forces awarded the Purple 
Heart.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would acknowledge the sacrifice of men and women who 
have served our country with dignity, sustaining battlefield injuries. 
Currently, only veterans who either served at least 36 months on active 
duty or are medically retired receive Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits at the 
100 percent rate, excluding nearly 3,000 Purple Heart recipients over 
the next ten years who may not meet these administrative requirements. 
In practice, this error penalizes men and women who were wounded before 
they could reach the full term of their contract to receive GI Bill 
eligibility. SVA believes that those who shed blood in our country's 
defense should have the opportunity to go to school. For those who have 
sacrificed their own self in service, we strongly believe those men and 
women have fully met the service requirement for GI Bill eligibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 104. Eligibility for Post-9/11 Educational Assistance for 
certain members of reserve components of Armed Forces who lost 
entitlement to educational assistance under Reserve Educational 
Assistance Program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would allow members of the National Guard and Reserves 
who lost benefits under the Reserve Educational Assistance Program 
(REAP) as a result of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 to 
access Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Individuals who have experienced a 
loss of earned benefits due to technical oversights have resulted in 
many student veterans losing access to education. This section would 
fix this gap for these students, and provide the critical opportunity 
to return to school, a much-needed fix.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 105. Calculation of monthly housing stipend under Post-9/11 
Educational Assistance Program based on location of campus where 
classes are attended.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would adjust the calculation of the monthly housing 
stipend under Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Program based on 
location of campus where classes are attended. Currently this disparity 
exists between where a veteran physically attends classes and resides, 
and the monthly stipend provided under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;For example, a veteran could be enrolled at an online institution 
of higher learning (IHL) based in San Francisco, while living in a 
rural district of North Dakota; in such a case, the individual would 
receive substantially higher Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) than 
necessary, inflating the programs costs unnecessarily. During a visit 
to our Student Veterans of America chapters in Hawaii, it was 
discovered that options at local campuses were limited; while students 
sought to attend programs online through leading universities, the low 
rate of BAH based on the location of the university, not the student, 
greatly limited the opportunities of these geographically displaced 
student veterans. Unfortunately, this scenario is all too common, while 
others are earning BAH at much higher rates compared to their locality. 
It is our position that students should not be profiting off of GI Bill 
payments, as they exist for the purpose of allowing individuals to 
attend school.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Additionally, we have seen too many instances of this disparity in 
BAH calculation encouraging abusive behavior on the part of several 
schools who locate the IHL address in a high-BAH district, while 
offering the physical course delivery in a low-BAH location while using 
the lucrative BAH stipend as a recruiting incentive. The converse of 
this situation is also a major point of contention, and results in harm 
to the student veteran while enrolled in an IHL as we have 
demonstrated. We support this legislation which would adjust the 
calculation to account for the reality of the living situation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 106. Charge to entitlement for certain licensure and 
certification tests and national tests under Department of Veterans 
Affairs Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would allow veterans to apply their GI Bill benefits 
to afford the cost of certain licensure and certification tests and 
national tests. Under the current system, veterans who seek to apply 
their GI Bill benefits to the cost of taking certification or licensing 
tests are charged an entire month of their entitlement, regardless of 
how comparatively low the cost of such test is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;It is common sense that veterans would be able to pro-rate the cost 
of that charge and retain the remaining value of that month's benefit. 
This measure will prevent veterans from being dissuaded by the current 
overcharging inconsistency, and instead encourage taking critical tests 
necessary for career development without paying costs out of pocket. 
SVA is fully in support of this common-sense solution, which preserves 
valuable earned benefits for future education requirements.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 107. Restoration of entitlement to educational assistance and 
other relief for veterans affected by school closure or disapproval.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would allow for the restoration of entitlement to GI 
Bill benefits for student veterans affected by closures of educational 
institutions. When 28 IHLs under the Corinthian Colleges system closed, 
there were hundreds of student veterans that were using Post-9/11 GI 
Bill benefits to attend one of those IHLs. Many of these affected 
students now find themselves stranded, with their lives on-hold. The VA 
Secretary currently does not have the authority to provide meaningful 
relief to student veterans who find themselves in such a situation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The proposal will apply to veterans receiving GI Bill benefits 
while pursuing a program of education at an IHL that closed, or who 
withdrew from a closed IHL within 120 days of the closure, to fully 
restore for tuition payments. Veterans who complete their program of 
education at another IHL pursuant to a teach-out plan would not be 
eligible for relief. VA would also have the authority to identify other 
students veterans who were harmed by their IHL and may be eligible for 
such relief.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;SVA additionally recommends the inclusion of a provision granting 
VA the authority to bring appropriate action against an IHL to recover 
the expenses of providing relief. To ensure that student veterans who 
have already been harmed can receive relief, the bill would 
retroactively apply to anyone who received Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits 
beginning January 1, 2015, thereby covering the Corinthian school 
closures and those thereafter.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Congress must act to ensure that hard-earned GI Bill benefits are 
not squandered because of an IHL's failure to serve its students. SVA 
supports this measure with the conditions of expanding the timeframe to 
restore entitlement to those affected in the Corinthian closures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 108. Inclusion of Fry Scholarship recipients in Yellow Ribbon 
G.I. Education Enhancement Program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would amend title 38, United States Code, to include 
the Fry Scholarship in the Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement 
Program. SVA stands with many other organizations in strong support of 
this legislation that would allow the dependents of a service member 
who died in the line of duty to access Yellow Ribbon Program benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship goes to 
families that have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country; we 
believe they have more than earned the right to attend an IHL of their 
choice without comparatively minor tuition costs hampering their 
success. This is a common-sense proposal; frankly it is ridiculous that 
that this error has existed for nearly a decade and not yet been 
amended. We look forward to this being expeditiously put into effect. 
SVA stands in vigorous support for this legislation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 109. Additional authorized transfer of unused Post-9/11 
Educational Assistance benefits to dependents upon death of originally 
designated dependent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This bill would authorize the transfer of unused benefits to 
dependents upon death of originally designated dependent. At present, 
in the tragic scenario when a veteran's dependent with transferred GI 
Bill benefits passes away without using the full extent of those 
benefits, the unused benefits become unusable. We believe this is an 
unintended consequence of the way the law is written, and vigorously 
support this correction, which honors the sacrifice of our military 
families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;SVA supports this technical correction for transferred GI Bill 
benefits. Currently, if a service member transfers their GI Bill while 
alive and subsequently passes, the allocation of benefits and amount 
allotted to surviving family members is locked in place indefinitely. 
If the service member or veteran were still living, they could simply 
adjust the number of months allotted to each family member at will. SVA 
recommends allowing those entitled to the transferred benefits to

additional component of this proposal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 110. Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This scholarship would be named after Edith Rogers, a long-time 
Massachusetts Member of Congress and drafter of the Original GI Bill in 
1944; Rep. Rogers espouses the spirit of the Got Your 6 empowerment 
campaign and their focus on empowering women veterans, \3\ #shesbadass. 
\4\ A true champion of veterans, she was one of the first women to 
serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, and completed her service 
after nearly 35 years in the House. This scholarship likewise presents 
veterans with an opportunity to achieve STEM degrees, and in the honor 
of a woman who equally sought to benefit the country in ways bigger 
than herself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide additional educational 
assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Program 
of VA to certain eligible individuals, specifically those seeking STEM 
(science, technology, engineering, and math) degrees. With the current 
resources provided by the GI Bill, the marginal cost of an additional 
academic year for student veterans pursuing STEM will yield the 
essential mass of leaders our country needs. Investing in an additional 
year for STEM-focused student veterans will ultimately result in 
economic gains and tighter national security, and supporting this 
section is the first step.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Presently, 16-20% of all undergraduate students are in pursuit of a 
STEM degree. While less than one fifth of current students seeking STEM 
degrees, even fewer achieve them since more than one third of the 
general population change their major before they graduate. Compare 
those numbers to what we learned from the research we published this 
year, the National Veteran Education Success Tracker (NVEST), we found 
that 14% sought STEM degrees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The aptitude and interest is clear-the resources to deliver more 
STEM graduates in the single major barrier to even greater numbers of 
STEM graduates \5\. According to a report from Georgetown University's 
Center of Education and the Workforce, ``The Economic Value of College 
Majors'', top-paying college majors earn a total $3.4 million more than 
the lowest-paying majors over a lifetime; the top ten highest paying 
majors are all in STEM fields, eight of which are in engineering \6\.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;In today's economic environment, the highest paying majors will 
earn graduates an average mid-career salary of $136,000. The lowest 
earning potential includes majors such as studio arts or human 
services. Such majors earn a mid-career salary of nearly $100,000 less 
per year. The tax revenue from STEM professionals alone suggests this 
is a beneficial proposal. The need for STEM-focused professionals with 
a commitment to service, and the leadership skills to make a difference 
has never been greater.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Our country faces a key decision point. We are currently affording 
veterans the opportunity to go to IHLs, but we must determine what 
shapes this new and dynamic workforce. After these veterans graduate, 
wouldn't we prefer that our country gains scientists, engineers, 
cybersecurity professionals, physicists, and other high-demand 
professionals? The marginal cost of an additional academic year is 
well-worth the added short-term cost, noting the long-term benefit to 
the economy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Veterans should not be forced to decide between continued service 
through a STEM career, and the financial burden that mitigates the 
value of their earned GI Bill benefits. It has long been our goal to 
see every veteran maximize the potential of their GI Bill, and this is 
the answer. It would otherwise take years to find other graduates with 
level of experience and knowledge that veterans already possess-time we 
simply do not have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The ability and expertise of these veterans, when coupled with a 
STEM education, will be an unparalleled force. Our service members are 
routinely exposed to highly technical equipment, processes, and 
environments, often with lives depending on their ability to succeed in 
high-pressure situations. We know they can, and do, succeed when given 
the opportunity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;When determining our support for this proposal, we consider the 
long-term economic impact of increased tax revenue from higher-paid 
STEM professionals; we consider the national security need for leaders 
in these fields; and we consider how the previous GI Bill prepared our 
country for the most modern workforce of its time. We know veterans 
have a demonstrated commitment to service, and the leadership skills 
necessary to make the country's STEM fields an unmatched force.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;SVA recognizes Rep. David McKinley (WV-1) and Rep. Dina Titus (NV-
1) for initially proposing this concept in 2015. Their foresight 
recognized the need and value of such a scholarship, and we look 
forward to the Rogers STEM Scholarship becoming a reality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 111. Honoring the national service of members of the Armed 
Forces by elimination of time limitation for use of entitlement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;We believe that veteran education benefits are not a cost of war, 
but instead a right of service. We believe that education opportunities 
should be a lifetime benefit, and thus require the removal of the 
current 15-year delimiting date within Chapter 33 benefits. Such an 
arbitrary cap on the opportunity to use this earned benefit serves only 
as a hindrance to the success of veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;In addition to the removal of the 15-year limit, it is imperative 
that the GI Bill no longer be considered through the strict lens of 
wartime eras. Indeed, tying education benefits to wartime eras led to 
each previous iteration of the benefit being cut. As a component of 
service, there should be one bill that serves all current and future 
veterans, and therefore should be updated in name to reflect this 
timeless concept, as ``The Veterans Education Assistance Act'' or 
referred to simply as the GI Bill. This simplified naming convention 
may seem minor, but it's importance is far-reaching as the re-naming of 
the benefit indicates its importance to all generations of veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 112. Monthly stipend for certain members of the reserve 
components of the Armed Forces receiving Post -9/11 Educational 
Assistance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would pro-rate the housing allowance to reflect 
periods when the service member is not on active duty and allow them to 
fully partake in their earned housing allowance under their GI Bill 
benefits. While many National Guard and Reserve members continue to 
serve while attending an IHL, many lose eligibility for GI Bill housing 
allowances when ordered to duty under title 10, United States Code. 
Caught between active duty, though receiving an insufficient housing 
allowance from the active duty service, and coupled with the inability 
to receive GI Bill housing payments, the veteran is punished for their 
continued service. This technical change would address this oversight.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 113. Improvement of information technology of the Veterans' 
Benefits Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would direct the VA Secretary to make improvements to 
the information technology system of the Veterans Benefits 
Administration (VBA) of VA. The directs that to the maximum extent 
possible, VBA should access information technology (IT) funding to 
address critical IT infrastructure updates. Presently VA's Office of IT 
(OIT) functions as a collective funding source for the total VA; simply 
put, individual departments have no dedicated resources for IT needs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The result of VA's current IT resourcing model structure is that 
OIT must constantly determine the highest priority needs of the VA as a 
whole, leaving some departments with a low level of resources for 
sustained periods of time. The dedication of these resources will allow 
the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) with the opportunity to 
receive necessary support in IT upgrade which directly the ability of 
VA to effectively process payments of benefits to student veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 114. Department of Veterans Affairs high technology pilot 
program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section proposes to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
to carry out a high technology education pilot program. The proposal 
would operate as a five-year pilot program, funded for up to $15 
million annually. SVA views this as complimentary to existing education 
programs, and addresses the need to develop innovative programs 
targeted at non-traditional students. The split payment requirement 
incentivizes providers to deliver high quality programs with high-
impact and successful student outcomes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;With an increase in innovation in higher education with companies 
like Dog Tag Bakery at Georgetown University, the education industry is 
beginning to recognize the need to adapt to more flexible or hybrid 
models for new generations of students. It is unclear if the contracts 
under this proposal reset annually, or how those funds are to be 
dispersed, however SVA is confident that such logistical details would 
be minor hurdles when compared to the overall benefit of this concept.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The industry desire for such a program is clear, including support 
from the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), the global 
voice of the tech sector. \7\ Over 60 members of ITI include technology 
giants such as Google, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Adobe, Microsoft, 
IBM, Intel and many others. \8\ Like VA's Accelerated Learning Program 
(ALP), SVA is eager to learn about the outcomes of this proposal.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 201. Work-study allowance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would amend title 38, United States Code, to extend 
the authority to provide work-study allowance for certain activities by 
individuals receiving educational assistance by the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs. The VA Work-Study Program is widely accepted as a 
highly beneficial system that provides student veterans the opportunity 
to earn additional income while attending an IHL, and simultaneously 
support the broader mission of VA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The Post-9/11 GI Bill is the most comprehensive and generous 
education benefit ever offered, though it often does not cover the 
total costs student veterans' experience. As the quintessential non-
traditional students, student veterans are often more mature by age and 
experience, 52% have families, and 18% are single parents. Roughly half 
of student veterans work full-time while attending an IHL, and another 
25% work part-time. With nearly 780,000 student veterans working while 
attending an IHL, it is clear that the demand for this opportunity is 
high.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 202. Duration of educational assistance under Survivors' and 
Dependents' Educational Assistance Program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section modifies the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational 
Assistance (DEA) Program from 45 months of educational benefits to 36 
months. The benefits of survivors and dependents would be comparable to 
those of the servicemembers. The DEA hasn't been updated to reflect the 
rising costs of college in many years, and unfairly offers survivors a 
lower rate. The compression of months is more reflective of the typical 
time to completion rate. Also, the change will afford an increase in 
the current payment rates, while maintain a budget-neutral, or cost 
reduction benefit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 203. Olin E. Teague increase in amounts of educational 
assistance payable under Survivors' and Dependents' Educational 
Assistance Program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would increase the amounts of educational assistance 
payable under DEA. In conjunction with section 202, this will provide 
survivors with an increased benefit, which is desperately needed due to 
the outdated payment rates. Unfortunately, many survivors are 
ineligible for the Fry Scholarship because the service member died 
prior to September 11, 2001, or were separated with a medical discharge 
and passed away as a retiree. It is our unwavering position that family 
members of the fallen utilizing these benefits earned with the ultimate 
sacrifice should be viewed as equal to veterans themselves for the 
purposes of education benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 301. State approving agency funding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section proposes an increase in resources provided to State 
Approving Agencies (SAA), the primary oversight and approval entities 
that determine program eligibility for GI Bill benefits. SVA believes 
that SAAs are a critical component to ensuring quality education, 
preventing fraud and abuse, and looking out for student veterans who 
may be subject to bad practices at various IHLs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;SAAs are effectively the gatekeepers of the GI Bill. Yet, the 
amount of resources provided to them has not kept pace with inflation 
and rising costs. We continue to urge congress to increase support for 
SAAs, and are pleased to see the inclusion of this legislation. The 
amount of resources spent on oversight should reflect the importance of 
resources spent in educational benefits; as such SVA supports the 
recommendations of the National Association of State Approving Agencies 
(NASAA) to increase funding from $19 million to $26 million.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 302. Authorization for use of Post-9/11 Educational Assistance 
to pursue independent study programs at certain educational 
institutions that are not institutions of higher learning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section permits veterans to use Post-9/11 Educational 
Assistance for an accredited independent study program (including open 
circuit television) at an educational institution that is an area 
career and technical education IHL or a postsecondary vocational IHL 
providing postsecondary level education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 303. Provision of information on priority enrollment for 
veterans in certain courses of education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section proposes that, pursuant to subsection (b)(5) of Title 
38 section 3698, the Secretary of VA will seek to collect information 
on whether or not IHLs operate priority enrollment programs. In 
discussions with dozens of higher education organizations, it is 
abundantly clear that there is a lack of information regarding the 
existence or application of priority enrollment programs as it pertains 
to student veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;The majority of student veterans are non-traditional students, and 
many have spouses, children, and careers. It is true that they do not 
have the luxury of waiting a year or a few semesters to take a required 
course when their livelihood is in the balance. SVA believes collection 
of this information over time will provide a strong basis for 
understanding the need and potential solutions to applying this 
concept, as well as the proper level that such programs should be 
applied.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 304. Limitation on use of reporting fees payable to 
educational institutions and sponsors of programs of apprenticeship.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section proposes increasing reporting fees as high as $16 per 
number of eligible veterans to execute or offset services required to 
process benefits. It also requires them to use the money for veterans. 
SVA believes the reporting fees to be critical components of offsetting 
the cost of administering GI Bill education benefits at the institution 
level; we also support requiring this reporting fee be accounted for 
appropriately as well as being expended on activities related to the 
execution of veteran benefit processing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Some concern has been expressed that IHLs with very few veterans 
would be caused undue strain in establishing a separate account for 
such a low number of students. As such, SVA supports setting a 
threshold to require IHLs with significant populations to adhere to 
this requirement, to avoid IHLs with only several student veterans from 
experiencing undue accounting strain as result of this provision.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 305. Training for school certifying officials.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section codifies the requirements for school certifying 
officials (SCO) training. SVA supports this provision, as the training 
provided through VA is critical for SCO's to maintain a high level of 
professional aptitude. In some cases, IHLs have not allowed SCOs to 
attend training, alleging that it was not required. This requirement 
removes any doubt about the importance of that training.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 306. Extension of authority for Advisory Committee on 
Education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section extends the authority of the VA Advisory Committee on 
Education (VACOE), an advisory body of subject matter experts that 
provide the Secretary of VA input on veteran issues in higher 
education. Previously, SVA provided input at through this forum to 
highlight necessary reform changes and statute which legally required 
VA to establish an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Upon recommendation to the Secretary of VA at the 2015 VACOE 
meeting, the agreement with FTC was reached. This is an example of the 
significant value and detailed level of policy analysis that the VACOE 
can provide to the Secretary. Additionally, SVA recommends the 
inclusion of a current student veteran to incorporate the perspective 
of those directly impacted by these policies, and looks forward to 
working with VA on implementing this recommendation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 307. Department of Veterans Affairs provision of on-campus 
educational and vocational counseling for veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to 
provide educational and vocational counseling for veterans on campuses 
of institutions of higher learning, and codify the program. SVA has 
been a long-time supporter of the VetSuccess on Campus (VSOC) program, 
which entails the campus having a VSOC Counselor, an expert full-time 
VA detailee, right on campus. We frequently hear student veterans 
identify the VSOC program as a top benefit that they find to be most 
valuable for their higher education experience.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;In providing feedback to SVA regarding the VSOC program, one 
student veteran shared, ``We have a VSOC Counselor from VA come to the 
IHL twice a month so Vets can start a new claim or ask questions 
concerning a claim. This helps immensely as the VA hospital is a 35-
minute drive from IHL and keeps our Vets on campus. Vets can ask our 
counselor any type of question concerning their benefits. They are also 
a Vocational Rehabilitation (VocRehab) counselor for a few of the Vets 
on campus. We are incredibly lucky to have this program on campus.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;In addition to appreciating the on-site access to a qualified VA 
counselor, many alluded to a direct personal impact on their academic 
performance. Another student veteran shared, ``The VSOC has been there 
to help me through the transition from soldier to student. Counseling, 
advising, financial help, even tutoring has been afforded to me through 
the VSOC. The VA representative has gone above and beyond to help me 
succeed, especially when IHL and life became overwhelming for me.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;These comments are indicative of the general feedback we received 
from members over the past several months in our field research on the 
program. In addition to the general support provided by VSOC 
counselors, student veterans noted the ability of counselors to quickly 
correct and process certifications as a major benefit to their campus. 
They often appreciated the connection counselors make with IHL 
administration as well. We believe the VSOC program is highly 
beneficial to student veterans and would like to see it expanded as 
resources allow.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 308. Provision of information regarding veteran entitlement to 
educational assistance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section proposes allowing IHLs to view the total and remaining 
amount of educational benefits of a veteran thereby allowing the IHL to 
properly counsel those veterans on their financial obligation and IHL 
requirements. This is a simple change with a significant impact, 
enabling greater communication between the IHL and the veteran.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;SVA is pleased to see the inclusion of an opt-out option for 
students who do not wish their IHL to have access to this information. 
In some cases, the potential for low-quality schools to use this 
information to the advantage of the school instead of the student is of 
concern. The opt-out option allows the student to manage this risk by 
providing them a mechanism to prevent their school from accessing the 
information regarding their GI Bill benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 309. Treatment, for purposes of educational assistance 
administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, of educational 
courses that begin seven or fewer days after the first day of an 
academic term.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section would allow IHL SCO and regional processing officers 
(RPO) the ability to define a ``calendar week'' for the purpose of 
education benefits as ``the seven-day period beginning on the first day 
of the institution's published academic calendar''. At present, VA 
defines a calendar week as being from Sunday to Sunday, while policy 
guidance for SCOs necessitates that those officials process terms 
depending on the first date the class meets for that period of the 
week. This minor technical discrepancy has led to some confusion in 
processing benefits, as well as duplicative efforts. SVA supports this 
change to reflect the reality of processing these benefits consistent 
with our interpretation of the congressional intent of the benefit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 401. Eligibility of reserve component members for Post 9/11 
Educational Assistance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sec. 402. Time limitation for training and rehabilitation for 
veterans with service-connected disabilities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Sections 401 and 402 recognize the service of National Guard and 
Reserve Members and ensures that an order to serve on active duty under 
sections 12304a and 12304b of title 10, United States Code, is treated 
the same as other orders to serve on active duty for the purposes of 
determining benefits eligibility of service members and veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Many of these service members perform the exact same duties as 
their active duty counterparts, yet they realize none of the benefits. 
Fixing this discrepancy is a top priority for SVA, as well as nearly 40 
other military, veteran, and higher education organizations that 
identified this issue with unanimous consent as being an imperative 
change. \9\

such as the deployment of an array of Marine Corps Reserve units as 
part of the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) in 
2016 experienced this issue first-hand. In the case of the SPMAGTF, 
nearly 300 Marine Corps Reservists were inaccurately advised from 
senior leadership that they would receive GI Bill Benefits, among other 
entitlements, for their active duty service.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;Those Marines and Sailors spent nearly six months serving in 
austere conditions, including several weeks as the initial reaction 
force in Haiti immediately following Hurricane Matthew \10\. While 
these servicemembers served side by side with their active duty 
counterparts, the Marine Reservists learned toward the end of the 
deployment that due to their activation code (12304b), they would not 
be eligible for GI Bill benefits.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;This section proposes aligning the basic allowance for housing 
under the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with the cost of adequate 
housing as determined by the Secretary of Defense. SVA supports this 
provision as it is grounded in common sense, while affording the 
opportunity to address the many issues presented within the previous 
sections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;We thank the Chairman, Ranking Member, and the Committee members 
for your time, attention, and devotion to the cause of veterans in 
higher education. We also want to recognize the dedication of the 
Chairman's staff, especially Jon Clark, Kelsey Baron, Caroline Ponseti, 
and Tiffany Haverly, who have dedicated countless hours to refining 
these provisions in close coordination with their colleagues in the 
Senate. As always, we welcome your feedback and questions, and we look 
forward to continuing to work with this committee, the House Veterans' 
Affairs Committee, and the entire congress to ensure the success of all 
generations of veterans through education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Walz"&gt;&amp;lt;F-dash&amp;gt;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
