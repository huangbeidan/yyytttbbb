                              ----------                              
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m., in 
room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Doug Lamborn 
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Lamborn, LaMalfa, Graves, Hice, 
Johnson; Huffman, Barragan, Bordallo, and Sablan.
    Also present: Representatives Crawford and Westerman.
    Mr. Lamborn. The Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans 
will come to order. The Water, Power and Oceans Subcommittee 
meets today to hear testimony on an oversight hearing entitled, 
``Federal Impediments to Commerce and Innovative Injurious 
Species Management.''
    Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at 
hearings are limited to the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, 
and the Vice Chair. I ask unanimous consent that all other 
Members' opening statements be made part of the hearing record 
if they are submitted to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5:00 p.m. 
today.
    Hearing no objection, so ordered.
    I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Arkansas, 
Mr. Westerman, and Mr. Crawford, also of Arkansas, be allowed 
to sit with the Subcommittee and participate in the hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    We will begin with opening statements, starting with myself 
for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO
    Mr. Lamborn. Today, the Subcommittee on Water, Power and 
Oceans will meet to discuss the implication of the Lacey Act on 
U.S. industry. While the Lacey Act is a relatively unknown law 
to the average American, this law, and specifically the 2008 
amendments, can have sweeping impacts to a myriad of domestic 
industries.
    This morning, we will hear from representatives from the 
aquaculture industry, as well as from a municipal water 
district on conflicts they have been subject to under the Lacey 
Act for conducting what most of us would think of as routine 
and mundane business activities.
    I think all of us here today are familiar with one of the 
more famous Lacey Act cases, Gibson Guitar, where according to 
Gibson's CEO, ``several dozen armed agents'' abruptly raided 
their Nashville facilities. While the presence of armed Federal 
agents raiding a manufacturing facility is unsettling enough, 
these agents further demanded that the security cameras in the 
factory be turned off during the inspection.
    None of us want to aid in the spread of invasive species, 
and that is not what today's hearing is about. However, it is 
the duty of Congress to inspect these laws and ensure that they 
are not unfairly treating our citizens. And, also, we need to 
examine ways that we may improve upon their implementation.
    While the tedious Federal legislative process can sometimes 
stifle creative approaches, states have stepped up and crafted 
innovative solutions to address the threat of invasive species 
in a constructive way that does not impede economic activity. 
We have seen significant strides made in the Great Lakes region 
by states coming together to combat Asian carp; we have seen 
legislative action just up the road in Virginia to remove 
impediments to possession, sales, and purchases of non-native 
species; and we have seen Florida use social and economic 
incentives to combat the spread of lionfish.
    The states are the ones that will directly reap the 
benefits or costs of invasive species management, so maybe it 
is time we allow them to take the wheel.
    Many of us throughout the West, as well as those of us 
bordering the Gulf of Mexico, have seen the benefits of 
allowing states to lead the way on species management. While 
that may not be a silver bullet to conflicts under the Lacey 
Act, I think it is worthy of discussion.
    I want to thank our witnesses for being with us here today. 
This is the first time this Committee has conducted oversight 
on the law since 2013. This hearing serves as a good 
opportunity to examine this law, and to discuss possible 
updates to ensure that it is working for our states, our 
environment, and our businesses.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Prepared Statement of the Hon. Doug Lamborn, Chairman, Subcommittee on 
                        Water, Power and Oceans
    Today, the Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans will meet to 
discuss the implication of the Lacey Act on U.S. industry. While the 
Lacey Act is a relatively unknown law to the average American, this 
law--and specifically the 2008 amendments--can have sweeping impacts to 
a myriad of domestic industries.
    This morning we will hear from representatives from the aquaculture 
industry as well as from a municipal water district on conflicts they 
have been subject to under the Lacey Act for conducting what most of us 
would think of as routine and mundane business activities.
    I think all of us here today are familiar with one of the more 
famous Lacey Act cases, Gibson Guitar, where, according to Gibson's 
CEO, ``several dozen armed agents,'' abruptly raided their Nashville 
facilities. While the presence of armed Federal agents raiding a 
manufacturing facility is unsettling enough, these agents further 
demanded that the security cameras in the factory be turned off during 
the inspection.
    Look, none of us want to aid in the spread of invasive species. 
That is not what today's hearing is about. However, it is the duty of 
Congress to inspect these laws and ensure that they are not unfairly 
treating our citizens and examine ways that we may improve upon their 
implementation.
    While the tedious Federal legislative process can sometimes stifle 
creative approaches, states have stepped up and crafted innovative 
solutions to address the threat of invasive species in a constructive 
way that doesn't impede economic activity. We have seen significant 
strides made in the Great Lakes region by states coming together to 
combat Asian carp, we have seen legislative action just up the road in 
Virginia to remove impediments to possession, sales and purchases of 
non-native species, and we have seen Florida use social and economic 
incentives to combat the spread of lionfish.
    The states are the ones that will directly reap the benefits or 
costs of invasive species management, so maybe it's time we allow them 
to take the wheel.
    Many of us throughout the West--and I can't forget the Gulf of 
Mexico--have seen the benefits of allowing states to lead the way on 
species management. While that may not be a silver bullet to conflicts 
under the Lacey Act, I think it is worthy of discussion.
    I want to thank our witnesses for being with us today. This is the 
first time this Committee has conducted oversight on the law since

                                 ______
    Mr. Lamborn. I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. 
Huffman, for 5 minutes for his statement.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
    Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning. 
Today's oversight hearing on the Lacey Act, in my view, should 
focus on strengthening America's premier wildlife protection 
statute to face the threats of the 21st century, such as 
wildlife trafficking and the spread of invasive species. But 
instead, we will be subjected, I fear, to misleading arguments 
claiming that people will be thrown into jail for minor, 
unintentional violations of the Lacey Act. So, I want to go 
ahead and debunk some of these myths.
    First, we might hear that aquaculture business owners are 
living in fear of criminal charges or 6-figure fines if they 
accidentally transport injurious species after they have taken 
all reasonable and prudent precautions. However, this 
protection against that kind of criminal penalty is already 
built into the law.
    If a person didn't know he was violating the law, he is not 
going to be subject to criminal penalties, period. Criminal 
penalties only apply to people who knowingly violate the law. 
If a person, in the exercise of due care, should have known 
that he was violating the law, then civil penalties may be 
appropriate. If there is no consequence, however, for failure 
to comply with the law, the incentives to exercise that due 
care will evaporate. And that is really what much of this 
conversation is all about.
    Why is this so important? This provision of the Lacey Act 
helps fight against the spread of invasive species, which costs 
the United States billions of dollars in damages every year. 
Any weakening of the Lacey Act that could allow invasives to 
spread more easily would have significant negative impacts on 
ecosystems and economies that depend on natural resources.
    I am aware that there are difficulties with interstate 
water transfers because of invasive species, and solutions are 
needed. But broadly allowing transfers across state lines is 
not sufficiently protective to limit the spread of invasive 
species, if there are no efforts to control or eradicate the 
species.
    Zebra mussels and quagga mussels are a good example. They 
are a highly damaging invasive species. They cause hundreds of 
millions of dollars annually in damages, they establish easily, 
and they are nearly impossible to eradicate once they are 
established.
    Another example is Asian carp, introduced through the 
aquaculture industry. They are a huge threat to native 
fisheries. The Army Corps of Engineers released a study finding 
that in order to keep Asian carp and other invasives out of the 
Great Lakes, it is going to require 25 years and billions of 
dollars.
    We should be encouraging people to be careful, not 
careless, with these natural resources that fuel our economy.
    Next, we are likely to hear that the 2008 amendments to 
address illegal logging in the Lacey Act have not done anything 
to curb international illegal logging. This is not true. In 
2015, a report from the Union of Concerned Scientists found 
that imports of illegal wood into the United States have 
declined by between 32 and 44 percent since those amendments 
took effect. It has helped level the playing field for American 
businesses that are playing by the rules.
    There are also claims about Gibson Guitar. The Chairman 
mentioned this in his opening remarks, and the claim that this 
represents over-criminalization under the Lacey Act. Before we 
put Gibson forward as a poster child for over-criminalization, 
let's remember that this is a company that admitted to 
knowingly importing illegal wood. So, they are not such a good 
poster child after all.
    And I sure wish this concern about over-criminalization 
applied to the cannabis issue. We have thousands of people in 
this country filling our prisons and jails for possession of a 
substance that is legal in a dozen states, and we all know will 
be legal in all 50 states, it is just a matter of time. But I 
suppose it takes a corporation facing criminal consequences to 
evoke sympathy and concerns of over-criminalization for some 
folks. But, again, not a good poster child.
    Mr. Chairman, I wish that we were having a hearing to 
discuss what we can do to stop the spread of invasive species, 
protect our natural resources, and combat the global criminal 
assault on wildlife and ecosystems. But instead, we have no 
choice but to remind folks in the context of this hearing how 
important the Lacey Act is. It is important for curbing the 
growing global illegal wildlife trafficking industry, it is 
important for stopping the spread of invasive species, it is 
critically important for holding criminal enterprises who flout 
Federal law accountable.
    In fact, if you want a good poster child for the Lacey Act 
you should look to Massachusetts and Carlos Rafael, the 
infamous Codfather, who misreported over 782,000 pounds of fish 
over the course of his career, he harmed lawful fishermen, he 
harmed struggling fish populations. And it was ultimately the 
Lacey Act that brought him to accountability under the law.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;     Prepared Statement of the Hon. Jared Huffman, Ranking Member, 
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Today's oversight hearing on the Lacey Act should focus on 
strengthening America's premier wildlife protection statute to face the 
threats of the 21st century, such as wildlife trafficking and the 
spread of invasive species, but instead, we will be subjected to 
misleading arguments claiming people will be thrown into jail for

necessary precautions.
    However, this protection is already built into the law. If a person

    This provision of the Lacey Act also helps to fight against the 
spread of invasive species, which cost the United States billions in 
damages every year. Any weakening of the Lacey Act that could allow 
them to spread more easily would have significant negative impacts on 
ecosystems and economies that depend on natural resources. I'm aware 
that there are difficulties with interstate water transfers because of 
invasive species, and solutions are needed, but broadly allowing 
transfers across state lines isn't sufficiently cautious to limit their 
spread if there are no efforts to control or eradicate the species. 
Invasive aquatic species like Zebra mussels and quagga mussels are 
highly damaging to aquatic ecosystems, cause hundreds of millions of 
dollars annually, establish easily, and are nearly impossible to 
eradicate.
    For example, Asian carp, which was introduced through the 
aquaculture industry, are a huge threat to native fisheries. The U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers released a study finding that in order to keep 
Asian carp and other invasive species out of the Great Lakes, it will 
require at least 25 years and billions of dollars. We should be 
encouraging people to be careful--not careless--with the natural 
resources that fuel our economy.
    Next, we are going to hear that 2008 amendments to address illegal 
logging haven't done anything to curb international illegal logging. 
This couldn't be further from the truth. A 2015 report from the Union 
of Concerned Scientists found that imports of illegal wood into the 
United States have declined by between 32 and 44 percent since the 2008 
amendments to the Lacey Act took effect. This has helped level the 
playing field for American businesses that are playing by the rules.
    There are also claims that the Gibson Guitar case is an example of 
``over-criminalization'' of the Lacey Act. But Gibson Guitar admitted 
to knowingly importing illegal wood, and as I've already said, a person 
is guilty of a felony only if they knew they were dealing with an 
illegal product.
    The Lacey Act is a powerful enforcement tool to fight criminal 
activity. It should not be weakened. It helps combat the illegal 
harvest of wildlife and protects Americans from fraudulent labeling and 
black markets that drive prices down and cost law-abiding businesses 
millions each year.
    For example, Carlos Rafael, a cod fisherman from Massachusetts, 
flouted Federal law for decades by misreporting the amount of fish his 
boats caught, and then sold the fish for cash that he often smuggled to 
Portugal to evade Federal taxes. His crimes likely impacted already 
struggling fish populations, in turn harming other fishermen. The self-
proclaimed `Codfather' misreported more than 782,000 pounds of fish 
over the course of his career. After bragging to two undercover IRS 
agents posing as Russian mobsters, he inadvertently unraveled his reign 
over the region's fishing industry. Thanks to the Lacey Act, his 
disreputable acts were punishable by law. He pled guilty to 28 criminal 
counts, 23 of which were Lacey Act violations. The provisions of the 
Lacey Act had the strongest force to dethrone the infamous Codfather 
and alleviate the pain he caused to honest, hard-working commercial 
fishermen and the cod fishery itself.
    Last, the Lacey Act is a key weapon in the fight against widespread 
and highly profitable illegal wildlife trafficking. Wildlife 
trafficking is an estimated $23 billion-a-year industry, making it the 
fourth most lucrative illicit activity in the world after the drug 
trade, counterfeiting, and human trafficking. That money is bankrolling 
terrorists and other criminal groups around the globe, causing wildlife 
poaching to surge to unpreceded levels and threatening our national 
security.
    We should not be trying to muddy the waters by distorting the 
intent and effect of one of our strongest conservation laws. Rather, we 
should be holding a hearing to discuss what we can do to help stop the 
spread of invasive species, protect our natural resources, and combat 
the global criminal assault on wildlife and ecosystems.
                                 ______
    Mr. Huffman. With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you. We will now hear from our panel of 
witnesses. Each witness' written testimony will appear in full 
in the hearing record. So, I ask that witnesses keep their oral 
statements to 5 minutes, as outlined in our invitation to you, 
and under Committee Rule 4(a).
    I will also explain how the timing lights work. When you 
are recognized, press the talk button to activate your 
microphone. Once you begin your testimony, the Clerk will start 
the timer, and a green light will appear. After 4 minutes, a 
yellow light will appear. At that time, you should begin to 
conclude your statement. At 5 minutes, the red light will come 
on, and I would ask that you finish your statement at that 
time.
    Our first witness is Mr. Mike Freeze, Vice President of Keo 
Fish Farm from Keo, Arkansas; our second witness will be Mr. 
Alexander von Bismarck, Executive Director for the 
Environmental Investigation Agency from here in Washington, DC; 
and our third witness will be Mr. Mike Rickman, Deputy Director 
of Operations and Maintenance for the North Texas Municipal 
Water District from Wylie, Texas.
    Thank you all for traveling to be here with us today.
    We will now begin with opening statements from our panel, 
beginning with Mr. Freeze.
    You are now recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;                         KEO, ARKANSAS
    Mr. Freeze. I would like to thank Chairman Lamborn, and my 
own Congressman Rick Crawford and Bruce Westerman and the 
remaining members of the House Subcommittee on Water, Power and 
Oceans for allowing me to address you concerning Federal 
impediments to commerce and innovative injurious species.
    My name is Mike Freeze and I am a fish farmer. I sit or 
have sat on numerous aquaculture and government advisory 
boards. Since 1983, I have been the co-owner of Keo Fish Farm 
along with my business partner, Martha Melkovitz. Our farm has 
over 1,000 acres of ponds in which we produce hybrid striped 
bass and U.S. Fish and Wildlife-certified sterile triploid 
grass carp for live sales nationally and internationally.
    For aquaculture facilities that ship live product 
nationally, our Number one Federal regulatory issue and 
impediment to interstate commerce is the Lacey Act. Written in 
1900 and amended numerous times, including in the 2008 Farm 
Bill, the Lacey Act prohibits the international and interstate 
trafficking of illegally obtained wildlife and fish or parts as 
designated by Federal, state, tribal or foreign governments.
    When the Lacey Act was written, it was specifically 
designed to regulate only wild animals, and aquaculture was 
practically non-existent. The 1981 amendments to the Lacey Act 
included a provision that broadened its application to all wild 
animals, including those having been bred, hatched, or born in 
captivity. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife has used this broadened 
definition to regulate domestically produced aquaculture 
species, but not other domesticated species, such as turkeys, 
elk, deer, bison, or quail.
    Of particular concern to our industry is the Lacey Act 
elevates the violation of even misdemeanor state regulations to 
Federal felonies, simply because a $350 domesticated product 
has entered interstate commerce. Penalties for Lacey Act felony 
violations begin at $100,000 and mandatory incarceration. This 
scenario is analogous to a $50 speeding ticket being elevated 
to a $100,000 speeding ticket, simply because you are driving 
on an interstate highway instead of a state highway.
    In a report by the National Agricultural Law Center 
entitled, ``Aquaculture and the Lacey Act,'' author Elizabeth 
Rumley states, ``The Lacey Act should be amended to exempt 
domestically produced aquatic species,'' and I could not agree 
more. This report by Ms. Rumley has been provided for your 
examination.
    But today, I want to speak specifically about one of the 
aquaculture industry's most egregious concerns with the Lacey 
Act, and that is the prosecution of farmers for the accidental 
inclusion of unintended species in the interstate shipment of 
aquatic species produced in commercial aquaculture for human 
consumption or for recreational or ornamental purposes.
    Prior to 1981, the accidental violation of the Lacey Act 
could not be prosecuted, as the Lacey Act contained language 
stating that any person that willfully violated the law was 
subject to penalty. Unfortunately, the 1981 amendments changed 
this ``willfully'' requirement to a ``knowingly'' requirement. 
And though I am not an attorney, I have been advised that it is 
much easier to prove ``knowingly'' in a court of law than 
``willfully'' or ``purposely.''
    Keeping track of Federal, state, tribal, and foreign-
regulated animals and plants is extremely difficult for U.S. 
fish farmers. The laws are amended frequently, and the states, 
tribes, and foreign governments do so without national public 
notice.
    Hearing my testimony, you may think I would like to see the 
Lacey Act repealed. But I can assure you this is not the case. 
Besides being a fish farmer, I consider myself an 
environmentalist, and the Lacey Act is extremely important for 
the purposes that it was written for: to prevent the 
exploitation of our natural resources. If you examined my 
resume, you will see I have a Master's Degree in Fisheries and 
Wildlife Management, was a former employee of the Arkansas Game 
and Fish Commission, and was appointed by Governor Mike 
Huckabee to a 7-year term as an Arkansas Game and Fish 
Commissioner.
    It is just hard for me to understand why the Lacey Act is 
being used to regulate domestic livestock, fish born on a farm, 
raised on a farm, and slaughtered on a farm. Until farm-raised 
fish are actually stocked into state or Federal waters, why are 
they considered wild fish?
    Finally, I am not asking for a free pass on animals that 
are accidentally included in a shipment of an aquatic species 
produced in commercial aquaculture for human consumption or for 
use on recreational or ornamental purposes. State agencies have 
state regulations that farmers still must abide by, such as the 
Wisconsin DNR has a prohibition on mosquito fish, but these 
state regulations are normally misdemeanors, not felonies. 
Instead, we are asking for protection from Lacey Act felony 
prosecution for the accidental inclusion of an animal in a 
shipment of an aquatic species produced in commercial 
aquaculture.
    Congressman Crawford understands this problem, and has 
worked throughout multiple Congresses on the Aquaculture Risk 
Reduction Act, which provides an exemption to the Lacey Act for 
the aquaculture industry when animals are accidentally 
transported across state lines. Please consider legislation 
like the Aquaculture Risk Reduction Act when looking at ways to 
reduce the burdens of the Lacey Act. Thank you.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;         Prepared Statement of Mr. Thomas Michael (Mike) Freeze
                          Keo Fish Farms, Inc.
    I would like to thank Chairman Lamborn, my own Congressman Rick 
Crawford and the remaining members of the House Subcommittee on Water, 
Power and Oceans for allowing me to address you concerning Federal 
Impediments to Commerce and Innovative Injurious Species.
    My name is Mike Freeze and I am a fish farmer. I sit or have sat on 
numerous aquaculture and government advisory boards and since 1983 I 
have been the co-owner of Keo Fish Farm along with my business partner, 
Mrs. Martha Melkovitz. Our farm has over 1,000 acres of ponds in which 
we produce hybrid striped bass and USFWS' certified sterile triploid 
grass carp for live sales nationally and internationally.
    For aquaculture facilities that ship live product nationally, our 
Number one Federal regulatory issue and impediment to interstate

practically non-existent. The 1981 amendments to the Lacey Act included 
a provision that broadened its application to all ``wild'' animals, 
including those having been ``bred, hatched, or born in captivity'' (16 
U.S.C. 3371(a)). The USFWS has used this broadened definition to 
regulate domestically produced aquaculture species but not other 
domesticated species such as turkeys, elk, deer, bison or quail. USDA, 
however, has defined wild members of the plant kingdom and excluded 
common cultivars and food crops (except planted trees). Hence, today 
our domesticated fish are regulated as if they were taken from the 
wild.
    Of particular concern to our industry, is that the Lacey Act 
elevates the violation of even misdemeanor state regulations to Federal 
felonies simply because $350 of domesticated product has entered 
interstate commerce. Penalties for a Lacey Act felony violation begin 
at $100,000 ($200,000 for organizations) and mandatory incarceration. 
This scenario is analogous to a $50 speeding ticket being elevated to a 
$100,000 speeding ticket simply because you are driving on an 
interstate highway instead of a state highway. In a report by the 
National Agricultural Law Center entitled ``Aquaculture and the Lacey 
Act,'' author Elizabeth Rumley states: ``The Lacey Act should be 
amended to exempt domestically produced aquatic species'' and I could 
not agree more. This report by Ms. Rumley is provided for your

    But today I want to speak specifically about one of the aquaculture 
industry's most egregious concerns with the Lacey Act: the prosecution 
of farmers for the accidental inclusion of an unintended species in the 
interstate shipment of aquatic species produced in commercial 
aquaculture for human consumption or for recreational or ornamental 
purposes. Prior to 1969, any accidental violation of the Lacey Act 
could not be prosecuted as the Lacey Act contained language stating 
that any person that ``willfully'' violated the law was subject to 
penalty. Unfortunately, the 1969 amendments changed the ``willfully'' 
requirement to a ``knowingly'' requirement. Though I am not an 
attorney, I have been advised that it is much easier to prove 
``knowingly'' in a court of law than ``willfully''.
    Keeping track of Federal, state, tribal, and foreign regulated 
animals and plants is extremely difficult for U.S. fish farmers. These 
laws are amended frequently and the states, tribes and foreign 
governments do so without national public notice. For example, 
Wisconsin has prohibited the importation of mosquito fish (Gambusia 
sp.) into their state, even though this species cannot survive their 
harsh winters, and was previously allowed into their state for many 
years. While minnow farmers try very hard to exclude native mosquito 
fish from their production ponds, federally protected migratory birds 
sometimes contaminate their ponds by transferring eggs or fry into 
these ponds. Just a few mosquito fish accidentally included in a 
shipment of several thousand pounds of fathead minnows shipped to 
Wisconsin would be a Lacey Act violation because the underlying 
Wisconsin state regulation prohibiting mosquito fish was violated 
during interstate commerce.
    Hearing my testimony, you may think that I would like to see the 
Lacey Act repealed but I can assure you that is not the case. Besides 
being a fish farmer, I consider myself an environmentalist, and the 
Lacey Act is extremely important for the purpose that it was written

Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and was appointed by Governor Mike 
Huckabee to a 7-year term as an Arkansas Game and Fish Commissioner. It 
is just hard for me to understand why the Lacey Act is being used to 
regulate domestic livestock (fish) born on a farm, raised on a farm and 
slaughtered on a farm? Until farm raised fish are actually stocked into 
state or Federal waters, why are they considered ``wild fish''?
    Aquaculture is defined as the farming of aquatic organisms such as 
fish, crustaceans, mollusks and aquatic plants under controlled 
conditions with some form of intervention in the rearing process to 
enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from 
predators, etc. Or put in simplistic terms: aquaculture is underwater 
farming. Total U.S. aquaculture production is currently estimated by 
NOAA to exceed $1 billion, while the U.S. seafood trade deficit exceeds 
$10.4 billion annually. In Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi 
alone over 250,000 acres are devoted to commercial aquaculture 
production.
    Finally, I am not asking for a ``free pass'' on animals 
accidentally included in a shipment of an aquatic species produced in 
commercial aquaculture for human consumption or for use for 
recreational or ornamental purposes. State agencies have state 
regulations that farmers still must abide by, such as the Wisconsin DNR 
prohibition on mosquito fish, but the state regulations are normally 
misdemeanors, not felonies. Instead, we are asking for protection from 
Lacey Act felony prosecution for the accidental inclusion of an animal 
in a shipment of an aquatic species produced in commercial aquaculture 
for human consumption or for use in recreational or ornamental 
purposes. Protection, I might add, that we had until 1969.
    Congressman Crawford understands this problem and has worked 
throughout multiple Congresses on the Aquaculture Risk Reduction Act, 
which provides an exception to the Lacey Act for the aquaculture 
industry when animals are accidentally transported across state lines. 
Please consider legislation, like the Aquaculture Risk Reduction Act 
when looking at ways to reduce the burdens of the Lacey Act.

The following document was submitted as a supplement to Mr. Freeze's 
testimony. This document is part of the hearing record and are being 
retained in the Committee's official files:
    --``Aquaculture and the Lacey Act,'' an Agricultural Law Research 
            Project by Elizabeth R. Rumley, The National Agricultural 
            Law Center, March 2010.

Questions Submitted for the Record to Mike Freeze, Vice President, Keo 
                               Fish Farm
                    Questions Submitted by Rep. Hice
    Question 1. Does the Lacey act unreasonably expect an American 
citizen who is engaged in importing to know an extensive set of laws 
and regulations of a foreign nation?
    Answer. The Lacey Act requires a U.S. citizen engaged in the trade 
of fish or wildlife defined as ``any wild animal, whether alive or 
dead, including without limitation any wild mammal, bird, reptile, 
amphibian, fish, mollusk, crustacean, arthropod, coelenterate, or other 
invertebrate, whether or not bred, hatched, or born in captivity, and 
includes any part, product, egg, or offspring thereof'' (U.S.C. 16 
Sec. 3371(a)) to be familiar with any law, treaty or regulation of the 
United States, any Indian tribal law, or any foreign law (U.S.C. 16 
Sec. 3372(a)).
    This requirement is unreasonable given that U.S. states and 
territories are constantly amending their regulations. The National 
Aquaculture Association has recommended to the Federal Interagency 
Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force and to the FWS that a Federal 
agency should publicly post U.S. Federal and state laws to inform the 
public and importers as a preventative measure and service to benefit 
the United States. This recommendation was presented with the 
understanding that commercial import shipments are inspected but 
overnight courier services are not. As an example of the challenge 
associated with monitoring state laws, the National Aquaculture 
Association presented to the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force in 
November 2016 an analysis that importers or distributors of aquarium 
fish into the United States or across state lines must be familiar with 
the regulations of 50 states and Puerto Rico which collectively, but 
not uniformly, prohibited 2,256 species. There are not uniform 
regulations for each state, as each state recognizes different species 
as posing a risk to its unique aquatic environments.
    Question 2. What type of reforms do you suggest that would 
eliminate the risk of criminal liability or imprisonment for those not 
engaging in purposefully deceitful conduct?
    Answer.
    Domestically cultured aquatic species should be excluded--The 
intent of the Act was to support state wildlife and fishery 
regulations; however, with the growth of U.S. aquaculture and its 
recognition as an agricultural activity, there has not occurred 
revisions to the Act to exempt domestically produced aquatic species. 
As an example, within the Lacey Act wild members of the plant kingdom 
are regulated and common plant cultivars and food crops are excluded 
(except planted trees). Within the Lacey Act, ``fish and wildlife'' is 
defined as any wild animal including those bred, hatched or born in 
captivity. The Act should be amended to exempt domestically produced 
aquatic species while recognizing the Act continues to support state 
regulations that have an aquaculture focus.
    Extreme penalties should be reduced--A 1981 amendment to the Act 
established the punishments of 5-year imprisonment or $20,000 fine; 
however, as provided for in 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 3571(e) misdemeanor 
penalties can be 1 year in prison and/or $100,000 fine ($200,000 for a 
business) and felony penalties can be up to 5 years in prison and/or a 
$250,000 fine ($500,000 for businesses). The Act should be amended to 
exclude penalty provisions from the extreme penalties provided in 18 
U.S.C.A. Sec. 3571.
    Market value should be increased for farm-raised aquatic species--
Misdemeanor penalties are assessed when the market value is below $350. 
Felony penalties are assessed if market value is above $350. The $350 
value was included in the 1981 amendment to the Act and may only be 
sensible when applied to the wildlife trade. The market value is far 
too low when compared against the $50,000 value of a truck load of bait 
fish sold interstate. Unless aquaculture species are excluded from the 
Act, then the Act should be amended to raise the market value that 
triggers penalties for violations concerning domestically produced 
aquatic species.
    ``Willfully'' versus an all-encompassing ``knowingly''--As a result 
of the 1969 amendments to the Lacey Act, any person that ``willfully'' 
violated the law was subject to penalty. However, the 1981 amendments 
changed this, holding all those who ``knowingly'' import or 
``knowingly'' engage in certain conduct subject to felony penalties. 
The higher standard of willfulness required Federal prosecutors to 
prove that the defendant not only wanted to cause harm but that he also 
knew that harm was certain to occur as a result of his actions. 
However, ``knowingly'' only requires proof that a person is practically 
certain his conduct will lead to the violation. For example, a farmer 
could be found guilty under the ``knowingly'' standard if he knows that 
an injurious or listed species is present near the farm, but still 
sends out a shipment that happens to include a hitchhiking live animal. 
Even if the farmer is ignorant of and may not be able, for all 
practical purposes, to exclude the hitchhiker, he may still be 
convicted because of his knowledge of the nearby population. As a 
result, the Act should be amended back to the original mens rea \1\ 
requirement of ``willfully'' or to the more contemporary requirement of 
``purposely.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The Model Penal Code was written by the American Law Institute 
in 1962 to standardize the definition of crimes across all states. Many 
states have adopted parts of it, including the ``mens rea'' or mental 
state provisions. The Code has five mens rea categories. They have very 
specific legal definitions and are summarized here for clarity. The 
categories are:
      &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Purposely--the actor wants to cause the harm and he 
knows that the harm is virtually certain to occur as a result of his 
conduct.
      &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Knowingly--the actor is practically certain that his 
conduct will lead to the result.
      &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Recklessly--the actor is aware that the attendant 
circumstances exist, but nevertheless engages in the conduct that a 
``law abiding person'' would have refrained from.
      &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Negligently--the actor is unaware of the attendant 
circumstances and the consequences of his conduct, but a ``reasonable'' 
person would have been aware.
      &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Strict liability--the actor engaged in conduct where his 
mental state was irrelevant.
    The misdemeanor provision states that ``. . . any person who 
knowingly engages in conduct prohibited by any provision of this 
chapter . . . and in the exercise of due care should know that the fish 
or wildlife or plants were taken, possessed, transported, or sold in 
violation of . . .'' The ``knowingly'' standard, where a person is 
practically certain his conduct will lead to a harmful result, is 
modified to incorporate elements of negligence through the phrase, ``in 
the exercise of due care.'' Negligence is a very low standard to prove. 
As a result, the prosecutor would just have to prove that the producer 
knew he was shipping fish across state lines and didn't use due care in 
preventing injurious or listed species from hitchhiking in the load. 
The Act should be amended to remove the phrase ``in the exercise of due 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
care.''
    Fail to label a package is a crime--The Act states, ``It is 
unlawful for any person to import, export, or transport in interstate 
commerce any container or package . . . unless the container or package 
has been previously marked, labeled, or tagged in accordance with 
regulations issued pursuant . . .'' to the Act. This provision does not 
require any mens rea at all, and is thus a strict liability offense, 
where a person's mental state is irrelevant. Strict liability is very 
rarely a standard in criminal law, as legislatures prefer to only hold 
people responsible for actions they intentionally or negligently 
perform. Instead, ``the Act should be amended to read that ``It is 
unlawful for any person to knowingly import, export, or transport in 
interstate commerce . . .'' a package that is not labeled as required 
by regulations developed pursuant to the Act.
    Warrantless arrest and search-and-seizure--The 1988 amendments 
amended the enforcement powers section to allow arrest and search-and-
seizure without a warrant. This provision may make sense when an 
active, ongoing wildlife violation is suspected, but it is onerous to 
farmers that manage extensive and fixed operations growing aquatic 
species. The Act should be amended to exempt farmers and farms from 
warrantless arrest and search-and-seizure.
    State or foreign law violations versus Federal law violations--
Currently, a Federal agency can, unilaterally, take action under the 
Lacey Act when state or foreign wildlife laws are violated. The law 
should be amended to require the Federal agencies to recognize the 
primacy of the state or foreign country wildlife regulations and to 
complete a consistency determination prior to initiating legal action.
    States increasingly regulate non-native species--Aquaculturists can 
be placed in extreme jeopardy when state-listed native and non-native 
species might be accidentally moved or possessed due to species 
similarity of appearance and the open access by species to aquaculture 
facilities (e.g., pond and shellfish production systems). The Act 
should be amended to exempt domestic producers of aquatic species from 
prosecution related to the unintentional shipment of state-listed 
native or non-native species. As noted earlier, the 50 states and 
Puerto Rico collectively prohibit 2,256 aquarium species.
    Disease responsibilities reside in USDA-APHIS--The U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, is charged 
with regulating all livestock diseases, including aquatic animal 
species. The recent report by the Government Accountability Office, 
Live Animal Imports (2010), noted that the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service is expanding its mission to beyond a focus on 
agricultural animals (including aquaculture species) to address 
zoonotic and wildlife diseases. The Act should be amended to direct 
USDA-APHIS to assume responsibility for Lacey Act derived regulations 
relative to salmonid eggs, fry, fingerlings and live or dead whole 
fish.

    Question 3. I understand that a ``blanket declaration'' program was 
created to allow importers to make declarations on a month's worth of 
shipments, but that as of 2017 less than 100 participants were still in 
the program.
    a. Was this test program a success?
    b. Did it improved the ability to protect wildlife, fish, and 
plants?
    c. Did the test show an improvement or hindrance to trade?
    Answer. Neither I nor anyone in the aquaculture industry that I 
know are familiar with or have been informed by the FWS about a blanket 
declaration program. I wonder if such a program is available relative 
to authorities granted to inspect wildlife and wildlife product imports 
or exports under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna or Flora 
(CITES) or the Lacey Act. FWS inspectors must have Form 3-177 or any of 
the several Form 3-200 variants in-hand, when inspecting incoming or 
out-going shipments to confirm the contents match information provided 
by the importer or exporter. Please see https://www.fws.gov/Le/
declaration-form-3-177.html. Wildlife and wildlife products import/
exports are restricted to 18 ports of entry, ports where an importer/
exporter has submitted an application for entry/exit of a shipment, 
customs ports or special ports. Please see https://www.fws.gov/le/
ports-contact-information.html.
                  Question Submitted by Rep. Crawford
    Question 1. Aquaculture is often falsely credited for the 
introduction of invasive species. One often stated example is that 
Asian carp were introduced by U.S. aquaculture. Is this true?
    Answer. No. The four species of the taxonomic family Cyprinidae 
generally recognized as Asian carp (grass, black, silver and bighead) 
were imported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and farmers 
with assistance from the FWS, in the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s in response 
to the Clean Water Act's directive to utilize biological control 
methods as opposed to chemical control methods. Asian carp were seen as 
potential tools to mitigate the use of chemicals to control nuisance 
native or introduced aquatic plants (grass carp), increase the 
treatment capacity for municipal sewage treatment plants (silver and 
bighead carp), control nuisance freshwater snails that are vectors for 
fish parasites (black carp), and for consumption as a human food 
(primarily the bighead carp and grass carp). Numerous state and Federal 
agencies, such as the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the Illinois 
Natural History Survey, the EPA and many others funded and conducted 
this research. The initial escapes of the grass, silver and bighead 
carps occurred via these public agencies. The source(s) of the initial 
escape of black carp is unknown.

                                 ______
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you for your testimony.
    Mr. von Bismarck, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;       ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATION AGENCY, WASHINGTON, DC
    Mr. von Bismarck. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members 
of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me today. My name 
is Alexander von Bismarck. I have investigated and studied 
global crime and natural resources for over 20 years. As 
Executive Director of the Environmental Investigation Agency, I 
have conducted field investigations on every continent into 
criminal networks dealing in illegal wildlife and timber. I am 
also proud to have served as a U.S. Marine.
    I am grateful for the chance to correct some misperceptions 
about the Lacey Act and show how enforcement of it, in fact, 
has benefited law-abiding American businesses and helped curb 
environmental crime across the globe.
    The Lacey Act is one of our oldest and most effective 
wildlife conservation laws. It has been around for over 100 
years. We figured out back then that unless you tackle the 
trade and demand, you will lose the fight against poaching and 
the incursion of invasive species. In today's global economy, 
illegal poaching and logging are multi-billion-dollar crimes. 
Our investigations have found that they fund terrorism, fuel 
conflict, and undercut law-abiding U.S. companies. Without the 
Lacey Act, designed to keep illegal wildlife and plant products 
out of our markets, U.S. citizens and U.S. businesses are 
forced into supporting these crimes, and to being dependent on 
them.
    A recent prosecution involving flooring made in China from 
illegal Russian wood stolen from endangered Siberian tiger 
habitat illustrates this case. The importer, Lumber 
Liquidators, was making about $1 billion in revenue a year off 
a business model that was looking for the cheapest and often 
illegal raw material around the world. They were fined $13 
million and asked to revamp their sourcing. This and other 
cases today give family operated sawmills and foresters and 
other manufacturers in the United States a chance to compete in 
the global marketplace, going forward.
    I was undercover in Russia and China collecting evidence 
related to this case, and I can tell you that no American 
businessman or woman wants to be put in the position of having 
to do business with the mafia that is running the wood trade 
there. This case was possible because of an amendment in 2008 
that is an example of how the Lacey Act has been modernized and 
strengthened, and how U.S. industry has seen the benefits.
    The Lacey Act plant amendment was born out of strong 
evidence that illegal logging and associated trade had harmful 
impacts, not only on the world's forests, but also on the 
American timber industry. Illegal timber imports were costing 
American businesses over $1 billion annually. By ensuring that 
trees and other plants need to be legally sourced, the Lacey 
Act provides a level playing field, which is why so many 
American businesses have rallied behind it.
    Next week, the 2008 amendment will be 10 years old, and 
there is reason to celebrate. A 2015 study found that imports 
of illegal timber had decreased by over 40 percent since the 
amendment was passed. I have personally seen the impacts while 
undercover in factories and with traders around the world that 
companies are beginning to reward products that are made with 
legal material coming from the United States, increasingly.
    Critics of the Lacey Act have cited the example of Gibson 
Guitar alleging unfair government over-reach and citing 
infractions involving Indian rosewood. In fact, and I was 
personally undercover with the timber boss involved, the 
centerpiece of the case was that the company admitted knowingly 
importing illegal rare ebony wood from Madagascar national 
parks, and that it continued to do so, even as management knew 
of the relevant laws. An e-mail showed that the company chose--
chose--to knowingly import ebony stolen from national parks 
when its American competitor said no. The illegal wood was 
forfeited, and Gibson entered into an enforcement agreement 
that included a compliance plan.
    The only one arguing that that is over-reach or an unfair 
result are those uninformed of the facts of the case, or those 
benefiting directly from illegal wood trade.
    We believe that the introduction of this bill, H.R. 3041, 
is based on misperceptions regarding the Lacey Act that we wish 
to correct. In previous testimonies, the biggest concern stated 
by the National Aquaculture Association was ``that the Lacey 
Act elevates the violation of even misdemeanor state 
regulations to Federal felonies simply because $350 of 
domesticated product has entered interstate commerce,'' 
implying that accidental inclusion of certain species in 
aquaculture shipments would lead to hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in penalties.
    It is a relief to report to you that this simply is not 
true. Although illegal goods may be seized under the Lacey Act, 
criminal penalties are imposed only if a person knew, or in the 
exercise of due care should have known, that the goods that he 
or she traded were illegal.
    Our enforcement agencies are over-stretched and in urgent 
need of more tools, more resources to catch the big fish to 
protect American businesses and consumers. The last thing they 
need is exemptions thrown their way that will benefit foreign 
fish farmers who are skirting the rules.
    In conclusion, the proposed bill is not necessary because 
the protection it aims to provide is already included in the 
Lacey Act. With the Lacey Act, the United States has set an 
example to the rest of the world that criminal wildlife and 
timber trade is not acceptable. It is imperative that the 
spirit of this law be upheld and its effectiveness not be 
undermined. Thank you.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;   Prepared Statement of Alexander von Bismarck, Executive Director, 
                   Environmental Investigation Agency
                              introduction
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the Subcommittee on 
Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs, thank you for inviting 
me to appear before the Subcommittee today for the oversight hearing, 
``Federal Impediments to Commerce and Innovative Injurious Species 
Management.''
    I have investigated and studied global crime in natural resources 
for over 15 years. As an investigator and the Executive Director of the 
Environmental Investigation Agency, I have conducted international 
field investigations on every continent into criminal networks dealing 
in illegal wood, endangered species and harmful chemicals. Before 
joining EIA, I researched linkages between economics, ecology and human 
health with the Harvard School of Public Health and the New England 
Aquarium. I have a master of science from the London School of 
Economics in Environment and Development and a BSc from Harvard 
University in Environmental Science and Public Policy. I am also proud 
to have served as a U.S. Marine.
    The Environmental Investigation Agency, Inc. (EIA), a non-profit 
501(c)(3) organization, has worked for nearly 30 years to investigate 
and expose environmental crimes, and advocate for creative and 
effective solutions. EIA's analyses of the trade in illegal timber, 
wildlife, and ozone-depleting substances have been globally recognized. 
As an example, our investigative work in the late 1980s provided 
evidence that led to the international ban on ivory trade.
    In my testimony, I will correct some misperceptions about the Lacey 
Act and its implementation, and show how enforcement of the Lacey Act 
has benefited American businesses and helped curb environmental crime 
across the globe, in particular illegal logging.
                      international wildlife trade
    The Lacey Act is one of our oldest and most effective wildlife 
conservation laws, it has been around for over 100 years. I think we 
all agree that the effective implementation of this law is having a 
positive impact in the United States and indeed around the globe. 
Numerous criminal trade networks have been stopped and once threatened 
species are on the road to recovery since the Lacey Act was signed into 
law.
    Illegal poaching and logging of natural resources is a billion-
dollar crime, and our investigations have found evidence that it funds 
terrorism, fuels conflict and undercuts law-abiding U.S. companies. 
Without the Lacey Act, which is designed to keep illegal wildlife and 
plant products out of our markets, U.S. citizens would unwittingly be 
supporting these crimes.
    John Cruden, former Assistant Attorney General of the Department of 
Justice's Environment and Natural Resources Division, dubbed the Lacey 
Act ``the single most important Federal wildlife protection law.'' \1\ 
Indeed, the Lacey Act is a fundamental tool for the U.S. Government's 
efforts to combat illegal trafficking of wildlife products such as 
elephant ivory and rhino horn. In the 2008 case United States v. Tania 
Siyam, the accused pleaded guilty to Lacey Act violations for illegally 
selling and importing raw ivory from Cameroon into the United States, 
and was subsequently sentenced to 5 years in prison and fined $100,000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.justice.gov/usao/page/file/439556/download.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Lacey Act is an essential legal component of Operation Crash, 
an ongoing multi-year investigation into rhino horn and ivory smuggling 
led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice 
that has resulted in more than 30 convictions, over $2.1 million in 
fines, and approximately $8 million paid in forfeitures and 
restitutions. Among those successfully convicted of Lacey Act 
violations as a result of Operation Crash was Zhifei Lei, a rhino horn 
trafficking syndicate leader who smuggled 30 rhino horns along with 
elephant ivory objects together worth over $4.5 million from the United 
States to China. In 2014 Lei was sentenced to 70 months in prison and 
forfeited $3.5 million in proceeds from his criminal activities.
    As one of the world's largest markets for illegal wildlife 
products, the United States sees more than just ivory and rhino horn 
smuggled across its borders. The Lacey Act has been used to prosecute 
companies and individuals illegally trading in protected species of 
coral, sharks, sea horses, rattlesnakes, leopards, and a multitude of 
other native and exotic wildlife species.
    The Lacey Act not only protects endangered wildlife and vital 
natural resources from destructive exploitation, it also protects law-
abiding American businesses from having to compete with criminals. For 
instance, in 2012 three men were arrested for running an aquaculture 
company in Florida that knowingly mislabeled wild-caught turtles as 
captive bred for international sale. Without the Lacey Act, prosecutors 
would not have been able to bring criminal charges against the 
traffickers.\2\

                            illegal logging
    Times have changed in the more than 100 years since the Lacey Act 
first became law, and Congress has kept apace, through thoughtful 
amendments, to meet the challenges increasingly sophisticated 
international criminal networks pose to legal trade. Most importantly, 
past amendments and phase-ins have strengthened the law and its 
implementation over time, while carefully avoiding the creation of 
dangerous loopholes that would incentivize more illegal trade.
    The 2008 plants amendment provides an excellent example of how the 
Lacey Act has been modernized and strengthened, and how U.S. industry 
and manufacturing sectors have seen the benefits of it. The Lacey Act 
Plant Amendment was born out of strong evidence that illegal logging 
and associated trade had harmful impacts not only on the world's 
forests, but also on the American timber industry. A 2004 study by 
Seneca Creek Associates concluded that illegal timber imports were 
costing American businesses over $1 billion annually.\3\ The 2008 
amendment ensures that trees and other plants need to be legally 
sourced, protecting American producers from having to compete with 
cheap illegal timber imports. The Lacey Act provides everyone a level 
playing field. That's why so many American businesses have rallied 
behind this law, and are in fact demanding even stronger enforcement 
today, rather than the creation of loopholes that would water it down 
and increase the chances for illegal goods to enter our market.

    Next week, the 2008 amendment will be 10 years old, and there is 
reason to celebrate, as there is evidence today that the Lacey Act has 
indeed contributed to reducing illegal logging while strengthening our 
domestic industries. A 2015 study by the Union of Concerned Scientists 
found that imports of illegal timber had decreased by over 40 percent 
since the amendment was passed, and concluded that stronger enforcement 
could bring even more progress.\4\ A more recent study by Jeffrey 
Prestemon for the U.S. Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service in 2016 looking at 
timber imports from high risk regions found that implementation of the 
Lacey Act had reduced overall U.S. timber imports by 24 percent.\5\

                        facts on the gibson case
    Critics of the Lacey Act have cited the example of Gibson Guitar, 
alleging unfair government over-reach. In fact, the case is a prime 
example of how the Lacey Act should and does work. In the criminal 
enforcement agreement Gibson stated clearly that it ``accepts and 
acknowledges responsibility'' \6\ for knowingly and illegally importing 
rare ebony from Madagascar. The emphasis here is on ``knowingly.'' 
Gibson admitted that it continued to order Malagasy ebony despite the 
fact that one of its employees knew about the relevant laws and had 
informed the company's management. The wood was subsequently forfeited, 
Gibson paid respective fines and entered into and enforcement agreement 
that included a compliance plan, which served as a useful guidance for 
responsible American companies who wanted to ensure they are sourcing 
legal wood.

agrees-resolve-investigation-lacey-act-violations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The enforcement action also had a decisive impact on enforcement 
against illegal ebony in other important markets, and helped bring 
illegal chainsaws in one of the most threatened protected areas in 
Madagascar to a halt.
                           lumber liquidators
    In 2015, Lumber Liquidators pleaded guilty to importing solid oak 
flooring from Chinese manufacturers made from illegally harvested 
timber from the Russian Far East. The company admitted to both criminal 
felony and misdemeanor, and agreed to pay $13.2 million in forfeitures 
and fines. The plea agreement included a detailed compliance plan to 
ensure that all future imports would be legally sourced. Through its 
reckless business model, the company contributed to destroying valuable 
forests and harming people and wildlife in the Russian Far East, 
including the last remaining wild populations of the Siberian tiger. 
Enforcement in this case was an instrumental move to level the playing 
field and to protect honest American businesses from unfair competition 
through unacceptable practices.
                        facts on the mcnab case
    Another frequently cited example of how the Lacey Act allegedly 
punishes companies unjustly is the case United States v. McNab. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. In fact, law enforcement in this case 
put an end to a large scale, sophisticated international criminal 
scheme involving more than 40 shipments of illegal lobster tails from 
Honduras, comprising more than 1 million pounds of lobster at a retail 
value of over $17 million.\7\ Four defendants were found guilty of 
knowingly violating the law, including charges of: conspiracy, 
smuggling, money laundering, Lacey Act violations, and false 
labeling.\8\

    \8\ United States v. McNab, 331 F.3d 1228, 1234 n.10 (11th Cir. 
2003).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The notion that the perpetrators in this case were wrongfully 
sentenced due to a misinterpretation of a foreign law can only be 
viewed as either regrettably misinformed, or deliberately misconstruing 
the facts.
            other common misperceptions about the lacey act
    We believe that the introduction of H.R. 3041, the Aquaculture Risk 
Reduction Act, is based on misperceptions regarding the Lacey Act that 
we wish to correct.
    In previous testimonies in 2012 and 2014 supporting the Aquaculture 
Risk Reduction Act, it was stated the biggest concern by the President 
of the National Aquaculture Association was ``that the Lacey Act 
elevates the violation of even misdemeanor state regulations to Federal 
felonies simply because $350 of domesticated product has entered 
interstate commerce,'' implying that accidental inclusion of certain 
species in aquaculture shipments would then lead to hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in penalties and even ``mandatory incarceration.''
    We are pleased to clarify today that nothing could be further from 
the truth. We would like to further correct some of the mis-information 
that apparently has led to the belief this amendment would be 
necessary.
  1.  Although illegal goods may be seized and forfeited under the 
            Lacey Act, criminal penalties are imposed only if a person 
            knew or, in the exercise of due care should have known, 
            that the goods he or she traded were illegal. We understand 
            Congressman Crawford's point that someone shouldn't go to 
            jail under the Lacey Act for a simple accident. As a matter 
            of fact, that is already the law and has been for a very 
            long time. Someone who commits an ``accidental infraction'' 
            is not guilty of a crime under the Lacey Act. We therefore 
            need to correct the notion that state regulation 
            misdemeanors would be elevated to ``Federal felonies'' 
            through the Lacey Act.
  2.  Since fisheries were included in the Lacey Act, we have not been 
            made aware of a case where accidental inclusion of illegal 
            fish species would have resulted in prosecution, let alone 
            jail time under the Lacey Act. The reason for that is that 
            the Lacey Act already provides the necessary protections 
            against such accidental infractions that were committed in 
            the exercise of due care.
    We also wish to draw attention to the fact that U.S. Government 
agencies have for many years emphasized, that unwitting individuals who 
accidentally come in contact with small amounts of potentially illegal 
merchandise, are not the target of enforcement. Our enforcement 
agencies don't waste their energy and resources on the ``small fish.'' 
The intent is to shut down large illegal networks that are threatening 
our natural resources base and are harming our economy. As the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service clarified in 2011: ``Under the Lacey Act, we 
focus on law enforcement where it counts: Principally, on those who 
knowingly transact in larger volumes of illegal products.'' \9\

    In fact, our enforcement agencies are already over-stretched and in 
urgent need of more resources and staff to catch the ``big fish'', in 
order to protect American businesses and consumers.
                               conclusion
    In conclusion then, it appears that the proposed bill is not 
necessary because the protection it aims to provide is already included 
in the existing Lacey Act. In turn, however, an exemption such as 
proposed could do real harm by creating legal loopholes for illegal 
merchandise to enter the market. While providing no additional 
protection to law-abiding American enterprises, the only ones who would 
be benefiting from such an explicit exemption would be criminals who 
knowingly violate the law and can then use it to ``accidentally'' bring 
illegal merchandise into circulation.
    Creating an exemption here would also set a dangerous precedent by 
opening the door to potential other, future proposals, including 
exemptions regarding the international illegal trade. Why would an 
international supplier or trader not claim to be subject to the same 
exemptions that U.S. producers enjoy? Once applied to aquaculture, why 
not apply it to other wildlife and timber sectors? We at EIA have been 
investigating the illegal wildlife trade for decades, and we have seen 
firsthand how quickly criminal networks can adapt in order to exploit 
legal loopholes.
    Such explicit exemptions would only increase the risk and the 
demand for illegal aquatic species and incentivize questionable 
businesses to trade in illegal fish ``by accident.'' These exemptions 
would benefit those willing to trade in other illegal wildlife products 
as well. For example, the International Trade Center, a joint agency of 
the World Trade Organization and the United Nations, published a paper 
in 2012 on the trade in Southeast Asian python skins suggesting that 
smugglers knowingly mix illegal python skins into legal skins shipments 
to confuse customs officials.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    With the implementation of the Lacey Act and its evolution over 
time, the United States has set an example to the rest of the world 
that illegal wildlife and timber products are not acceptable. It is 
imperative that the spirit and rationale of this law be upheld and its 
effectiveness not be undermined.
    Allowing illegal goods to enter our market is bad for business, 
forces legitimate suppliers into unfair competition and may threaten 
long-term supply.
    We understand the concerns of the National Aquaculture Association. 
However, as we have shown today, and contrary to what its name 
proposes, the ``Aquaculture Risk Reduction Act'' threatens to increase 
the risk of illegal trade and may end up hurting the very law-abiding 
American fish farmers it aims to protect.
                                 ______
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    Mr. Rickman, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;MAINTENANCE, NORTH TEXAS MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT, WYLIE, TEXAS
    Mr. Rickman. Chairman Lamborn, Ranking Member, and members 
of the Subcommittee, my name is Mike Rickman. I am the Deputy 
Director of the North Texas Municipal Water District. My 
testimony is to update you on the experiences of my agency with 
the Lacey Act that we have been dealing with for about 10 
years.
    Congressman Gohmert's H.R. 1807 represents an important 
step in the process of allowing the Lacey Act and water supply 
to co-exist. I believe that the solution my agency was forced 
to implement to restore our water supply will not be possible 
with other looming cross-border water transfer issues.
    Most water supply agencies do not have surplus raw water 
sources permitted, constructed, or operational. You cannot get 
them permitted without having purpose and need, so you cannot 
have redundant supplies.
    I do not believe that it was the intention of Congress to 
use the Lacey Act to shut off public water supplies when it was 
involved in a cross-border transfer. Nor do I believe that it 
was Congress' intention to force citizens to pay hundreds of 
millions of dollars--potentially, even billions of dollars--to 
construct closed conveyance systems or treatment protocols 
that, despite the fact that the invasive mussels can travel in 
different pathways to spread, it goes beyond the public water 
transfers. I don't think it is good public policy to shut down 
cross-border transfers between states should an invasive 
species be listed.
    Look at the Sabine River Authority's water supply. There is 
a Sabine River Authority of Texas, a Sabine River Authority of 
Louisiana--coming out of the same river, but if it is across 
state lines coming out of the same body of water, it could 
still have an impact because of the Lacey Act. That just does 
not make good sense, when you are going to provide water for 
cooling large, petrochemical plants that are on the Gulf Coast. 
It would create economic chaos for the region.
    The Colorado River Aquaduct is another one that is 
responsible for providing millions of people with drinking 
water and irrigating a significant portion of our food supply. 
If quagga mussels that are already present in the waters are 
listed as an invasive, should the people of Southern California 
have to pay billions to create a closed conveyance system or 
treatment to manage the mussels, similar to what our agency had 
to do?
    Rather than building on and expanding the requirements that 
my agency was forced to implement, there is a better way, and 
it is already in place. I am referring to the Federal, state, 
and local cooperative efforts that have already been well 
established and growing every day that includes mandatory boat 
inspections and the decontamination of boats found to have 
invasive mussels attached to them.
    My own state's program is led by the Texas Department of 
Wildlife, Texas Parks and Wildlife, and it is funded by the 
state of Texas and numerous water supply agencies. We 
participate. This is the Protect the Lakes You Love program, 
and it is currently being operated at a number of Texas lakes 
and waterways, especially where invasives have been discovered. 
It combines public education with mandatory inspections, 
decontamination of boats, especially that move from body to 
body. It has not stopped invasives, but it has reduced the 
relentless march across the state.
    Another example is the Western States Governors' 
Conference, which is, most notably, with the Department of the 
Interior, to control invasive mussels out of both the Columbia 
River and its watershed. To date, those efforts have focused 
mainly on inspection and decontamination.
    The Lacey Act is not well suited to stop invasives in the 
millions or even billions that have been established in the 
water bodies in different ways. And unless boat traffic is 
minimized between the lakes, it is going to be very difficult 
to control the invasives in those situations. Most invasives 
that we have seen have been transferred by boat.
    It is not the kind of threat that is addressed by shutting 
down long-established public water supplies, but instead 
through cooperation among Federal, state, and local partners in 
establishing and operating inspection and decontamination 
programs. I am not stating a concept here, but instead I am 
referring to a current reality that is in operation in the 
state of Texas and throughout much of the rest of the country.
    Bringing the Lacey Act into the 21st century with regard to 
cross-border water transfers must blend a public necessity of 
water transfers with the strengthening of an invasive control 
program.
    I would just conclude by saying public water supply is 
something that is for the public health and safety. We are 
talking hospitals, we are talking what you consume, we are also 
talking firefighting. You cannot let that be challenged by and 
threatened by something that we cannot control. Thank you.
