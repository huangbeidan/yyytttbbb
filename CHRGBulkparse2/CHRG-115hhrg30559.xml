    &lt;option&gt;    REPRESENTATIVE FROM TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON ARMED 
                            SERVICES
    The Chairman. The committee will come to order. Today, the 
committee will hear testimony from the three service 
secretaries on the administration's fiscal year 2019 budget 
request as well as on their progress in implementing the 
acquisition reforms already passed into law.
    The two are closely tied because both branches of 
government have a responsibility to get more defense value for 
the taxpayers from the money that's spent, as well as a 
responsibility to get innovation into the hands of the 
warfighter faster. Acquisition reform has put more authority 
and more responsibility with the services. We have begun to 
reverse the decline in funding. Now DOD [Department of Defense] 
and the services have to deliver results.
    The budget agreement, which Congress must complete by 
passing the appropriations bill this week, begins to repair and 
rebuild the military. But our adversaries are not waiting 
around for us to catch up. We must reform as we rebuild. We 
must be prepared across the full spectrum of modern warfare, 
from nuclear deterrence to the kind of political and 
information campaigns we will discuss at greater length at our 
hearing tomorrow. And we must measure success by output and 
results rather than inputs and process.
    The budget agreement gives us an opportunity, but the 
legislative and executive must work together to make the most 
of it. Business as usual will not adequately defend the Nation 
in today's world. I know I speak for all my colleagues on this 
committee in saying that we stand ready to do our part to get 
us on the right track.
    I yield to the ranking member.
&lt;/option&gt;

&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;          RANKING MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES
    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that.
    And I appreciate all the secretaries being here and I agree 
completely with the chairman's opening remarks. I think he 
perfectly outlines the challenge. There is the tiny little 
hurdle of actually passing those appropriations bills which 
seems to always be like we are just around the corner from 
doing it. That has been going on now for 14 months and it is 
still going on even as we are 3 days away from when it has to 
be done.
    But let us assume for a moment we get that done and there 
is a reasonable amount of money available to the Pentagon for 
2018 and 2019. And this is an enormously important opportunity 
for two reasons, number one, because it is a--well, three 
actually. There is a lot of money there so we have to make sure 
that we spend it wisely, as the chairman said.
    Number two, we face an incredibly complex threat 
environment, so we are going to want to do like 5 million 
things at once and prioritizing is going to be enormously 
important. And, number three, that money is very quickly going 
to be gone because when you look at our fiscal situation as we 
push towards $22 trillion in debt, we have, I think, the guess 
is it is going to be about a $1 trillion deficit this year and, 
of course, the Budget Control Act does have two more years, 
2020 and 2021, to come back into place.
    You never know, but the odds are this is the largest the 
defense budget's going to be for probably about the next 
decade. So we have to make sure that we spend this money wisely 
and we also spend it in a way that does not lock us into sort 
of long-term obligations that can't be met given the fiscal 
restraints that are coming.
    But I think the most exciting and most promising aspect of 
this as I have met and worked with all three of you and also 
the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary and the 
Acquisitions Under Secretary. And I think we have a great team 
together that is really focused on efficiency and is really 
focused on getting the most out of the money we spend and 
trying to make the mother of all bureaucracies, which is the 
Pentagon, work. I just had a good conversation with Secretary 
Spencer about this. I think we are headed in the right 
direction.
    I will just close by saying as we head into the 2018 NDAA 
[National Defense Authorization Act], if there is anything that 
we can do or not do in the NDAA to help you with that 
acquisition reform process, please let us know, because I think 
that is what's going to be most important is to make sure that 
we spend the money as wisely as is humanly possible to meet all 
the challenges that we do face.
    With that, I yield back and look forward to the testimony.

    The Chairman. The committee is pleased to welcome the 
Honorable Mark Esper, Secretary of the Army; the Honorable 
Richard Spencer, Secretary of the Navy; the Honorable Heather 
Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force as witnesses today.
    Without objection, your full written statements will all be 
made part of the record. And we will be interested in hearing 
any oral comments you would like to make at this time.
    Secretary Esper, we will start with you.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Secretary Esper. Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, 
distinguished members of the committee, good morning and thank 
you for the opportunity to be with you today.
    Let me say upfront that the Army's readiness across its 
formations is improving, and if called upon today, I am 
confident we would prevail in any conflict. This is due in part 
to the increased funding Congress provided last year. For this, 
I would like to say thank you.
    The Army's mission to defend the Nation has not changed, 
but the strategic environment has. Following 17 years of 
sustained combat, we now face a future characterized by the 
reemergence of great power competition and the continued 
challenges posed by rogue states and non-state actors, making 
the world ever more complex and dangerous.
    To address these challenges, the Army is changing. We have 
a comprehensive plan to ensure our long-term dominance, but we 
must have predictable, adequate, sustained, and timely funding. 
Fiscal uncertainty has done a great deal to erode our readiness 
and hamper our ability to modernize.
    While the Army must be ready to deploy, fight, and win 
anytime, anywhere, against any adversary, the National Defense 
Strategy [NDS] has identified China and Russia as the principal 
competitors against which we must build sufficient capacity and 
capabilities. Both countries are taking a more aggressive role 
on the world stage and either possess or are building advanced 
capabilities that are specifically designed to reverse the 
tactical overmatch we have enjoyed for decades.
    In support of the NDS, the Army is increasing our lethality 
along three focused priorities: readiness, modernization, and 
reform. Readiness is the top priority because only a ready 
total Army--Regular Army, Guard, and Reserve--can deter 
conflict, defeat enemies, and enable the joint force to win 
decisively.
    We are refocusing training for our soldiers to be more 
lethal and more resilient on the high-intensity battlefield of 
the future. We are increasing home-station training, getting 
more repetitions for our formations at the company level and 
below. We are giving training time back to commanders by 
reducing certain self-imposed mandatory training requirements 
not tied to increased lethality and by eliminating excessive 
reporting.
    We have maximized the number of Combat Training Center 
rotations to 20 per year, 4 of which are dedicated to the 
Reserve Component. These rotations are focused on the high-end 
fight, replicating near-peer competitor capabilities including 
increased enemy lethality, degraded communications, persistent 
observation, and a contested environment.
    And while the quality, training, and the esprit of our 
soldiers are what make the U.S. Army the most ready and lethal 
ground combat force in history, our superiority is enabled by 
the best weapons and equipment we can provide.
    As such, my second priority is modernization for future 
readiness. To ensure our soldiers never enter a fair fight, the 
Army is now increasing its investment in modernizing the force. 
Our modernization strategy is focused on one goal, make 
soldiers and units far more lethal and effective than any other 
adversary.
    The establishment of the Army Futures Command this summer 
is the best example of our commitment to the future lethality 
of the force. Army Futures Command will address the key 
shortcomings of the current acquisition system, providing unity 
of command, effort, and purpose to the modernization process.
    The Army has also identified its top six modernization 
priorities for the coming years. Each of these priorities is 
detailed in my written statement and each is the purview of a 
newly established cross-functional team [CFT].
    The purpose of these CFTs is to determine the requirements 
of needed capabilities to ensure all stakeholders are at the 
table from day one and to focus Army resources on accelerated 
experimentation, prototyping, and fielding. In order to ensure 
battlefield success, our doctrine must be updated to reflect 
the threat environment we face and remain at pace with our 
other efforts to modernize our equipment.
    My third priority is reform, freeing up time, money, and 
manpower to enhance readiness, accelerate modernization, and 
ensure the efficient use of resources provided to us by the 
American people. Our reform efforts particularly within the 
acquisition system are long overdue. While Futures Command is 
probably the boldest reform we are pursuing, other reform 
initiatives owe much to the acquisition authorities delegated 
to the services in prior NDAAs.
    Within these authorities, we are reinvigorating the Army 
Requirements Oversight Council, moving major defense 
acquisition programs back to the service, and using other 
transaction authorities to accelerate fielding in limited 
situations.
    A ready and modernized Army is critical to defend the 
Nation, but we must not overlook what makes us remarkable. For 
this, I have outlined three enduring priorities: first, taking 
care of our soldiers, civilians, and their families; second, a 
service-wide commitment, recommitment to the Army's values, 
especially by leaders, to treat everyone with dignity and 
respect; and finally, strengthening our alliances and partners 
by building stronger ties to a number of initiatives. I look 
forward to discussing this with you as time permits.
    With that, let me thank you again for this committee's 
continued support of the Army and specifically the defense 
authorizations and funding increases requested in the fiscal 
year 2018 and 2019 budgets. I look forward to your questions 
and appreciate the opportunity to discuss these important 
matters with you today. Thank you.
&lt;/option&gt;

    The Chairman. Secretary Spencer.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Secretary Spencer. Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member 
Smith, distinguished members, I want to thank you for the 
opportunity to appear before you today and give you the posture 
of the Department of the Navy. It is an honor to sit here 
before you with my fellow service secretaries.
    On behalf of our services, the Navy and Marine Corps team, 
thank you for the effort put forth by Congress in reaching a 
bipartisan agreement and then support by the authorizing 
committees. Let me tell you on behalf of the Navy-Marine Corps 
team, we understand that this put people in the farthest edges 
of their comfort zone and we are wildly supportive of that and 
we thank you for your efforts.
    We look forward to getting those resources as soon as 
possible in order to enhance readiness and lethality in our 
department. These resources will be expended, in focused 
alignment with the National Defense Strategy, building our 
combat credible force.
    I echo what Secretary Esper just said about the need for a 
steady state of resourcing. Today, 94,000 sailors and Marines 
are forward-deployed and stationed using the global maritime 
commons as a medium for maneuver, ensuring the maritime lanes 
of commerce remain free and open, assuring access to overseas 
regions, defending key interests in those areas, protecting 
United States citizens abroad, preventing adversaries from 
leveraging the world's oceans against us, 24 hours a day, 365 
days a year.
    Our budget requests enhance readiness and continue 
increasing the capability and capacity of the Navy-Marine Corps 
team. As directed in the 2018 National Defense Strategy, our 
budget submission supports building a more lethal, resilient, 
and agile force able to deter and defeat aggression by peer 
competitors and other adversaries in all domains across the 
conflict spectrum.
    My priorities for the Department center on three 
categories: people, capabilities, and processes. The ability to 
accomplish our mission relies on people: 800,000 sailors, 
Marines, Active Duty, Reserve, our civilian teammates, and all 
their families. We are building a more lethal and resilient, 
agile, talented, and rapidly innovating workforce as we speak.
    The ability to accomplish our mission relies on having 
capabilities necessary to fight tonight, challenge the 
competitors, deter our rivals, and win. We are investing in the 
modernization of key capabilities and new technologies to 
attain that goal.
    Lastly, the ability to accomplish our mission relies on 
having efficient processes in place that will speed the value 
and the ability to support our warfighters in a more effective 
and efficient manner. We are creating a continuous improvement 
mindset in both our culture, management systems in order to 
deliver performance with affordability and speed.
    I deliver to you today a plan for the Department of the 
Navy with a sense of urgency. We cannot and will not allow our 
competitive advantage to erode. With your guidance, these 
planned investments will provide combat credible maritime 
forces for the future. We will ensure we are good stewards of 
providing these resources, drive efficiency across the 
Department to maximize every dollar, and invest smartly to 
leverage the return on our investments.
    I look forward to your questions.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;in the Appendix on page 72.]
    The Chairman. Secretary Wilson.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Secretary Wilson. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Smith, my 
statement is in the record and I would just like to highlight a 
couple of points that is really part of our budget. The first 
is that the Air Force budget for fiscal year 2019 aligns with 
the National Defense Strategy. It recognizes that we face a 
more competitive and dangerous international security 
environment than we have seen in decades. It also recognizes 
that great power competition has reemerged as the central 
challenge to U.S. security.
    In our budget there really are two bold moves and one 
continuing theme. The first bold move is the acceleration of 
defendable space. We need to be able to deter, defend, and 
prevail against anyone who seeks to deny our ability to freely 
operate in space.
    The President's budget reflects an 18 percent increase over 
the fiscal year defense plan for 2019, the 5-year defense plan, 
and that is on top of a 6 percent increase that we presented in 
the fiscal year 2018 defense plan. So accelerate defendable 
space.
    The second bold move in this budget is the shift to multi-
domain operations. And that is most visible in changing the way 
the Air Force plans to do command and control.
    There is one continuing effort in our budget, and that is 
to keep improving readiness to win any fight any time. That is 
what you expect of your Air Force and I look forward to your 
questions.
&lt;/option&gt;
