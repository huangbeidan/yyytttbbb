    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREGG HARPER, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The hearing will come to order.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Today, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations is 
holding a hearing entitled ``Examining the Olympic Community's 
Ability to Protect Athletes from Sexual Abuse.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;We are here because recent events have highlighted a very 
troubling and concerning pattern of sexual misconduct within 
the U.S. Olympic community. There's been a systemic failure in 
the system to protect athletes, including in how allegations of 
sexual misconduct have been handled--or should I say not 
handled--by the national governing bodies, the groups that run 
individual sports, and the U.S. Olympic Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And let me be clear: One case of sexual abuse is one case 
too many, and it will take a Herculean effort to regain the 
trust of prospective athletes, their families, and the American 
people. The USOC and NGBs play a role in keeping millions of 
American athletes safe from harm.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The vast majority of the athletes involved in NGBs will 
never compete in Olympics. They are on teams affiliated with an 
NGB or play at an NGB-sponsored event. This can include little 
league teams, local tennis tournaments, or gymnastics 
competitions. They are, in many instances, children, but they 
still fall within the parameters of organized sport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;So when we talk about athletes' safety, we aren't just 
talking about elite athletes representing their country at the 
highest level of their competition, we are also talking about 
our friends, our neighbors, and, yes, our children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;This is why athlete safety must be the top priority of the 
USOC and NGBs, and why they should have robust policies and 
procedures in place that reflect this priority.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;More importantly, these policies and procedures must be 
followed, otherwise they aren't worth the paper that they're 
written on, and the culture must be such that our athletes feel 
safe and protected.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Sadly, we've seen what can happen when athlete safety is 
not a priority. Too often it seems that the USOC and NGBs 
haven't acted until they are publicly pressured to do so. When 
you have survivors saying that they were asked to stay silent, 
felt that they weren't heard, and didn't feel safe, there's 
something horribly wrong with the system.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Sexual abuse is a problem that our society must confront. 
According to the CDC's statistics on sexual violence, one in 
three women and one in six men experience sexual violence 
involving physical contact during their lifetimes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;While such focus has been on USA Gymnastics team doctor 
Larry Nassar, gymnastics is not the only NGB that has had its 
challenges. Recent public reports also include the Lopez 
brothers in Taekwondo, Rick Butler in Volleyball, and the 
multiple accusations that have come from the swimming 
community, as well as reports in many other NGBs not before us 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Historically, each NGB and the USOC were responsible for 
directly handling any complaints, allegations, or reports of 
sexual abuse within their respective sport. However, policies, 
procedures, and bylaws weren't consistent across all NGBs, and 
it's unclear whether there was adequate oversight to ensure 
that the applicable policies and procedures were even followed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;There have been some recent changes to improve how 
allegations of sexual misconduct are handled in the Olympic 
community. The USOC has used working groups to make 
recommendations for promoting and protecting athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Through these working groups, new policies and procedures 
were developed and the U.S. Center for SafeSport was created by 
the USOC and launched in March of 2017. Now all NGBs and the 
USOC are required to report all complaints or allegations that 
involve sexual misconduct to the Center for investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Over the course of this investigation, the committee has 
spoken with many survivors, and their experiences have informed 
and shaped our work. These conversations and the many thousands 
of pages of documents provided to the committee by survivors 
and whistleblowers helped shed light on the pervasive problem 
of sexual abuse in organized sport and prompted the committee 
to request documents from all 48 national governing bodies and 
the USOC.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;We greatly appreciate all the assistance that the survivors 
have provided and our hearts do go out to them. Our job now is 
to do everything we can to protect our athletes, many of whom 
are children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;This hearing will serve as an opportunity to review whether 
the USOC and NGBs have adequate policies and procedures in 
place to protect athletes from sexual abuse. It is of the 
utmost importance to hold them accountable for their past 
failures and ensure that safety is their top priority going 
forward. It is time to change the culture, once and for all.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I'd like to welcome all of our witnesses, and I do thank 
you for being here today. And I know this isn't an easy topic, 
but it is one that we need to address to keep our Nation's 
athletes safe. And we do look forward to hearing your 
testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Gregg Harper&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Gregg Harper"&gt;I would also like to thank the ranking member of the 
subcommittee, Ms. DeGette, and other minority members and staff 
for their bipartisan hard work and assistance that we've seen 
during this investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Gregg Harper"&gt;Today, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations is 
holding a hearing entitled, ``Examining the Olympic Community's 
Ability to Protect Athletes from Sexual Abuse.'' We are here 
because recent events have highlighted a very troubling and 
concerning pattern of sexual misconduct within the U.S. Olympic 
Community. There have been breakdowns and failures in the 
system to protect athletes, including in how allegations of 
sexual misconduct have been handled by the National Governing 
Bodies-the groups that run individual sports-and the U.S. 
Olympic Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Gregg Harper"&gt;The USOC and NGBs play a role in keeping millions of 
American athletes safe from harm. The vast majority of the 
athletes involved in NGBs will never compete in the Olympics. 
They're on teams affiliated with an NGB, or play in NGB-
sponsored events. This can include little league teams, local 
tennis tournaments or gymnastics competitions. They are, in 
many instances, children. But they still fall within the 
parameters of ``organized sport.'' So when we talk about 
athlete safety, we aren't just talking about elite athletes 
representing their country at the highest levels of their 
competition. We are also talking about our friends, our 
neighbors, our kids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Gregg Harper"&gt;This is why athlete safety must be the top priority of the 
USOC and NGBs, and why they should have robust policies and 
procedures in place that reflect this priority. More 
importantly, these policies and procedures must be followed-
otherwise they aren't worth the paper they are written on-and 
the culture must be such that our athletes feel safe and 
protected. Sadly, we've seen what can happen when athlete 
safety is not a priority.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

According to the CDC's statistics on sexual violence, one in 
three women and one in six men experience sexual violence 
involving physical contact during their lifetimes. While much 
focus has been on USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, 
gymnastics is not the only NGB that has had its challenges.

these working groups, new policies and procedures were

created by the USOC and launched in March 2017. Now all NGBs 
and the USOC are required to report all complaints or 
allegations that involve sexual misconduct to the Center for 
investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

to review whether the USOC and NGBs have adequate policies and

athletes. It is of the utmost importance to hold them

their top priority going forward. It is time to change the

&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DEGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. DIANA DEGETTE"&gt; And I'll now recognize the ranking member of
the subcommittee, Ms. DeGette.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;There were warning signs about sexual misconduct in amateur 
sports for decades. And yet, the systems that were supposed to 
protect our athletes failed. That's why we're here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;As the chairman noted, these systems failed to stop Larry 
Nassar from harming more than 250 individuals. They failed to 
stop a taekwondo coach from abusing three athletes over 7 years 
for which he was later convicted of multiple felonies. And they 
failed to stop a swim coach from abusing more than a dozen 
athletes over 30 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;That coach was eventually sentenced to 40 years in prison, 
but even a lifetime in jail cannot erase the damage that he has 
done.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;These cases, unfortunately, are not anomalies. Far too many 
athletes, from far too many sports, have come forward stating 
that they had been traumatized by the very people they trusted 
to help them achieve their dreams.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Today we are here because we need to know that the Olympic 
sport community has learned from these survivors and is using 
that knowledge to develop and implement a new system run by the 
U.S. Center for SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;We need to be the convinced that this new Center has a 
robust system to investigate and stop bad actors so that 
situations like this never happen again. And we need to make 
sure that the Center has adequate funding going forward into 
the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I understand that the U.S. Olympic Committee and the 
national governing bodies are engaging in their own internal 
investigations into what went wrong. I hope everyone today is 
prepared to explain exactly what they're doing to investigate 
and learn from past failures so that they can build a system 
that works.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I also hope the Center for SafeSport, which is located 
right in the heart of my congressional district, can help us 
explain how the past failures inform its work. Because the 
Center doesn't just investigate misconduct allegations, 
although that's an important part of their job, it also has the 
extraordinarily important task of developing anti-abuse 
policies and providing education and outreach to promote safe 
environments for athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I hope the Center will be able to make real, verifiable 
progress in creating a national culture of safety in sport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;But I've got to say that I have concerns about whether 
SafeSport has sufficient resources and whether it truly has the 
independence it needs from the organizations it oversees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I spoke yesterday with SafeSport, and I want to make sure 
that we have formal outside assessments of SafeSport's needs 
and operations. And I want to make sure that the Olympic 
community and the sporting community also are committed to 
giving them the resources that they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;In case you didn't know this, the Olympic Committee is not 
operating on a shoestring. Its annual revenue is hundreds of 
millions of dollars. I hope we will hear today that if 
SafeSport needs more money, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the 
other governing bodies are prepared to increase substantially 
the support that they provide to this much-needed watchdog.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I also want to know how the Center for SafeSport and 
national governing bodies will ensure that the independent 
systems that they've designed is working as intended and its 
meeting its goals of protecting the people that it is supposed 
to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;For example, will there be ongoing and periodic performance 
audits to ensure that the complaints are properly investigated, 
the SafeSport's educational component is being implemented, and 
that its standards are being adopted by the many sports 
organizations under its jurisdiction?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Ongoing audits are going to be critical to evaluating this 
new system, and I want to know that this will happen and that 
we have appropriate resources to do that work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I also want to understand that the U.S. Olympic Committee 
is prepared to enforce consistent anti-abuse policies and 
procedures across all governing bodies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;For example, some governing bodies post public lists of 
banned athletes and coaches, while others do not. Some 
governing bodies require SafeSport training for all affiliated 
individuals, and others only require it for their members.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I know that various affiliates are concerned about this and 
are trying to develop consistent policies. This is going to be 
critical and the leadership of the U.S. Olympic Committee will 
be critical.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Look, we're not here today to tear down the sporting world. 
American performances at the Olympics are a source of national 
pride, and sports in general benefit children and adults at all 
levels. But it does no good for our athletes to stand on a 
podium if they've been harmed by the people and organizations 
that help get them there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I hope that we're on the road to real change. Today, I want 
to hear from every witness how we truly are and that the steps 
that we are taken to date are not just window dressing, because 
every athlete, no matter what sport they play, no matter what 
level they're playing it, deserves to complete in a heavy and a 
safe environment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Diana DeGette&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;We are here today because there have been warning signs 
about sexual misconduct in sports for decades. And yet, the 
systems that were supposed to protect athletes failed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;They failed to stop Larry Nassar from harming more than 250 
individuals. They failed to stop a taekwondo coach from abusing 
three athletes over 7 years, a crime for which he eventually 
was convicted of multiple felonies. And they failed to stop a 
swim coach from abusing more than a dozen athletes over 30

prison, but even a lifetime in jail would not erase the damage 
he has done.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;These cases are not anomalies. Far too many athletes from 
far too many sports have come forward stating that they have 
been harmed by the very people they trusted to help them 
achieve their dreams.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;Today, I need to know that the Olympic sport community has 
learned from these survivors, and is using this knowledge to 
design and implement the new system run by the U.S. Center for 
SafeSport. I need to be convinced that this new Center has a 
robust system to investigate and stop bad actors so that 
situations like these never happen again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;I understand that the U.S. Olympic Committee and the 
national governing bodies are engaging in their own internal

prepared to explain exactly what they are doing to investigate

    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;I also hope that the Center for SafeSport is prepared to 
explain how these past failures inform its work. This Center 
does not just investigate misconduct allegations. It also has 
the extraordinarily important tasks of developing anti-abuse 
policies and providing education and outreach to promote safe 
environments for athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;I hope that this Center will make real, verifiable progress 
in creating a culture of safety in sport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;But I must say that I still have considerable concerns 
about whether SafeSport has sufficient tools and resources and 
operates with enough independence from the organizations it 
oversees. I want to know that there are formal ongoing 
assessments of SafeSport's needs and operations to ensure that 
it can handle its workload effectively.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;The Olympic Committee is not operating on a shoestring. Its 
annual revenue is in the hundreds of millions. I hope we will 
hear today that if SafeSport needs more money, the U.S. Olympic 
Committee and governing bodies are prepared to increase 
substantially the support they provide to the Center.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;Similarly, I would like to know how the Center for 
SafeSport and national governing bodies will ensure that the 
independent system they have designed is working as intended 
and meeting the needs of those it is charged with protecting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;For example, will there be ongoing and periodic performance 
audits to ensure that complaints are properly investigated, 
that SafeSport's educational component is being implemented, 
and that its standards are being adopted by the many sports 
organizations under its jurisdiction? Ongoing audits are 
critical to evaluating this new system, and I want to know that 
they will happen and that there are appropriate resources 
already set aside to make them happen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;I also want to understand that the U.S. Olympic Committee 
is prepared to enforce consistent anti-abuse policies and 
procedures across all governing bodies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;For example, some governing bodies post public lists of 
banned athletes and coaches while others do not. Some governing 
bodies require SafeSport training for all affiliated 
individuals, and others only require it for members.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;There must be consistency in these policies, and the U.S. 
Olympic Committee must require the national governing bodies to 
adopt all changes needed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;Let me conclude by saying that we are not here today to 
tear down sport. American performances at the Olympics are a 
source of national pride, and sports benefit children and 
adults at all levels. But it does us no good for our athletes 
to stand on a podium if those same athletes have been harmed by 
the individuals and organizations that helped them get there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;I hope that we are on the road to real change. Today, I 
want every witness here to convince me that we are, and that 
the steps taken to date are not just ``window dressing.'' 
Because every athlete, no matter what sport they play or at 
what level, deserves to compete in a healthy and safe 
environment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;    Thank you, and I yield back.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Reports of sexual abuse in organized sports have been in

    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;The problem of sexual abuse in organized sports is bigger 
than Larry Nassar and it's bigger than any single organization. 
Today we'll hear from the national governing bodies of several 
sports, and each one has to address sexual abuse of their 
athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Unfortunately, we have seen that these cases are not rare. 
Too many athletes have come forward with accounts of abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;These athletes come from different sports, but often we 
hear the same themes when we listen to them. Frequently their 
abusers held positions of power, sometimes controlling whether 
an athlete could train or compete, and frequently their abusers 
had powerful friends in their respective organizations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And up until recently, each sports' governing body 
addressed sexual abuse allegations internally, and that system 
failed to protect athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;There was a great need for an independent organization, and 
last March the U.S. Center for SafeSport opened its doors with 
a mission to prevent abuse and foster a culture of safety in 
sports.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Now sport governing bodies can and must report allegations 
of sexual misconduct to the Center for SafeSport. And the 
Center continues to receive new cases, as well as cases from 
athletes who had reported sexual misconduct in the past.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;On top of that, it offers education and training for sports 
governing bodies and athletes, and already the organization has 
provided training to more than 300,000 and has received more 
than 500 reports.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And clearly all of this takes resources, and we need to 
make sure that the Center for SafeSport has the resources and 
personnel it needs to do its work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I also want to hear what the U.S. Olympic Committee is 
doing to support the Center for SafeSport. Special language in 
the Tax Code designates the U.S. Olympic Committee as a tax-
exempt, nonprofit organization, but few nonprofit organizations 
can report revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars as 
the U.S. Olympic Committee did in its most recent tax filing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;The U.S. Center for SafeSport gets its funding from diverse 
sources, including fundraising and government grants. It also 
gets a portion of its funding from the U.S. Olympic Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So I hope we'll hear today that the U.S. Olympic Committee 
and the sports governing bodies are prepared to provide 
consistent and continuing support to the Center for SafeSport. 
It is critical for the Center for SafeSport to have a permanent 
and dedicated source of funding, and these sports organizations 
should make sure that that happens.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I also hope we will hear that the U.S. Olympic Committee 
will use its position of leadership and authority to require 
sports governing bodies to adopt reforms as needed to reduce 
the risk of harm to athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;For example, questions such as, who is subject to 
background checks, how these checks are done, and whether lists 
of individuals banned from the sport are made public, are all 
important safety standards that should be applied consistently 
across all sports.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I also want to hear that the Center for SafeSport, the 
Olympic Committee, and all governing bodies are committed to 
completing ongoing formal assessments and evaluations to 
determine what is working and what needs additional improvement 
or additional resources.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Before we leave today, I want to hear from all of our 
witnesses about the reforms they've implemented to keep 
athletes safe. I want you to convince me that you're thoroughly 
examining how you failed athletes in the past and that those 
lessons are shaping the reforms you're putting in place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And I need to be convinced that you are building a system 
with the right people, structure, and resources to protect 
athletes under your leadership. I also want to hear that there 
will be zero tolerance for the kinds of abuses that brought us 
here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;With that, Mr. Chairman, unless someone wants my minute, I 
will yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;Today leaders of the Olympic community will tell us that 
they failed the people they were supposed to protect. We must 
examine those failures, and understand whether the 
organizations before us today have learned from them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;Reports of sexual abuse in organized sports have been in 
the press for decades--years before the world learned of Larry 
Nassar's horrific crimes. It is shameful that many 
organizations share the blame for failing these survivors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;The problem of sexual abuse in organized sports is bigger 
than Larry Nassar, and it is bigger than any single 
organization. Today we will hear from the National Governing 
Bodies of several sports. Each one has had to address sexual 
abuse of their athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;Unfortunately, we have seen that these cases are not rare. 
Too many athletes have come forward with accounts of abuse.

Last March, the U.S. Center for SafeSport opened its doors, 
with a mission to prevent abuse and foster a culture of safety 
in sports. Now sports governing bodies can--and must--report 
allegations of sexual misconduct to the Center for SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;The Center continues to receive new cases, as well as cases 
from athletes who had reported sexual misconduct in the past. 
On top of that, it offers education and training for sports 
governing bodies and athletes. Already, the organization has 
provided training to more than 300,000 people, and has received 
more than 500 reports.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;Clearly, all of this takes resources, and we need to make 
sure the Center for SafeSport has the resources and personnel 
it needs to do its work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;I also want to hear what the U.S. Olympic Committee is 
doing to support the Center for SafeSport. Special language in 
the Tax Code designates the U.S. Olympic Committee a tax-exempt 
nonprofit organization. But few nonprofit organizations can 
report revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars, as the 
U.S. Olympic Committee did in its most recent tax filing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREG WALDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GREG WALDEN"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the chairman of the full 
committee, Mr. Walden, for an opening.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for leading
this investigation and holding this very important hearing 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Every one of us in this room has an Olympic memory. For a 
select few, it is actually competing in the Olympic Games on 
behalf of our great country. For the vast majority of us, it is 
watching our athletes compete.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;The Olympics inspire, they unite us, as we cheer them on to 
victory with great pride. Our children watch the Olympics with 
their own dream that one day they, too, may compete at the most 
elite level and represent our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;But the system of organized sport headed by the United 
States Olympic Committee and 48 national governing bodies, or 
NGBs, is much bigger than the Olympics and includes millions of 
athletes who don't necessarily compete at the highest levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;The four NGBs before us today--Gymnastics, Taekwondo, 
Volleyball and Swimming--collectively represent some 979,000 
members. USA Swimming includes everyone from Michael Phelps--
who, by the way, testified before this committee last year--to 
children competing in a local recreational league.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And the same is true not for the three other NGBs at the 
table today, but for all the other NGBs in existence.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;In pursuit of their dreams, athletes of all levels have 
frequent contact with coaches and doctors and trainers and 
volunteers, who are given responsibility beyond simply enabling 
these young athletes to achieve excellence in their chosen 
sport. We entrust them with athletes' safety and their well-
being.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;These individuals often hold positions of great power and 
authority over the athletes. Not only can they control an 
athlete's training schedule or medical treatment, those very 
individuals often have a direct say in that athlete's career, 
such as deciding who competes in an upcoming event.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;As has become abundantly clear, too many authority figures 
have abused their power and influenced and harmed the very 
athletes that were trusted to them. Athletes have very little 
power, by comparison, and too many have been failed by the 
system that purports to protect them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Much attention has been paid to the case of Larry Nassar, 
in part because of the sickening number of athletes he abused. 
To date, hundreds of women and girls have come forward as 
victims of Nassar's abuse that spanned two decades.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;But the sad truth is, that abuse in the Olympic community 
extends well beyond Larry Nassar and USA Gymnastics. The U.S. 
Center for SafeSport, established in March of 2017, has already 
received 488 reports regarding sexual abuse involving 35 of the 
48 total NGBs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;The committee has spoken with numerous survivors in the 
course of this investigation. And we thank all of them for 
their assistance in this work, and we know that their stories 
are not easy to tell.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;There were far too many similarities in what we heard. 
Individuals in positions of power not only abused their trust, 
but physically abused their persons. And when survivors sought 
help, far too many felt the system protected not them, but 
their abusers. They felt silenced.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;In the eyes of many survivors, the culture of medals and 
money won out over athlete safety and protection.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Changes have been made in the Olympic community over the 
past decade, in particular within the last year, that show how 
things are moving in the right direction. However, many 
questions remain about whether the community has come far 
enough and moved fast enough. More must be done to ensure that 
athlete safety is the top priority of the USOC and the NGBs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Today this committee will examine how to protect young 
athletes now and in the future. Among our concerns are:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Whether the culture within the Olympic community fosters a 
safe environment for victims to come forward;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Whether the policies and procedures that have been put in 
place over the past several years are enforced in a way that 
promotes transparency and accountability;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Whether the Center for SafeSport is the most effective 
organization it can be;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And, whether the USOC has exercised its full authorities 
over the Olympic community when it comes to creating and 
enforcing policies that protect our athletes from sexual abuse 
and misconduct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So I look forward to hearing about what Congress can do 
further to improve and strengthen the system so we're actually 
protecting athletes at all levels, and all ages, in all sports.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Greg Walden&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Thank you for being here as part of this discussion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for leading this investigation and

Olympics with the dream that one day they will get to compete 
at the most elite level and represent our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;But the system of ``organized sport'' headed by the USOC 
and 48 National Governing Bodies, or NGBs, is much bigger than 
the Olympics, and includes millions of athletes who don't 
compete at the highest levels of organized sport. The four NGBs 
before us today--Gymnastics, Taekwondo, Volleyball, and 
Swimming--collectively represent nearly 979,000 members. USA 
Swimming includes everyone from Michael Phelps to children

purports to protect them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Much attention has been paid to the case of Larry Nassar,

Nassar. To date, hundreds of women and girls have come forward

these cases are handled is changing for the better. However, 
many questions remain about whether the community has come far

athlete safety is the top priority of the USOC and NGBs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Today this committee will examine the progress that has 
been made. Among our concerns are whether the culture within 
the Olympic community fosters a safe environment for victims to 
come forward; whether the policies and procedures that have 
been put in place over the past several years are enforced in a 
way that promotes transparency and accountability; whether the 
Center for SafeSport is the most effective organization it can 
be; and whether the USOC has exercised its full authorities 
over the Olympic community when it comes to creating and 
enforcing policies that protect our athletes from sexual abuse 
and misconduct. I also look forward to hearing about what the 
Congress can further do to help improve and strengthen the 
systems that protect athletes of all levels, and all ages.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;    I thank our witnesses for being here today, and being part 
of this important discussion. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;With that, I yield the balance of my time to
the gentlelady from Indiana, Mrs. Brooks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank 
you for holding this hearing today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Abuse of all kinds has come under close scrutiny across the 
country this past year. Sexual abuse in particular has shown 
itself to be far more pervasive and insidious that many would 
have imagined.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thanks to the diligent work of my hometown newspaper, the 
Indianapolis Star, we've learned about the revelations about 
Dr.Nassar and his systemic abuse of U.S. gymnasts, but also 
more about our Nation's Olympic athletes and what they've had 
to endure for so many years in their Olympic quest, and this is 
unacceptable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I'm proud that I led, along with a colleague, Lois 
Frankelfrom Florida. We saw the passage of the bill Protecting 
Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization 
Act of 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Our President signed into law in February of 2018 this 
bipartisan, game-changing bill that prioritizes the safety and 
well-being of our Nation's athletes, because we must ensure 
that our youth are safety when they go to the gym, when they 
take the ice, when they go out onto the field to practice their 
sport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Young athletes look to their coaches, their instructors, 
their trainers as role models. And our bill, now law, works to 
ensure that our athletic national governing bodies will support 
a culture within their organizations to foster safe and healthy 
relationships between coaches, instructors, trainers, and 
athletes, through their policies and procedures that will 
prevent, detect, and report allegations of abuse to law 
enforcement in an appropriate and timely manner.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And I'm proud that this was signed into law, because our 
past, our present, and our future athletes, who are dedicating 
their lives to perfect their sport, the dream of the Olympic 
stage, need to be protected. They need to be safe and free from 
sexual abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    And I thank you all for being here today. I look forward to 
your testimony.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I ask unanimous consent that the Members'
written opening statements be made part of the record. Without 
objection, they will be entered into the record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Additionally, I ask unanimous consent that Energy and 
Commerce members not on the Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations be permitted to participate in today's hearing. 
Without objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I would now like to introduce our witnesses for today's 
hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;First, we have Ms. Susanne Lyons, acting chief executive 
officer at the United States Olympic Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Next is Ms. Kerry Perry, president and chief executive 
officer at USA Gymnastics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mr. Tim Hinchey, president and chief executive officer at 
USA Swimming.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mr. Steve McNally, executive director at USA Taekwondo.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Then we have Mr. Jamie Davis, chief executive officer at 
USA Volleyball.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And finally, Ms. Shellie Pfohl, president and chief 
executive officer at the U.S. Center for SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;You're aware that the committee is holding an investigative 
hearing, and when doing so has had the practice of taking 
testimony under oath. Do you have any objection to testifying 
under oath?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Let the record reflect that all witnesses have responded 
``no.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The Chair then advises you that under the rules of the 
House and the rules of the committee, you're entitled to be 
accompanied by counsel. Do any of you desire to be accompanied 
by counsel during your testimony today?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Let the record reflect that all witnesses have responded 
no.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;In that case, if you would please rise. I ask you to raise 
your right hand, and I will swear you in.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Do you swear that the testimony you're about to give is the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you. You may be seated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;You're now under oath and subject to the penalties set 
forth in Title 18, Section 1001 of the United States Code.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;You may now give a 5-minute summary of your written 
statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And we will begin with you, Ms. Lyons. You have a light

    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="SUSANNE LYONS"&gt;     AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, U.S. CENTER FOR SAFESPORT
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Harper,
Ranking Member DeGette, and members of the subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Three months ago, I agreed to serve as the acting CEO of 
the U.S. Olympic Committee because I felt an obligation to help 
address the significant and important issues that bring us here 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Like you, I was deeply saddened and also angry to hear the 
statements of the girls and women who were the victims of Larry 
Nassar. I heard the powerful and compelling stories of victims 
and survivors, including those that had sought help from people 
in the Olympic community. They found the system unresponsive, 
needlessly complex, and fraught with risks to their Olympic 
dreams. This is appalling and unacceptable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;The Olympic community failed the people it was supposed to 
protect. And I would like to apologize once again to those 
individuals and to their families, some of whom I believe are 
with us today. I know we can do better, and we will do better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;When I accepted this role, I announced a series of 
initiatives to address issues of abuse and other structural 
weaknesses. We committed to providing funding for gymnastics 
and athletes from other sports affected by abuse. We committed 
to doubling our funding for the Center for SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We announced a governance review. And we committed to 
strengthen the voices of the athletes, both young and adult, in 
our community. And importantly, we reiterated our commitment to 
reform USA Gymnastics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Last year, we demanded the resignation of the USA 
Gymnastics CEO, and this year we required a complete turnover 
of the USA Gymnastics board, along with several additional 
reforms.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Mr. Chairman, we are already making progress, but we have a 
long way to go. I would like to update the subcommittee on our 
efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;First, we are redoubling our efforts with the Center for 
SafeSport. After only 1 year it is already clear that the 
Center is serving an essential role in protecting athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;The Center has experienced a significant increase in the 
number of reports of abuse. And although any report is 
disheartening, that's the reason we need the Center. It 
provides a safe and independent path for athletes to report 
these concerns.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We doubled our grant to the Center to $3.1 million this 
year to enable it to hire more investigators and to resolve 
cases more quickly. We are also working with the Center to 
identify potential improvements in their policies and 
procedures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Second, we are listening to and enhancing the voices of 
athletes in the community through athlete surveys and through a 
series of athlete working sessions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Third, we announced a governance review to inform our 
engagement with the national governing bodies and athletes and 
our oversight of the Olympic movement in the United States. We 
need to make sure that we are organized and empowered to take 
appropriate steps to protect athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Rebuilding gymnastics is the fourth category. We committed 
to a $1.3 million grant to the National Gymnastics Foundation 
entirely for athlete assistance programs, medical support, and 
counseling.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We are in nearly constant contact with CEO Kerry Perry, the 
Gymnastics interim board, and others at Gymnastics. Recently, 
we supported Gymnastics as they established that interim board, 
and we supported them as they made governance reforms to 
implement best practices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Even as we move ahead, a fifth category of effort will 
develop in the coming months when we receive the report of the 
independent investigation of Nassar's abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;The investigation covers both the Olympic Committee and USA 
Gymnastics, as well as any other relevant information on abuse 
that the investigation reveals. We will make that report public 
in its complete and unabridged form, and we will take whatever 
actions are appropriate based on the report's findings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We have made significant progress in strengthening 
protections for athletes over the last few years, but our 
collective efforts must not cease. We must support the victims 
and survivors and honor those who have stood up against abuse. 
We promise to lead the Olympic community to bring real and 
lasting change.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Ms. Lyons follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;

&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF KERRY PERRY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="KERRY PERRY"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize Ms. Perry for 5 minutes for 
the purposes of your opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Chairman Harper, Ranking Member DeGette, members
of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, thank you for 
inviting me to testify today at this very important hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;For more than 50 years, USA Gymnastics has served as the 
national governing body for the sport in the United States. We 
have many responsibilities to the gymnastics community. None 
are more important than the safety and well-being of our 
athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Like all of you, I was appalled and sickened by the 
despicable crimes of Larry Nassar. We must do better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;I came on board at USA Gymnastics in December from outside 
the sport and the Olympic movement. My singular goal and the 
reason I accepted this mission is to create a supportive and 
empowering culture that helps our athletes achieve their 
gymnastics dreams in an empowering culture.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;First, I want to apologize to all who were harmed by the 
horrific acts of Larry Nassar. I was in the courtroom to listen 
to the incredibly courageous women explain in vivid and painful 
detail the damage he did to their lives. Their voices will not 
be forgotten.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;I commit to you that I will keep their words and 
experiences at the core of every decision I make, every day, as 
the leader of this organization. Their stories have broken my 
heart, but they've also strengthened my resolve.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Let there be no mistake, those days are over. USA 
Gymnastics is on a new path, with new leadership and a 
commitment to ensure this never happens again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Since December 2017, we have embarked on a mission to 
implement a culture that puts athletes first. To that end, we 
are working hard to regain the trust and confidence of our 
athletes, their families, and all who are a part of our 
gymnastics community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;In the past 5 months, here are just a few of the bold 
decisions to put USA Gymnastics on a new course:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We closed the National Training Center at the Karolyi 
Ranch.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We made difficult personnel decisions to ensure that USA 
Gymnastics has a fresh start.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We fully support the U.S. Olympic Committee and 
congressional investigations that we hope will shed light on 
how Nassar was able to commit these horrific crimes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We fully support Federal legislation, now a law, that will 
help safeguard amateur athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We expanded our SafeSport department to include five new 
positions, four of which will live in the regions that they 
cover throughout the United States, to better support, train, 
educate, and serve our members.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We created an Athlete Task Force where our athletes will 
help shape our organization's future and its strategic and 
operating decisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We continue to implement the Deborah Daniels 
recommendations stemming from an independent evaluation of USA 
Gymnastics policies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We are strongly enforcing the USA Gymnastics SafeSport 
Policy that requires mandatory reporting to find specific types 
of misconduct, set standards for grooming behavior, and 
establish greater accountability.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We made reporting of abuse easier with a dedicated toll-
free number and online reporting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We are amending our bylaws to support the cultural 
commitment to athlete safety and to help enforce SafeSport 
policies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We are educating and training our staff, our board, and our 
members on the new SafeSport Policy. I am pleased to report 
that our staff and our board are 100 percent SafeSport 
compliant.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Beginning in 2018, all professional and club members must 
be SafeSport certified as a condition of membership.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;We are participating in mediation in order to resolve the 
athletes' claims fairly and expeditiously.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;And we created an Athlete Assistance Fund, in cooperation 
with the National Gymnastics Foundation, to provide survivors 
of abuse with the needed financial resources for counseling and 
medical services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;These necessary changes are not just amendments to our 
policies, they are part of a cultural shift that reflects our 
commitment to prioritize the safety of our athletes and 
members. We will hold our organization to the highest standards 
of care in order to become the standard bearer of change.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;I am testifying today on behalf of the new USA Gymnastics, 
because right now there's a parent driving their child to 
gymnastics class. I want that parent to know that we are doing 
everything we can every day to protect your child.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Athlete safety must be at the forefront of everything we 
do. We have taken decisive action to grow into a more athlete-
centered organization, committed to helping our athletes 
fulfill their dreams in a safe and supportive environment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Out of respect for those who have stood on the podium under 
the United States flag, and out of devotion to the aspiring 
young athletes who set foot in gyms every day, we must and we 
will emerge stronger and safer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY HINCHEY III&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="TIMOTHY HINCHEY III"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize Mr. Hinchey for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;Chairman Harper, Ranking Member DeGette, and
the members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity 
to testify today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;In 2010, USA Swimming faced its own reality that children 
and swimmers were being sexually abused in sport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;USA Swimming apologizes, acknowledges and deeply regrets 
the abuse suffered by children, athletes, and other 
participants in swimming programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;Participation in sport should offer physical, social, and 
emotional benefits, but for some it has resulted in abuse and 
trauma that will negatively impact the rest of their lives. 
That is inexcusable. And like those who sit before me today, I 
am deeply committed to providing a safe and healthy environment 
for children to grow, play, and compete.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;While recognizing that much work remains to be done, let me 
describe the steps USA Swimming has taken.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;In 2010, USA Swimming established a comprehensive abuse 
prevention and response program called SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;USA Swimming hired an athlete protection officer, the first 
position of its kind in the Olympic movement, and established a 
national SafeSport Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;Over the past 8 years, the SafeSport program has evolved. 
Over 90 individuals have been banned from membership for sexual 
misconduct, and it is published on USA Swimming's ban list.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;Criminal background checks have been enhanced. Currently, 
we conduct monthly recurring reports on our 50,000 nonathlete 
members, resulting in approximately 600,000 annual background 
checks of adults who have access to children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;We have over 80 individuals dedicated to championing 
SafeSport athletes and efforts at the local, regional, and 
national level.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;Educational initiatives have also increased. Over 10,000 
individuals have received SafeSport training in in-person 
workshops or conferences.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;Finally, a victims assistance fund called SwimAssist has 
been established.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;However, I regret we continue to receive reports of child 
sexual abuse in swimming. The organization can, should, and 
will do more, and I will lead that effort.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;I'm the father of six, three girls and three boys, ages 30 
to 11, and I'm a swimmer. Upon assuming the role of president 
of USA Swimming in July of 2017, I recognized SafeSport's 
significance to the organization. And the opportunity to work 
with the subcommittee in this investigation has only 
intensified my commitment to make protecting children and 
athletes USA Swimming's absolute top priority.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;To that end, we have a number of new initiatives under way 
and we are vetting even more. The SafeSport-recognized club 
program will enhance athlete protection efforts at all levels, 
especially the local level. The ``Training the Trainers'' 
program will increase the number of advocates spreading the 
SafeSport message throughout our organization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;I have and will continue to meet with and engage with 
survivors of abuse to ensure that we hear their voices and we 
learn from their experiences.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;In addition to its own efforts, USA Swimming will continue 
to be a responsible leader, steward, and member of the Olympic 
sport community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;USA Swimming embraces its obligations under the Protecting 
Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization 
Act and already has policies in place that require reporting, 
prohibit retaliation, and limit one-on-one interactions between 
adults and children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;Further, USA Swimming supports the U.S. Center for 
SafeSport and is fully committed to its success.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;While we cannot change the past, we will learn from it and 
we will do better. Our commitment to preventing child sexual 
abuse and providing a safe and healthy environment for our 
athletes is constant and long-lasting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF STEPHEN MCNALLY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="STEPHEN MCNALLY"&gt;    The Chair now recognizes Mr. McNally for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member DeGette, and
members of the subcommittee, for just under 8 months I have 
served as executive director of USA Taekwondo.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;I thank the committee for the opportunity to express my 
personal commitment, and the commitment of USA Taekwondo under 
my leadership, to ensuring that athletes are protected from 
sexual misconduct within the U.S. Olympic community, as well as 
all those participating in sports outside the Olympic movement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;For the purposes of background, USA Taekwondo was formed in 
2004 to assume responsibility as the national governing body 
for Taekwondo after the dissolution of the previous governing 
body, the United States Taekwondo Union.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;Very few records exist from the USTU era, and no continuity 
exists between USTU and USAT with regard to the organization's 
board of directors, leadership, or senior staff.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;From the information and documents that I have accumulated 
since becoming executive director in September of last year, I 
have concluded that the organization's response to complaints 
prior to 2015 varied as administrations, boards, and ethics 
committees changed personnel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;USA Taekwondo has always sought to balance its obligation 
to protect members from misconduct, while also abiding by the 
requirements to protecting the rights of the accused.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;In 2015, following allegations by an athlete of sexual 
assault at the hands of USAT coaches, USA Taekwondo immediately 
retained Denver attorney Donald Alperstein from a firm 
specializing in amateur sports law since 1985 to serve as an 
independent outside counsel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;From this point forward, USA Taekwondo has relied on its 
outside counsel to investigate all of USAT history in an effort 
to uncover any previously unreported incidents of sexual 
assault and misconduct, and to pursue sanctions against 
defendants.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;Outside counsel operated without any limitation on its 
budget, with no control by USA Taekwondo as to whom he should 
or should not pursue, and with only rudimentary intermittent 
reporting requirements to USA Taekwondo.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;At the direction of outside counsel, in conjunction with 
the support of USA Taekwondo leadership, a number of measures 
were implemented immediately following its engagement to 
address pending allegations of misconduct, discover additional 
claims, and execute remedies to ensure the safety and security 
of USA Taekwondo athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;The investigation was conducted by outside counsel hired at 
the direction it USA Taekwondo and succeeded in exposing 
evidence of misconduct within USA Taekwondo and USTU as early 
as 1994.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;However, as one might imagine, the pursuit of sanctions 
against defendants proved to be somewhat elusive, with many 
victims hesitant to reopen old wounds and reluctant to discuss 
matters about which their families, friends, or employers were 
unaware. Some victims could not be located, and some were 
unavailable for a variety of other reasons, including 
incarceration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;Several victims eventually disclosed information to outside 
counsel but only on the condition that they could do so 
confidentially and would not be compelled to testify without 
further discussion. And to this day, outside counsel has raised 
some concern over sharing information he received only through 
providing these promises.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;The committee has expressed an interest in Steven and Jean 
Lopez. To summarize, a lifetime ban has been imposed on Jean 
Lopez, and Steven Lopez is under a temporary suspension pending 
disposition of his case by SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;I do want to emphasize USA Taekwondo submitted evidence 
gathered concerning these allegations to the FBI, the 
Sugarland, Texas, Police Department, the Fort Bend County, 
Texas, Sheriff's Office, and the Colorado Springs Police 
Department.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;With the creation of SafeSport in March 2017, all cases 
still pending in outside counsel's investigation were 
transferred.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;Personally, it is my strong commitment to be part of the 
solution. And under my leadership, USA Taekwondo has already 
taken additional efforts to become more proactive in the area 
of athlete protection.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;These include the immediate referral of any and all sexual 
abuse allegations to SafeSport, and the referral of any 
allegations involving a potential crime to relevant law 
enforcement agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;We immediately suspend an individual upon receipt of a 
direct allegation if we believe there is a threat to athletes 
currently, or clear evidence of an allegation being true.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;We now ensure leadership on any official trip contains both 
genders. We require SafeSport training now for all referees. 
We've introduced mandatory background checks and SafeSport 
training for vendors even who are working at our events.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;And we have just engaged a group called Fighting Spirit, 
which provides education on sexual misconduct. All minor 
national teams athletes will be required to take this training 
in the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;Finally, next month USA Taekwondo will launch the 
#notinmysport education campaign, with the goal of informing 
participants throughout the sport as to what is acceptable 
behavior and what constitutes a violation, and also to empower 
our athletes to stand up and make their statement on social 
media channels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;There is no doubt more work to be done. The entire Olympic 
family must ensure that funding and resources remain available 
to SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

opportunity to speak with you today and to share with you USA 
Volleyball's commitment to the safety our athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;I joined USA Volleyball as its CEO in January of 2017, and 
in that timeframe I have been proud to lead an organization 
that respects all of our participants and places the highest 
value on personal safety before medal counts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;USA Volleyball actively encourages our members to report 
any and all incidents regarding sexual misconduct or abuse, and 
we provide them a safe environment to express their concerns. 
We report and investigate any allegation brought forward, and 
we have the obligation to take appropriate action, if 
necessary. This is the core of our values.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;USA Volleyball has long championed a culture of protection 
of all participants. We were one of the first NGBs to implement 
a robust background screening policy. Beginning in the 2004-
2005 volleyball season, USA Volleyball starting working with 
nationally respected background screening company SSCI and 
implemented a policy requiring individuals who participate with 
junior volleyball clubs to submit to a background screening.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Recognizing a need to do more to protect athletes of all 
ages, USA Volleyball formed a commission in 2010 to address 
participant safety, named the Special Commission on Athlete 
Safeguards. This commission set out to review the current 
trends and best practices in athlete safety and produce 
recommendations for USA Volleyball to implement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;The recommendations of the commission were extensive, but 
included: one, developing a procedure for reporting sexual 
harassment or abuse allegations;two, formulating written 
policies that define inappropriate behavior; and three, 
providing continual education on these kinds of topics to USA 
Volleyball participants and parents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;The commission's work paved the way for USA Volleyball to 
establish early SafeSport policies and procedures before it was 
even called SafeSport. We are proud to have been a very early 
endorser of a SafeSport program and supporter of the U.S. 
Center for SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;As I hope is evident, USA Volleyball has long considered 
the safety of our athletes to be a top priority. This priority 
was not suddenly created in response to recent headlines or as 
a result of mounting public scrutiny, but done so because many 
years ago we recognized protecting our athletes and members as 
the right thing to do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;I would like to address the case of Mr. Rick Butler, who 
has made headlines in the volleyball world. Mr. Butler is a 
well-known private volleyball club owner and coach in the 
Chicagoland suburb of Aurora, Illinois.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;His club, Sports Performance Volleyball, is not owned or 
operated by USA Volleyball; however, its athletes and coaches 
are required to be members of USA Volleyball if they wish to 
participate in USA Volleyball-sanctioned events.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;In 1995, allegations of sexual misconduct were brought 
forth by three women that took place while they were members 
and played at his privately owned club. The women claimed that 
Mr. Butler had a sexual relationship with them in the 1980s 
while he was their coach and while they were under the age of 
18.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;As a result of those allegations, in 1995 USA Volleyball 
found that Mr. Butler had violated our rules, and as a result, 
they voted to ban him for life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;After 5 years passed and upon Mr. Butler's request for 
reinstatement, USA Volleyball voted to conditionally reinstate 
Mr. Butler's membership in the year 2000 under the limitation 
of Mr. Butler's inability to ever coach junior girls in USA 
Volleyball-sanctioned events.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;To be clear, regardless of all the headlines surrounding 
this matter, and since the year 1995, Mr. Butler has been 
banned from coaching junior girls under USA Volleyball, a 
condition of his lifetime ban that never changed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Furthermore, these allegations are a result of Mr. Butler's 
activities as a club director and coach for his privately owned 
club and not a part of USA Volleyball national team programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;In late 2016, several brave women came forward to USA 
Volleyball to provide new allegations against Mr. Butler for 
sexual misconduct dating back to the 1980s. Based on these 
women's claims, USA Volleyball filed new charges against Mr. 
Butler. And in January of 2018, USA Volleyball's Ethics and 
Eligibility Committee held a hearing regarding these 
allegations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Mr. Butler was once again found to have violated our rules, 
and as a result, Mr. Butler was banned from total participation 
in USA Volleyball for life without the possibility of 
reinstatement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Our efforts were recently applauded by the CEO of Champion 
Women, Ms. Nancy Hogshead-Makar, one of the Nation's most vocal 
advocates for women's rights in sports. In her letter addressed 
to me on April 2, 2018, Ms. Hogshead-Makar wrote in part, 
quote:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;``We are reaching out today to thank you for banning Rick 
Butler from volleyball for his sexual predation of young girls. 
It took a lot to be the first organization to ban him, and we 
are grateful for your strong commitment to the victims and 
safety of all athletes. We are optimistic that these efforts 
will make a difference the next time any sports organization 
has to make a call to investigate, hold a hearing, or ban a 
member, if necessary,'' end quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;I do not pretend that we have been perfect, nor do I ignore 
the fact that there have been some offenders in our midst. I 
encourage anyone listening to me today that if you have 
information of any misconduct within our organization, past or 
present, please contact our offices or the U.S. Center for 
SafeSport. We will listen, and we will act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;We want to create the most safest, most enjoyable 
atmosphere for volleyball players of all ages and look forward 
to a day when there is no sexual abuse or misconduct in 
volleyball. We will do everything we can to make this a 
reality, and we look forward to working with others to do so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF SHELLIE PFOHL&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="SHELLIE PFOHL"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize Ms. Pfohl, the president and 
CEO of the U.S. Center for SafeSport.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Harper, Ranking Member
DeGette, and members of the committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;It is my privilege to serve as president and CEO of the 
United States Center for SafeSport, an independent, nonprofit 
organization in Denver, Colorado.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;The Center is dedicated to making athlete well-being a 
centerpiece of our Nation's sports culture. Let me say that 
again. Our Center is dedicated to making athlete well-being the 
centerpiece of our Nation's sports culture through abuse 
prevention, education, and accountability.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Far too many of our Nation's athletes have suffered abuse 
at the hands of perpetrators who take advantage of a sports 
environment where athletes form bonds with their coaches, 
trusted adults, and teammates. As you said, Mr. Chairman, if 
one athlete is abused, it's one too many.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;I know from experience that sport at its core builds 
character, promotes healthy lifestyles, and develops self-
confidence. We are here today because we never want to lose 
sight of those values.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Our March 3, 2017, we opened our doors as an independent 
entity and started taking reports on day one. Today our 
operations include a 9-member board and 14 full-time employees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thanks to the support from Congress and the leadership of 
Representative Brooks, we were recognized in the Protecting 
Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization 
Act, which became law in February.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Among the many safeguards it put in place, the law requires 
that anyone working in amateur sports must immediately report 
the suspected abuse of minors to law enforcement and prohibits 
retaliation against those who choose to come forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Adults who have regular contact with minors in Olympic and 
Paralympic sports must now complete mandatory SafeSport 
training, adhere to best practices, policies, and procedures, 
like the SafeSport code.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;The code specifically outlines and prohibits forms of abuse 
and misconduct and defines the processes surrounding reporting. 
Reports can be made through the Center's Web site or by calling 
our office.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;I want to stress that anyone who is listening, reports can 
be made anonymously and there is no statute of limitation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;The safety and well-being of those we serve is our 
priority. Our qualified investigators are trained to handle 
each report with care through the industry best practice of 
trauma-informed response.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Before I go into the numbers, I want to underscore that we 
never lose sight of the fact that behind these numbers are 
people, men, women, boys, and girls, dealing with the lingering 
effects of abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;In our first year, we responded to more than 500 reports 
and inquiries. This year, we expect that number to more than 
double.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Let me put it into perspective for you. This time last 
year, we were getting 20 to 30 reports per month. Now we're 
getting 20 to 30 reports per week.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;So far, we have issued 169 sanctions, including sanctioning 
142 individuals with permanent ineligibility. That's no small 
detail, 142 individuals are permanently unable to coach or 
participate in Olympic and Paralympic sports. These adults are 
listed in our online searchable database, which is available to 
anyone who wants to use it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;The volume of reports speaks to the critical need of the 
Center. We know how hard it is for victims to come forward. Our 
goal is to continue building trust while establishing a culture 
where everyone feels safe, supported, and empowered to report, 
with the ultimate objective to end all forms of abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;In addition to investigating reports, we also provide 
outreach, education, and training, not only for athletes and 
coaches, but for parents and youth sport organizations at all 
levels. In our first year, almost 400,000 people completed our 
online training and hundreds more have expressed interest in 
accessing it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;This past year was a step in the right direction, and I 
know we have a lot more work to do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;In closing, sport has the power to be an incredibly 
positive influence on participants, communities, and our 
Nation. I thank you for helping us to prioritize our important 
mission to champion respect and end abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Ms. Pfohl follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you, Ms. Pfohl.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The Chair will now begin the questioning by the Members. 
And we are going to ask unanimous consent that the contents of 
the document binder be introduced into the record and to 
authorize staff to make any appropriate redactions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

record with any redactions that staff determines are 
appropriate.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Ms. Lyons, if I may ask you some questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Does the USOC see itself as responsible for overseeing and 
enforcing policies that keep athletes safe?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes, I think that we do view ourselves as
responsible. And I think if we have had a failing, it is that 
we have not adequately exercised our authority in that manner.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; My question was, is that your responsibility?
And you've answered yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes, I believe it is.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Is it a top priority for the USOC?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; It is a top priority.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And I'm glad you said that and view it that
way, but we're all worried that it hasn't always been the case.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;If you could look at the document binder that's before you 
there and turn to Tab 1.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    In Tab 1 you're going to see a Washington Post article 
dated February the 23rd of 2018. Do you see that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes, I do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The article references a deposition in a 2016
lawsuit in which a Taekwondo athlete alleged that she was raped 
by her coach at the USOC's Olympic Training Center.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;USOC's lawyer, Gary Johansen, was asked whether protecting 
athletes from abuse was a top priority for the USOC. His 
response: ``The USOC does not have athletes.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Does the USOC believe that it has the authority to require 
NGBs to implement policies and procedures?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes, I believe the act does grant us that
authority. And I think a change we need to make is for us to 
exercise that authority more thoroughly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The USOC provides NGBs with governance support,
and in some instances the USOC has required changes to an NGB's 
bylaws related to the act or the USOC's bylaws. Is that 
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; However, each NGB has their own governance
structure and applicable bylaws and policies. Is that true?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes, that is true.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;As I mentioned in my opening statement, you can
have all of the policies and procedures in the world, but if 
they're not properly implemented, followed, or enforced, 
they're not doing much good.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The USOC engaged Baker Tilly to conduct audits of the USOC 
in all of the NGBs and high performance management 
organizations to assess their compliance with SafeSport 
policies and procedures. The audit reports for each 
organization were issued last year in October 2017. Some of the 
organizations were found to be in compliance with the SafeSport 
policies and procedures and didn't have any observations, but 
many were found to have deficiencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Do you know how many audits found deficiencies?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes. In fact at that time the majority had
deficiencies. However, I am pleased to say that virtually all 
are now in compliance.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Would it be fair to say that 43 NGBs had
deficiencies?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The audit of the USOC itself also found a
number of deficiencies for USOC. If you could turn to Tab 2 in 
your notebook there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;In Tab 2, you'll see that audit. And these included a lack 
of guidance and specific requirements on anonymous or 
confidential reporting by survivors, training, and background 
checks, to name a few.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Unlike the NGBs with deficiencies, however, there doesn't 
appear to have been a follow-up audit of the USOC. Do you plan 
to conduct a follow-up audit?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Let me just have a moment to review this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Yes, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes. Having looked at this, I think to any
extent where we have deficiencies it is required that we should 
do exactly the same thing that we expect of the NGBs, we should 
have a follow-up audit and ensure that we are, ourselves, in 
compliance.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; What ability does the USOC have to enforce
policies and procedures?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;I think the act grants us a great deal of
authority.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    I think one of the areas that we most need to look at--and 
this is why we have introduced a governance review--is that we 
have two main levers, we can take away funding or we can 
decertify. Our main activity is to decide if an NGB is 
certified.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; So you can decertify, you can put them on
probation or you can withhold funds.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; That is correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;So you have a number of tools at your disposal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    What circumstances would it take to warrant that the USOC 
take such action? What do you have to see? What would you have 
to see in behavior by an NGB to decertify or to withhold funds? 
What are you looking for?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We look for a number of things. They include the
ability to manage effectively; and administratively we look for 
them to have appropriate financial controls.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;And in the recent years we have also added a very 
incredibly important requirement that they meet all of the 
SafeSport standards, that they have just implemented all the 
new language that is in the new legislation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    So we have increasingly added to our list of compliance 
that they must have these SafeSport protections, and we audit 
against that on a regular basis now.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;My time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the ranking member of the 
subcommittee, Ms. DeGette, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I would like
to follow up on your questioning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, I think that you testified there's roughly 49 of 
these NGBs. And as we heard today, just from a representative 
sample, every group has their own governing principles. Is that 
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; That is correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And that's probably why it is really important
that we have an organization like the Center for SafeSport so 
they can have an overriding protocol for complaints of this 
nature. Isn't that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes, I totally agree.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And that's, in fact, one reason why the Center
for SafeSport was founded in March of 2017, just a little over 
a year ago. Is that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Now, I want to turn to you, Ms. Pfohl, because
you testified that last year the Center for SafeSport had about 
20 to 30 complaints per month. This year it is 20 to 30 per 
week. And you have got about 800 reports pending right now. Is 
that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; No, ma'am. Thank you for the question. We have
had over 800 total reports----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I see.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Ms. Pfohl [continuing]. To come in since we opened our 
doors.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; In the roughly 14 months, you have had 800
reports.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Correct, correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Now, in a May 17 submission to this committee
SafeSport reported that the U.S. Olympic Committee provided 
$2.7 million in 2017 and is going to provide roughly $3.1 
million for 2018 and $3.1 million for 2019, the same amount for 
2019. Is that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Yes, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Now, getting back to your testimony, I think
you had said, ever since the #MeToo movement--you told me this 
yesterday--ever since the #MeToo movement, the Center for 
SafeSport has seen the number of complaints skyrocket. Is that 
right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Definitely, between the #MeToo movement and the
Nassar trial.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And the Nassar trial.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; We really saw an uptick.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; It has really gone up this year. Is that
right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Uh-huh.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And that's probably a good thing, because
people realize they can report and what you're doing. Is that 
right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Yes, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; So you get money from the U.S. Olympic
Committee for your funding. You also get money from the 
different NGBs according to a schedule for how much they're 
giving. Is that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Yes. Each national governing body gives us an
annual fee based on their size.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Now, what is your budget right now?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Right now it is a little over $4.6 million.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And how many investigators do you have on
staff.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Internally we have five full-time investigators
plus three additional support staff. We have seven external 
contracted investigators, as well.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; So you have roughly 13.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Twelve or 13.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Twelve or 13 people. Do you believe that's
sufficient with the increase in complaints to thoroughly 
investigate every complaint?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; No.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Mr. Hinchey, I want to talk to you for a
minute, because I also spoke with you yesterday. Do you believe 
the Center for SafeSport has sufficient funding to be able to 
investigate all of these complaints that they're getting?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; I'm not familiar with their entire budget, but
I think based on our experience right now they can certainly 
use more resources.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Now, over at your organization you give
$50,000 a year to Center for SafeSport, is that right, as part 
of your----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; Just under that, about 43,000.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And you would be willing to give more. Is that
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; Absolutely. I think as one of the larger NGBs,
and based on who we are, if we can provide more resources we 
absolutely will.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Now, Ms. Lyons, the U.S. Olympic Committee,
according to the most recent tax filing, the organization's 
revenues are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Is that 
correct, Ms. Lyons?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And so I want to ask you, are you committed to
giving the full funding that SafeSport needs to be able to 
conduct thoroughly all the investigations of the many 
complaints they're receiving?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes. And our board has said if they express
additional need, we will certainly revisit that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And, Ms. Pfohl, are you engaging outside
evaluators to determine what kind of a budget that you really 
need to do a thorough investigation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Yes, we are.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And when do you expect that information?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; I would hope that we would, in the next 6 weeks,
we would be able to come back and provide an estimate based on 
what we're seeing now.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;OK. Let me just say this committee is fully
supportive of what your organization was established to do, and 
it appears that the entire community, athletic community is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    And so whatever money you need to actually do your work, 
please let us know and we will work with you and the USOC and 
all of the different organizations to make sure you get that. 
Because that's really going to be critical to resolving all of 
the issues relating to these victims, and that's what we want 
to do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Yes, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair now recognizes Chairman Walden, the
chair of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce, for 5 
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Ms. Lyons, there appears to be a history of the USOC 
knowing about allegations of sexual abuse and doing nothing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Over the years, the USOC has taken a number of positions on 
how much authority it has to protect athletes. USOC officials 
have said they, quote, ``don't have athletes,'' close quote, 
that the Ted Stevens Act doesn't you the authority to mandate 
that the NGBs take action on this issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;As recently as 2016, USOC officials said in a deposition 
that they don't have the authority to, quote, ``do anything,'' 
close quote, if the USOC was concerned about the safety of 
athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    So I want to ask you a simple question: What precisely is 
the authority of the USOC when it comes to protecting athletes?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I think the act gives us a much broader
authority than we have exercised in the past.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So one of the concerns that the committee has
heard repeatedly from survivors is that the USOC is more 
concerned about its own reputation, about medals and money, 
than it is about athlete safety.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;If you would please turn to Tab 3 in the binder, the 
exhibit binder. As you're finding that, I'll just mention this 
is a USOC policy document on athlete safety issued just last 
month. Tab 3.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;If you'll turn to page 7 of Tab 3, there is a list of six 
items that a review panel of USOC officials will consider, 
quote/unquote, in deciding a complaint and imposing a sanction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Can you explain why one of the factors to consider is, and 
I quote, ``the effect on the USOC's reputation''?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I have to admit to not having seen that before.
And I have to say it does not belong on that list.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;OK. I appreciate that candor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;This was not the only document produced to the committee 
that referenced the effect on the USOC's reputation. There's 
also similar language in the USOC SafeSport policy from June of 
2017--that would be on Tab 4--and in the USOC's training access 
protocol from 2011--Tab 5--when the USOC and NGBs would have 
still been responsible for handling complaints of sexual abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    So I would encourage you to review those and act 
appropriately.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Thank you. We will.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Ms. Pfohl, I'm heartened by the progress that's
been made since the creation of SafeSport last year, but I want 
to make sure that the reputation of the USOC or an NGB does not 
play a role in SafeSport decisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;According to SafeSport policies a factor, quote/unquote, 
relevant to determining an appropriate sanction is the, and I 
quote, ``real or perceived impact of the incident on the 
reporting party, NGBs, or USOC.'' Tab 30, page 9.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Again, why is the impact on the NGB or the USOC a factor in 
considering whether a SafeSport violation has occurred and 
whether to issue a sanction? That would be Tab 30 on page 9.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you, sir. Thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    I believe what this is referencing is that if conduct is 
such that it reflects poorly on the sport and those that 
support the sport, then that can be used in terms of making an 
appropriate sanction. Meaning that conduct, poor conduct----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I understand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Ms. Pfohl [continuing]. And its poor reflection on the 
sport matters.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I would just say that, you know, we do a lot of
legislating around here, and words matter. And what you think 
they are and what I think they are, 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 years from 
now somebody may go, ``Oh, well, if we do that, that might 
reflect poorly on the organization if word gets out.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    And I would just caution all of you that, I understand what 
you may think it is, but you better be darn well clear that the 
patient's safety comes first. And I think that's where you're 
headed. I respect that. But it clearly was not where we were in 
the past.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Yes, absolutely. We will absolutely look at that
verbiage. And make no mistake, we work for athletes. That's who 
we work for.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    With that, Mr. Chairman, I'll yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the gentlewoman from Florida, 
Ms. Castor, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Harper.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;I want to focus on whether the culture of winning above all 
else increases the risk of athlete abuse. But first let me say, 
it is horrendous that it has taken a scandal of such epic 
proportions where hundreds of girls in U.S. Gymnastics were 
abused by a doctor to get to this point.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Ms. Lyons, according to The Washington Post, a U.S. Olympic 
Committee attorney was deposed in 2016. When asked about the 
Olympic Committee's priorities, he stated, ``The USOC has a lot 
of priorities. Chief among them is sending athletes to the 
Olympic, Pan American, and Paralympic Games, and doing well at 
those games.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;When asked whether protecting athletes was also a priority, 
this lawyer reportedly said, ``The USOC doesn't have 
athletes,'' implying that the Olympic Committee is not 
responsible for athlete welfare.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    You're familiar with these remarks, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I am familiar with them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;So I firmly believe, as many do, that the
Olympic Committee has a responsibility to protect the health 
and welfare of athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;In February you released a statement outlining seven steps 
you intend to take to ensure a safe sports environment, 
including an effort to, quote, ``implement a culture change at 
USA Gymnastics.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    What do you mean by this culture change? You have given us 
some specifics, but tell us really what you see, what does the 
future hold.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Well, first I would like to say that, you know,
in terms of performance, we believe that performance and safety 
go hand-in-hand. We don't believe that athletes can perform at 
their best unless they are in a safe, respectful, and 
supportive training environment and competitive environment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    In terms of what we need to change in the culture--and I 
think it is across the entire movement, not just within 
gymnastics, and Ms. Perry is doing a lot of work within her own 
organization--we have to, first of all, put that safety much 
more front and center.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; Because it seems like in the past it has been a
culture of protect the coach and not protect the athlete. For 
example, why hasn't it been the policy and will it be the 
policy of actually referring these cases and complaints to 
local law enforcement when they happen?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Well, it is now the law that those types of
cases must be remanded to local law enforcement, and anyone who 
does not do so is violating Federal law. It is critically 
important that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; How have you communicated that to all of the
organizations?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; All of the organizations have received that.
They have all made the changes within their own bylaws and 
other materials. They now are all required to be under the 
jurisdiction of the Center and also to report to law 
enforcement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Ms. Pfohl, this culture change is a key part of
SafeSport's mission. You outlined specific steps that SafeSport 
is taking to make this happen. It is clearly needed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Much of what we're hearing today sounds good, but I'm 
worried that we do not have a way to know whether things will 
actually get better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    One of the concerns is whether or not SafeSport is actually 
independent. What can you tell us to assure us that you're 
acting independently and moving away from the culture of 
protect the coach, protect the organization, to a protect the 
athlete.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you for the question, Representative.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;We have an independent, nine-person board of directors that 
need meet a high standard of independence. They have subject 
matter expertise. They come from an ethics compliance world, 
some of them, and the like. So they hold us to a high standard.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    I can tell you that our investigators are the same. When we 
take on a case in a report we do that in an independent, 
confidential, and professional manner, and we act accordingly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;So one of the issues in the workplace, but I'm
sure it applies here, is retaliation, that you'll have an 
athlete that will come forward with a complaint but the 
organization or the coach then may hear about it some way or 
there might be rumors and then they don't get to compete.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    What is being done to address retaliation and make sure 
that the athletes are protected from it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Again, thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Retaliation is a violation of the SafeSport code and is 
subject to sanction. And the new law, the Protecting Young 
Victims and Safe Sport Authorization Act, puts some teeth into 
that and provides further protections for those coming forward, 
both reporting parties or the victims themselves, the 
survivors, as well as witnesses.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; And then what do you say about referrals to
local law enforcement? What are you saying when a parent or an 
athlete comes forward with a very serious complaint? Are you 
referring those to local law enforcement immediately?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Absolutely. We are mandatory reporters, so we
immediately call law enforcement if they haven't already been 
called. We are double checking to make sure that they are 
called.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    And of course, we let the law enforcement process play out. 
We work collaboratively at all levels, if you will, with law 
enforcement, from the FBI to local law enforcement. And then we 
look at whether a breach of the SafeSport code took place.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;You all set the standard for youth sports and development 
across the country, and we have high expectations for you to 
implement this culture change. And we're going to get back to 
you and keep an eye, as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    And I yield back. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the gentleman from Texas, the 
chairman emeritus, Mr. Barton, 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;I want to thank each of you for participating voluntarily 
in this hearing. We have lots of hearings, but not many are as 
sensitive and important as this one.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Normally I just ask questions extemporaneously, but because 
of the gravity of the situation I'm actually going to basically 
read from some prepared questions because it is so important. 
And I'm going to basically ask the same question toe three of 
you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;The first question is to Susanne Lyons. The committee has 
asked all 48 NGBs to provide, and I quote, ``detailed data to 
demonstrate the number of reports, complaints, or allegations 
of sexual abuse made to the NGB and the handling of that 
information,'' end quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Almost every NGB has responded in some fashion that they 
have not always tracked such information, the report, 
complaint, or allegations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, does it concern you that the NGBs apparently 
have not always tracked such information about complaints of 
sexual abuse?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes, that's a concern. And I will point out that
there was no rule and is no rule at the moment that they have 
to report it to us, as well. They do have to report it to the 
Center, and we are now getting reports from the Center.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Why does not or did not the USOC require such
information, each NGB to track and monitor this type of 
information?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I think the way we operated with the NGBs in the
past was different. There was much more autonomy, and we did 
not exercise the authority that I think the act gives us. I 
think that's one of the reasons we're putting together a 
governance review that I am sure will result in us having a 
much better feedback loop and us following up on those things.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Are you now requiring that such information be
tracked?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; We will be. We are not yet, but we will be.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; When is your timetable to do that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Our governance review is in the process of
getting rolling, and I am absolutely certain that's one of the 
very first things that will occur.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Next question is to Kerry Perry--which, by the
way, that's a nice name, Kerry Perry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;I understand that you are still trying to compile data so 
you can provide the committee with the aggregate number of 
reports, complaints, or allegations made to USA Gymnastics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Can you please explain why it is taking so long to provide 
the committee with the aggregate number of complaints that USA 
Gymnastics has received regarding sexual misconduct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;So since I started in December one of the first things I 
looked at--and to your point, it is very concerning--what type 
of reports have been made, looking at a history. And, 
unfortunately, what I have discovered was that there wasn't a 
lot of great data.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;I can't answer to that. But what I can tell you is, since 
the last several months, we have embarked on a journey to 
really find a really good database for tracking and really 
keeping internally records of everything that is either 
investigated by the Center, sent to the Center, or going 
through the process at USA Gymnastics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;What I can tell you is that, as of January of this year 
through April, USA Gymnastics had approximately 275 cases. Of 
that 275, about 78 went to the Center for sexual abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    I can also tell you that we have recently signed a contract 
with a vendor, in fact, the same that the Center is using, 
because for me it was needed information, and I wanted to make 
sure that we took care of that immediately.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; When do you think your new system is going to
be fully implemented?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; We are in the implementation phase right now,
and so we believe in the next 2 months. But in the meantime we 
are tracking all of the allegations that are coming through in 
a database that has been created internally.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;My last question is for Mr. McNally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    In your response letter your organization has admitted it 
has failed to fully comply with track information about 
allegations of sexual abuse, including oral reports. What type 
of complaints, if any, did Taekwondo track?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; So the reports that I found are the ones that
generally went through the hearing process. There's very little 
information of anything that didn't proceed to that stage.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; So what's Taekwondo's effort right now to
compile this information, to track it, and to follow up on it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; So since I took over we're keeping our own
internal database. But we also were proactively reached out to 
the USOC to see if they were interested in working with us to 
develop a more centralized case tracking. We spoke to that 
chief information officer, and one of their analysts is working 
on----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; So it is an active item?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Yes, very much so, yes. We really need more
historical information, but we also need to make sure that 
nothing ever slips through the cracks again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Thank you for your discretion, Mr. Chairman. I
yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair will now recognize the ranking member
of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;All my questions are of Ms. Pfohl, and I'm going to try to 
get through them quickly, if I can.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I understand that since 2017 the U.S. Center for SafeSport 
has been responsible for investigating all complaints involving 
sexual misconduct. So, Ms. Pfohl, I'm glad that you're here 
today so we can learn exactly how SafeSport operates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    My first question is, if you would briefly walk me through 
what happens when SafeSport receives a complaint from an 
athlete. I know this probably varies based on the type of 
complaint. But generally speaking, what takes place?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you for the question, Representative
Pallone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;So when a call or if a report comes in through our Web 
site, however it comes in, it can be an email, it can be 
anonymously, it could be a third party, we are immediately 
triaging those reports. Obviously what we look for is, do we 
need to call law enforcement? So is sexual abuse of a minor 
part of that report? We immediately call law enforcement if 
that's the case.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;At the same time we are also looking at, is someone in 
harm's way? And if we feel like that's the case, then we will 
immediately impose an interim measure or an interim suspension.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;From there, the investigation continues with a qualified 
investigator that is versed in trauma-informed investigations. 
And we are of course talking to the reporting party as well as 
the responding party or the alleged individual for which the 
report is on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    From there, again, collecting information from them, 
collecting information from witnesses. Sometimes there are a 
lot of witnesses. Sometimes not. So that impacts the length of 
the investigation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt; How long does it take for you to complete an
investigation typically?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;It depends. It depends on all of those factors.
How many investigations? Are there more than one reporting 
party? How far back does it go? All of those things weigh in.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    We're averaging 63 days right now from start to finishing, 
average. Some are much longer, some are shorter.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt; Now, who has the final say on how case is
resolved?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;We have a director or of investigations and
decisions, that once our investigators do their work--and by 
the way, we deal in facts, so we have a fair process whereby 
the facts are gathered. Those facts go in the form of a report 
to the director of investigations. He is determining whether a 
breach of the SafeSport code took place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    If a breach took place, then a sanction is administered. 
And that sanction could be anything from a warning to a 
permanent ineligibility. And there are options for hearings and 
arbitration both at the interim measure as well as the 
sanctioning stage.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I don't know if I'm going to get through all
this, but you mentioned referral to law enforcement. For 
example, Mr. McNally's written testimony describes challenges 
that U.S. Taekwondo faced when it reported cases to law 
enforcement, such as being told that law enforcement does not 
even want a target to know that he or she is being 
investigated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    So let me ask you, what steps can SafeSport take to protect 
athletes while law enforcement is investigating a case? And 
does SafeSport take steps to keep athletes informed of the 
status of an investigation when law enforcement is involved?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you. That's an important question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Absolutely. So we would work with law enforcement. And it 
is true, depending on the case, the law enforcement agent or 
agency may want us to not work on the investigation formally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    However, we have the obligation to protect athletes, so we 
would work with them, let them know that, look, we need to put 
in an interim measure so that athletes are protected. And 
athlete safety comes first.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;All right. Let me just skip over, because I
wanted to ask one more thing, and probably all I have time for.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I understand the type of complaints that SafeSport manages 
requires a complete investigative process, but the concern is 
that some people might not understand how this process works 
and that this lack of understanding may keep some individuals 
from coming forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    So what steps has SafeSport taken to explain to athletes 
how this process works? And do you believe that all the sports 
governing bodies and athletes have a complete understanding of 
your authority and how your investigative process works so that 
they would actually not hesitate to come forward?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Right. I think we're still in the stage of
getting the word out and building trust among really the 13 
million individuals that are part of the Olympic and Paralympic 
movements, absolutely.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;But we're doing that through our prevention work as well, 
the online training, our education. I'll say the USOC has 
helped us with a couple of PSAs that are now being shown on 
national television and at events.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    So we're looking to continue these sorts of partnerships 
with all of the national governing bodies and the USOC because 
they have direct access to all of their members. So we're 
working on information that's on their Web site. We have got to 
make that consistent across all of the NGBs. And that's being 
worked out right now.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The Chair would like to welcome to the dais Congressman 
Doug Lamborn, who is from Colorado Springs, Colorado.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Glad to have you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    And the Chair will recognize the vice chairman----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; His district includes the U.S. Olympic
Committee.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;In Colorado Springs, absolutely.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    And so the Chair will recognize the vice chairman of the 
subcommittee, Mr. Griffith, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Ms. Lyons, if you'll turn to Tab 7, you will see the 
recommendations from the United States Olympic Committee's 2010 
Working Group for Safe Training Environments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    What specific events led to the creation of the working 
group in 2010?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; The working group really was created in the
aftermath of many of the swimming allegations that came out in 
2010. And while that NGB began to work on their own issues, we 
developed a working group to look more broadly across the whole 
system.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;And in response to the 2010 working group's 
recommendations, the USOC launched SafeSport in 2012. Then in 
2013 the USOC established a SafeSport Working Group, and the 
2013 working group recommended that case management for sexual 
misconduct cases should be consolidated under a new independent 
entity with an independent board of directors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;As you will see in Tab 8, the USOC approved the creation of 
the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2014. The Center, however, was 
not launched until March 3, 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Tell me why it took 7 years since the working group was 
created and nearly 3 years from the USOC approving the U.S. 
Center for SafeSport until that Center was launched.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;First, let me say it did take too long. There
are some reasons why it took a while, funding being one, 
insurance issues being another, very complicated, and trying to 
get all of the national governing bodies to do the earlier 
steps that preceded the Center, which was to put in some 
mandatory requirements and to get them in compliance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    But, frankly, it took too long, and we regret that it did 
not open sooner. It may have saved some of the tragedy that 
occurred.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; Given that it took so long to get the Center
started, did the USOC handle any cases of sexual misconduct for 
the national governing bodies or assist those NGBs prior to the 
Center's launch in March of 2017?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; There is a sort of an escalation process, and at
times if an issue could not be resolved within a national 
governing body it can then come be escalated up to the USOC. 
And there were a number of cases that we would become involved 
in during that time, as well. It is far superior for it to go 
to an independent body as it does today.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; All right. So let me ask you this. Would
those cases, if something happened and somebody was banned or 
there was disciplinary action, show up on the Center's Web site 
where you can go check to see if somebody has been disciplined?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I think that our banned lists are very
incomplete today. And I'm very glad you brought it up, because 
it is one of the first things we need to do. We have to have 
consistency against the NGBs collecting that information. To 
the extent that we have cases, we have to collect it. It all 
needs to be ultimately put together in one database where 
everyone will have transparency to it. That does not exist 
today.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Keeping with that, Mr. Hinchey, the work that you all did, 
you all actually started in 2010 and worked with SafeSport 
before the Center was opened up. Are your cases in a database 
where people can go search? If so, they can see who has been 
banned? Or have you given that information to the Center and 
you can search it there?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; We have a banned list that is published on our
Web site.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;OK. I appreciate that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Back to you, Ms. Lyons. I just wanted to get that one in. 
Is the U.S. Center for SafeSport now functional as a completely 
independent entity or does the U.S. Center for SafeSport rely 
on the USOC and/or the NGBs for any investigational purposes?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; The Center is not relying on us for
investigational purposes. We are assisting with the funding, as 
you know, but they are indeed an independent body.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; So your role at this point is just funding?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Funding, and also help and advise on broader
issues. They are in their growth stage, just as when we started 
USADA----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; But not investigative?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Not investigating. We have no role in that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; Mr. Hinchey, I'm going to shift to you. You
indicated in your oral statement that 90-plus individuals have 
been banned from USA Swimming for sexual misconduct-related 
violations since the inception of your SafeSport program in the 
fall of 2010. Is that accurate? Did I understand that 
correctly?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; Yes, that's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; All right. And how have USA Swimming's
policies and procedures changed regarding how you handle sexual 
misconduct claims since the U.S. Center for SafeSport was 
launched in 2017?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; Over the course of that transition, which
started July 1 of last year, there have been 75 complaints that 
have gone straight to the U.S. Center for SafeSport from our 
governing body. But they now handle the adjudication, they 
handle the initial complaints, but we're here to support it in 
any way we can.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; All right. You have heard concerns from Ms.
Lyons in how long it took since you all were involved at USA 
Swimming in the creation of the U.S. Center for SafeSport and 
started your own program in 2010. Were you all concerned about 
the amount of time it took to launch the U.S. Center for 
SafeSport?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; Clearly it should have been started earlier.
Having said that, we also take responsibility for our own 
problems. And, you know, regardless of whatever time it took it 
to get the independent group going, which we do think is great 
and we want to support it, these are still our problems, and we 
need to step up and take responsibility.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I appreciate that. Both you and I are
swimmers and we love the sport, and there's a lot of positives 
we're not going over today. And I wish I could tell countless 
stories of people who have benefited from these programs, but 
we have got to take care of the problems, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize Mr. Tonko for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;And thank you to our witnesses for joining us today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Routine audits are essential to promote athlete safety and 
to ensure that athlete safety policies are implemented 
correctly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Last year the Olympic Committee retained consulting firm 
Baker Tilly to conduct an audit of the U.S. Olympic Committee 
and all national governing bodies to assess their 
implementation of the new SafeSport requirements. Rick Adams, 
the committee's chief of Paralympic sports and national 
governing body organizational development, told the Senate 
judiciary committee last year that they were unique one-time 
audits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, the October 2017 audit recommended that the 
Olympic Committee address 10 areas in need of improvement. I 
believe they're referenced in exhibit 2. Very briefly, what did 
you learn from having those audits conducted and implementing 
these recommendations? Was it a useful process?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Yes, it's a very useful process, and I think
audits will be a bigger part of what we do going forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;What we learned--and part of this was as we were putting in 
new processes and procedures--is that it is--all NGBs are 
different. Some have better capabilities to very quickly adopt 
change, others require more help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    I am glad to say that all of the NGBs that had deficiencies 
through that audit process have now come up to standard. And we 
will be repeating that audit process on a rotating basis to 
ensure that we continue compliance.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;OK. And as part of this audit work they found
that two of our witnesses today, USA Volleyball and USA 
Taekwondo, had areas where they needed to enhance the design of 
their systems and make recommendations on how they could do so. 
So the value of these audits is clear.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Going forward, I believe it is important to regularly 
assess SafeSport policies and their implementation to ensure 
that they are effective in their protecting of the athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    So I want to ask you, Ms. Pfohl, if her organization plans 
to undertake regular performance audits to ensure it is meeting 
the needs of the massive sporting organizing it is now charged 
with protecting.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    The new legislation, the Protecting Young Victims and Safe 
Sport Authorization Act, calls on the Center to perform regular 
and random audits of the NGBs. And so, yes, we intend to do 
that, resources permitting.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; And, Ms. Pfohl, again, what is the Center for
SafeSport doing to assess how effective SafeSport policies are 
in reducing the likelihood of abuse?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you for that question, as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;We actually have now an outside consultant, a firm coming 
in actually to go through the cases that we have already closed 
to determine if there's something that we missed, is there 
something that we could have done better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;So already in our--just over our first year we're already 
doing a look back and saying, ``OK, how did we do?''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    So we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to look at 
policies. We are always looking for best practices, and when we 
see best practices and new policies that need to be put into 
place we will do so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; And do you plan to have regular performance
audits of SafeSport's performance?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; OK. And do you believe that you have sufficient
resources to periodically audit how well the SafeSport system 
is performing?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; I would say that our resources are limited in
that area in terms of self-audits, if you will. But our goal, 
and I know it is a high priority for our board, we will find 
the resources to be able to do it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    And finally, do you plan to have regular audits done of the 
sports governing bodies to ensure that they are implementing 
their SafeSport policies going forward?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Yes, sir. As I mentioned, that is called for in
the Safe Sport Authorization Act.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; And then to any of the panel, beyond audits,
what can be done to protect the athlete?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; I think from my perspective, Congressman, that
we need to empower the athletes. We need to hear their voices. 
We need to get them involved in the process. And that's 
something we hadn't done at the start of our process, but 
something we've learned over the last 8 years, and we intend to 
do that coming forward.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; Mr. Hinchey, that's a good point, and thank you.
And how would we do that? What's the structure by which to 
empower their voices?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; We need to invite them to be part of the
process. And right now, as an example, for us, we started a 
working group that's a combination of some athletes, Olympic 
athletes, local coaches, board members, six women and five men, 
to start to really vet where we have been and where we need to 
go.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; Does anyone else want to add to that statement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;I would like to add that I think we're focusing
a lot on the aftermath of abuse. I think one of the most 
important things we can do is education that prevents abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;And much of the Centers' charge going forward is that 
education, which goes beyond the NGBs and their members. It 
goes down to every gym and every dojo in America where a 6-
year-old is training.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    We need to enlist the Boys and Girls Clubs and all the 
other organizations and get parents educated so that people 
know earlier how to spot these signs of grooming and signs that 
may lead to abuse so that we can stop these cases before they 
occur.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize Dr. Burgess for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Chairman,
let me just say I have been on this subcommittee for a long 
time, along with a couple of other members, and this has been 
one of the most difficult hearings to research and prepare for. 
And I appreciate so much everyone participating today, because 
it's so important that we get it right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Mr. Griffith referenced the positive aspects that, 
unfortunately, we're not really able to spotlight today because 
of the nature of the hearing. I have a university in my 
district, Texas Woman's University, my staff handed me a 
newspaper article from last month, April 16: Texas Woman's 
University secured the program's 11th USA Gymnastics Collegiate 
national title on Saturday and registered the highest score 
ever seen in the championship.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Clearly, you all are in this for the athletes, and that's 
for the right reason, because the benefits returned from these 
programs are significant for the athletes themselves, their 
families, clearly their colleges, their universities, and the 
communities where they reside. So I don't want to lose sight of 
that fact even though what we're looking into is just 
astonishing in how difficult it is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;So as someone with a medical background one of the things 
that has just been very difficult for me is how a medical 
professional has caused all of this damage. And this individual 
was licensed in the State of Michigan, but not in the State of 
Texas. And under our current laws, States are responsible for 
licensing the people who provide medical care within their 
borders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;So, Ms. Lyons and Ms. Perry, I guess my question is to you. 
And I'll ask you, Ms. Pfohl, the same thing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;This individual, not licensed in Texas, was providing 
services, care, whatever he did, at the Karolyi Ranch in Texas, 
not licensed by the State of Texas. So how do you go about 
ensuring that physicians that are taking care of your athletes 
are compliant with licensing obligations?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    And, Ms. Lyons, I guess we'll start with you and then we'll 
go to Ms. Perry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Well, I think that's one reason we want to
embark upon our-- why we have our independent investigation 
from Ropes &amp;amp; Gray underway, to find out actually how some of 
these gaps in the systems occurred.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    There are supposed to be background checks. There's 
supposed to be medical certification checks. I may have to 
defer to my colleague. The national governing bodies are 
responsible for the licensing of their own physicians, but 
those checks are meant to happen. And I think the investigation 
will help us understand if they did or did not and why.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And we see what a serious breach this was when
this didn't happen in this case.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    And, Ms. Perry, I guess that when an individual signs on to 
a training program at a ranch like this, I mean, presumably 
there's some type of consent that is entered into. Is that not 
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;First, I want to say it is horrific. And, you
know, every day that I wake up I think about how do we make 
sure as an entity that we are doing everything we can to 
protect our athletes. That's why I took this position in 
December.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;And so one of the things that we are looking at, as Ms. 
Lyons talked about, was finding out the facts that could have 
led up to such a horrible situation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;And so having the Ropes &amp;amp; Gray independent investigation is 
very important to us, and it is very important to me, to learn, 
so that we can make sure that we go down the right path.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    One of the things that I looked at immediately was that I 
did not want our athletes to ever return to a place where they 
had abuse. So as you all know, we closed the ranch.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;That was very important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    But on a go-forward, I think it really does make a big 
difference that as a national governing body we look at 
everything--we look at our structure, we look at our policies, 
we look at our systems, we look at our medical--and we hold 
ourselves to the highest standard. Because, ultimately, we 
represent and we advocate our athletes, and I am committed to 
that every day.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;So, I mean, just to point out the obvious
here, though, you had an unlicensed physician taking care of 
people. I don't know if the parents of these children were 
apprised of the fact: Here's a physician who is not licensed in 
the State of Texas who is going to be participating in the 
training program. It is wrong on so many levels, and, 
unfortunately, now we see the consequences of that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    And I guess I just have to ask, I mean, who paid for this 
doctor? Was it something the parents had to pay for? Did the 
ranch pay for it? Who was responsible for paying for this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; From my understanding, he was a volunteer, but
he was paid expenses. I believe everybody knows he was an 
employee of Michigan State, but he was a volunteer for USA 
Gymnastics.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;OK. All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Well, Mr. Chairman, I have got so many more questions, and 
I will submit them for the record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Mr. Davis, I really thank you for your testimony today. It 
underscores the point of how important it is that we get this 
right. We can think we have got it right, and then it turns out 
we didn't get it right, and then years later you have to 
continue to deal with the problems from not getting it right. 
It is important that we be right on this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt; Thank you, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the gentlewoman from Illinois, 
Ms. Schakowsky, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;I just want to begin with a statement about your testimony, 
shocking that Rick Butler, after being banned for abusing 
underage girls, appealed that lifetime ban and was reinstated. 
It is just incredible. And that it wasn't until January of 
2018, this year, that there is a lifetime ban. This really 
underscores the problem that has occurred over so many years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Anyone in this room, I think, certainly the women know, if 
someone has abused underage girls, reinstating him is so 
unacceptable. He should have been in jail. And now, in today's, 
world I think he would have. I hope he would have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Let me just turn to--I would like to recognize Arlene Limas 
in the audience.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;If you would stand, Arlene, if she is still here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Arlene is an Olympic athlete and taekwondo coach, and we 
met about 2 months ago and she shared with me chilling stories 
about sexual abuse at training camps and competitions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Mr. McNally, last year three of your athletes were awarded 
$60 million in damages--a total of--after a judge found that a 
coach sexually abused them. You're familiar with that, correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    Could you say into the mike?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Yes, I am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Taekwondo also allegedly permitted an athlete and a coach 
to participate in the 2016 Olympics even though there were 
unresolved sexual misconduct allegations against them. 
SafeSport finally recommended an interim ban against those 
individuals just this year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    Are you familiar with this matter, as well?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Yes, I am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; In the case of John Lopez, you mentioned
multiple investigations and attempts to ban Mr. Lopez in 2013 
and 2015. But my understanding is that these efforts were 
unrelated to sexual abuse. Is that true?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Yes. That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; And the topic of this hearing, by the way,
is about sexual abuse. And isn't it also true that it wasn't 
until 2018 that Mr. Lopez was sanctioned for sexual misconduct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Yes. That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;OK. I think that identifies a problem here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    Your March 21, 2018, letter to this committee indicated 
that there are roughly two dozen individuals facing suspensions 
or lifetime bans from your sport. Were any of these reported to 
law enforcement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;I believe yes. Some of them actually came from
law enforcement through cases where they were charged. As soon 
as they were charged they were suspended. Some of them went to 
prison and were added through there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;    I don't know about every case historically, but since I 
took over, and even earlier than that, since the incorporation 
of the SafeSport Center, every case has been--with a criminal 
element--has been turned over to law enforcement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; I would like to know how many of the
roughly two dozen have been referred to law enforcement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; So that's something----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; You'll get that to me, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Yes, I will.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    Mr. McKinley, how is it that U.S. Taekwondo addressing--how 
is Taekwondo addressing the assistant coaches and team managers 
that may have had a role in covering up sexual abuse in your 
sport?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Every report that we get, every report that is
submitted to us, is immediately submitted to the U.S. Center 
for SafeSports.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;I'm asking a different question. If there
are individuals within the sport that are silent, that are 
covering up, that don't tell you. Because I think probably for 
every one of these cases of sexual abuse someone knew about it 
and didn't say anything.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    So what is the process there?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; So we are looking to, as Mr. Hinchey said, to
empower the athletes. We're launching our #notinmysport 
campaign to encourage athletes to come forward. We are much 
more open, I believe, at regaining the trust of the athlete 
community. They know that I will deal with this if it comes to 
me. And I would encourage anybody with one of those stories who 
has been silent up until now----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; What about the coach community, too?
There's assistant coaches, there's all kind of staff.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Anybody who has knowledge of anything, however
small, however serious, I encourage them to bring it to me.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; I'm still asking a different question. What
if you know that there have been people that have been silent 
that knew of these abuses, is there any sanction at all?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; We deal with every report that comes to us.
That is why in 2015 USA Taekwondo preceded the independent body 
of the SafeSport Center by appointing our----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;I guess I'll have to ask the question more
precisely in writing, because my time is up. But it seems to me 
that whether it's reported or not, that you ought to do 
inquiries to find out who has stood by and watched sexual abuse 
occur.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    And I have to yield back. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The Chair will now recognize the gentlewoman from Indiana, 
Mrs. Brooks, who is also the chair of the Ethics Committee in 
the House.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mrs. Brooks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Ms. Pfohl, I'd like to focus a number of my questions on 
you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;If you would turn to Tab 9, it talks about the Center 
receiving 488 written and oral reports, complaints, and 
allegations regarding sexual abuse since the Center launched 
until April 13, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Now, this is a significant number of cases. I'm also a 
former U.S. Attorney, Federal prosecutor involved in child 
exploitation cases and so forth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Given the significant number of cases that your Center has 
received, how is the Center prioritizing cases in any way, if 
you are?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    And I have a number of questions, and so if we could be 
brief, and we may ask for more answers in written form.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you, Congresswoman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;We triage the cases as they come in.Again, if they need to 
go to law enforcement, that happens. We're inputting interim 
measures. If individuals are active, if it involves a minor, 
those are prioritized.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And can you please share with us in Tab 9 
that, as we have already heard, the allegations come from 35 of 
the 48 NGBs, and how are you working with the NGBs to make 
sure--and athletes, as we have talked about, the priority in 
athletes--to make sure that they are familiar that SafeSport--
that the Center exists and the policies and procedures? I know 
the NGBs do, but how do we make sure that athletes know you 
exist?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Great question. Thank you again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;By the way, I think we're up to 38 of the sports now, the 
NGBs sports.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;So how we do that----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Thirty-eight of the 48 have allegations?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thirty-eight, correct, have at least one report
that we have received, at least one report.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;So, again, we work with the NGBs. We have now a full-time 
NGB resources manager, and her job, every day, all day, is to 
communicate back and forth with the NGBs to give them 
consistent information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;To listen to them also, for them to tell us what they need. 
For example, we heard they needed parent toolkits. We have a 
parent toolkit now on our Web site that anyone can access.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Are any of the NGBs not cooperating with you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;No, ma'am.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And I understand NGBs are various sizes and 
have various----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Resources, yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And various resources. But it is fair to say 
that all NGBs today are cooperating with you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;To the best of my knowledge, every NGB is
cooperating.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. In the 2018 omnibus Congress established a 
grant program to help keep our young athletes safe. Have the 
Attorney General and the Justice Department, to your knowledge, 
set up the grant program yet and established the timing and 
content of the application of that grant?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Ma'am, we have not seen the RFP come out, the
guidance come out yet regarding that grant program, but we look 
forward to it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And it was a $2.5 million grant program, is my 
understanding?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Yes. Yes, ma'am.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. If the Center for SafeSport were to apply for 
this grant, and we will be making inquiries as to what is 
taking time to establish this grant program authorized by 
Congress and passed in the omnibus, how would those grant funds 
be used if Center for SafeSport were to receive those funds?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Absolutely. To expand our response, meaning our response 
and resolution. To be able to add more investigators. Also 
remember, the bill did call for us to do regular and random 
audits of the NGBs, again, so that we can further work and get 
the word out through them to the athletes, directly to 
athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Have the audits begun yet?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;No.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And why is that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;We don't have the resources to do the audits
yet.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And have you made any requests yet of the USOC 
or of the NGBs for more resources?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Not--no, ma'am, not since the doubling of the
support from the USOC. We are, of course, now looking to 2019 
and looking at the contributions from all of the national 
governing bodies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;And thanks, Tim, for stepping up and saying you could do 
more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. There is no statute of limitations. I want to 
get that out, as well.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Correct, correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. You mentioned there are no statute of 
limitations with regard to the reporting.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Or with regard to your investigations.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And there has been some criticism with respect 
to the independence. I would like for you to tell us what is 
the Center doing to ensure athletes can trust the Center's 
independence and reporting of these allegations.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Absolutely. So thank you again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;I don't answer to anyone at the USOC or any of the national 
governing bodies, nor does anyone on my team.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Do you expect the funding to always come from 
the USOC?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Our goal, ma'am, is to diversify that funding.
We are looking at foundation funds, and some of that is 
starting to come in now. Certainly if the Federal--if we are 
able to receive some Federal dollars that will help diversify, 
as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;I can't imagine a time where the USOC and the NGBs would 
not be investing in this space. I think they should be and will 
continue to be. But I also think that we can diversify that, 
especially in the area of prevention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;And for the record, I'll be submitting a record for all of 
the panelists and commending USA Gymnastics for beginning the 
Athlete Task Force and will be asking--my time is up--as to 
whether or not each of the NGBs are creating an Athlete Task 
Force, which will shape your organization's future in their 
decisions and their operating decisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    With that, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize Ms. Clarke for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;I thank you, Chairman Harper and Ranking Member
DeGette, for holding this hearing today on this important topic 
of how we must protect our Nation's most elite club of 
athletes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;Being an Olympian is a coveted title not easily given, and 
is not limited by age, with the youngest at only 13 years old. 
This protected class of youth, who display exceptional ability, 
should not have to worry if they will be violated by a trusted 
coach or any adult in the room.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;Given what we have learned through the sentencing of Dr. 
Larry Nassar, it is Congress' responsibility and obligation to 
ensure that strong and appropriate measures are put in place so 
that trusted personnel are held accountable to the highest 
standard of conduct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;    Having said that, Ms. Lyons, earlier this year the U.S. 
Olympic Committee threatened USA Gymnastics with 
decertification. The U.S. Olympic Committee demanded that all 
members of the USA Gymnastics board resign, which they did. Is 
that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;So the U.S. Olympic Committee can use its
authority to require sports governing bodies to adopt certain 
standards. It can demand changes, as it did with USA 
Gymnastics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;Documents provided to the committee show that sports 
governing bodies have different policies on key safety issues. 
For example, some sports' governing bodies make lists of banned 
coaches and other members make it publicly available, others do 
not.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, why do some governing bodies post public lists 
while others do not?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;I think that consistency is an incredibly
important part of what we need to achieve going forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;To date, as you mentioned, they're very different. Keeping 
banned lists is a complicated issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;At the same time, we need to figure it out and we need to 
ensure that centralized information is provided by every single 
NGB and that it's accessible to the public.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    It has not happened to date, and I regret that we did not 
exercise more of our authority to enforce that as a standard 
for the NGBs prior to this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt; So will you be doing that? Is that something
that you will enforce?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; That has been added to my to-do list this very
week.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;Ms. Lyons, your May 16, 2018, letter to us states that the 
U.S. Olympic Committee recognizes the need for greater 
transparency and uniformity with respect to sexual assault.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;    Shouldn't there be uniformity regarding public lists? You 
stated that that's on your to-do list. And in this area, where 
the Olympic Committee could demand that governing bodies make 
these changes, what is your timetable?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We do need to confer with all of our NGB
partners because, as you know, they are very different in size 
and they are very different in their technological 
capabilities. I'm guessing that we may need to help provide a 
technology tool that can be used by those that don't have their 
own tool.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    So I couldn't yet speculate on the timeframe, but we will 
put that on an urgent path because I can't see how that's not 
an important part of our----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;Yes. And where there's need for support, I
think, you know, this is a valuable use of resource. It's 
important that we standardize this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;And I understand that sports governing bodies are now 
required to report all new cases to the Center for SafeSport. 
But nationally, governing bodies are not required to submit 
pre-March 2017 cases to the Center for SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;A recent headline in USA Today on March 16, 2018, 
reads:``USA Gymnastics makes puzzling decision to keep sexual 
abuse case.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, how do we know that cases predating SafeSport's 
opening are being addressed appropriately?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; The Center has the option to take some of the
preexisting cases if it chooses. There is a sensitivity that if 
a victim has already been through a good part of the 
investigatory process, that perhaps it may not be beneficial to 
them to go through it again. So in some of those cases, the 
NGBs have opted to keep a case that's already in progress. But 
the Center can choose to take that if it wishes to.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt; Who is examining that to make sure that there's
transparency and that there's a coherence to a standard and 
that there's no short shrifting in terms of determining what 
rises to the occasion of a crime and what doesn't?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I would have to say when I read the article I
had the same question. And I'm not certain of the answer. But I 
will be looking into that. But clearly, we should make sure 
that the Center is aware of all these cases and has the option 
to take them if they feel it's appropriate. I'm not sure that 
it is currently the standard.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;Well, I hope you will give scrutiny to that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;    And I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the gentleman from Michigan, 
Mr. Walberg, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;And thanks to the panel for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Coming from Michigan, this issue hits especially close to 
home, sadly. What happened at USAG and MSU under Larry Nassar 
is terrible, unacceptable, unexplainable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Thankfully, hundreds of brave young women came forward to 
tell their stories, helped put the predatory, Dr.Nassar--I 
guess I would change that--put the predator, Nassar, behind 
bars and close the chapter on just one of many incidents that 
we have heard about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;As an aside, Ms. Pfohl, thank you for stating the U.S. 
Center for SafeSport's mission statement and restating it as 
well. It is good to hear.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;The mission statement for the U.S. Olympic Committee states 
it this way: Its mission is to support U.S. Olympic and 
Paralympic competitive excellence while demonstrating the 
values of the Olympic movement, thereby inspiring all 
Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, did this incident even remotely follow the 
mission of the USOC?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;First, I would say that I think the athletes do
continue to inspire all Americans. And I think, sadly, the 
institutions that support those athletes have not inspired 
confidence, trust, or have lived up to our mission and values, 
and we deeply regret that that has occurred.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    And that is one reason why we are embarking upon all of the 
action plans that we've discussed, because the athletes deserve 
to have everyone believe that the work that they do and what 
the Olympics stands for should be held in highest esteem, and 
we have let them down.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;I appreciate you stating that, knowing you
weren't there in this position at the time all of this went 
down. But I think it is important that the commitment to that 
mission statement is affirmed and affirmed and affirmed still 
further.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;    And so, Ms. Perry, I would also ask similarly, did what 
happened in Michigan with the predator, Mr. Nassar, and USA 
Gymnastics even remotely resemble the mission statement I just 
read?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;I was there at the hearings. And I want to say,
first, that every moment that I think about what our athletes 
went through it energizes me and gives me a sense of resolve 
every single day to make sure that we're focusing every part of 
our organization on athlete safety.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;And as an organization, one of the first things that I did 
in December was to look at the mission statement of USA 
Gymnastics, and we changed that mission statement. And our 
mission statement now focuses on empowering our athletes and 
focusing on athlete safety and making sure that we educate our 
members to that extent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    And I will tell you that it's something every single day I 
think about. And so we want to do whatever we have to do as an 
organization to make sure that we prevent. As you all 
mentioned, one case of sexual abuse is one too many.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;I appreciate that. Then let's continue to look
back a bit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Public reports indicate that USAG officials knew about 
Nassar in the summer of 2015, and USAG officials notified USOC 
officials shortly thereafter, in July 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;    In addition to notifying the FBI, did USAG implement any 
formal and public interim measures on Dr.Nassar while the FBI 
conducted its investigation to ensure that athletes did not 
continue to be at risk while the investigation was under way?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;I don't have firsthand knowledge, but it is my
understanding that Mr. Nassar was asked to step away.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    There is a really important investigation going on right 
now, as you mentioned, the Ropes &amp;amp; Gray, which I think is 
critically important for all of us so that we can shed light on 
what happened.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; But did he step away?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I would--did he step away at that point?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; At that point.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; It is my understanding that he did, but I would
need to see all the facts around that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; I encourage you to check those facts out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Because it appears that there was still
involvement that went on. And at the very least there was a 
coverup. Things weren't transparent or clear. And I think that 
added to the frustration of athletes and parents, and the 
general public as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;    So I would encourage you to continue looking for those 
questions----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;I understand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    Mr. Walberg [continuing]. To make sure it never happens 
again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I understand. And I will be relentless in my
efforts every day. And I believe that the Ropes &amp;amp; Gray 
investigation is going to really provide a lot of information 
that I think I and many others would like to see.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; Thanks. And I wish you well.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The Chair will now recognize the gentlewoman from 
California, Mrs. Walters, for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mrs. Walters.. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;First of all, I would like to start off by saying that as a 
mother of four whose kids played local organized sports growing 
up, this is a difficult hearing topic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;It is really upsetting to think that my kids and their 
teammates could have been coached by someone who had a history 
of misconduct, and even more disturbing to think that I and the 
rest of the parents would not have known if that was the case 
because, as we've recently learned, in most cases lists 
containing the names of banned or suspended coaches isn't 
public information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;NGBs have different policies regarding whether they 
maintain a list of banned coaches, and if they do, whether they 
publicize the list.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The committee asked all 48 NGBs and the USOC whether or not 
they maintained a list of individuals banned or suspended from 
participation with the NGB, and if so, whether the list was 
publicly available.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Only 18 NGBs have a banned or suspended list that is 
available to the general public. Other NGBs reported to the 
committee that they shared banned or suspended lists with their 
members but do not publicly post those lists, have banned lists 
but only share it with certain officials, maintain a searchable 
database of members in good standing, or have not been banned 
or suspended any individuals but would make a list public if 
they were to do so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;As you can see, there's a wide variation in whether and how 
the NGBs and USOC make their banned or suspended list publicly 
available. There are clear benefits to having a publicly 
available list.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, why hasn't it the USOC mandated that all NGBs 
maintain a list, and, further, that they make this list 
publicly available?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We will be working with our NGB partners. I
think that we will probably all be in agreement that we need to 
find a good way to do this so that that information is 
available, transparent, and all in one centralized place where 
people can find it. It doesn't exist today, but we will make 
that a priority for us all to make that happen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    Mrs. Walters.. So then you will consider mandating that all 
NGBs publish a public list of all banned or suspended 
individuals?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Yes, I think there's a number of things that
will end up getting on the new compliance list that have not 
been there before as we exercise some more authority in this 
area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Mrs. Walters.. OK. And this question is for you also.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    If an NGB puts an individual on a banned or suspended list, 
would the USOC grant that person access to an Olympic center or 
event?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;That should not occur. If that information is
visible to us, then we have processes and procedures that would 
ensure that a person could not get on to an Olympic training 
site or an Olympic training center, that they would not be 
certified to go to games that we were supervising.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;So to your point earlier, the availability of that 
information is critical. I think the right procedures are in 
place to keep them from entering a location, but you have to 
know that they're banned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Mrs. Walters.. OK. Because the production that the USOC 
made to the committee last week included an email from 2016 
regarding someone who had been recently suspended by USA 
Taekwondo for 5 years due to serious SafeSport violations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;According to the email, notwithstanding the suspension, 
this individual was issued a day pass for the High Performance 
Center in Rio by the USOC. It states, and I quote: ``This pass 
was not officially requested by USA Taekwondo and this 
individual is not someone we would grant access to.'' And it 
continues: ``It appears one of our coaches went directly to 
USOC staff with the request without our approval and somehow 
obtained the pass directly.'' And that's an end quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Another coach complained about this person being around 
female athletes. USA Taekwondo's banned or suspended list is 
public. USA Taekwondo banned this individual for 5 years and 
the USOC granted him access to an official center at the Rio 
Olympics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    How do you explain this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;It certainly should not have happened. And it
does point to one of the reasons we're putting together an 
athlete safety commission to look at where these gaps in the 
system are.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;It shouldn't occur. That type of information needs to be 
available so that people in those venues would immediately know 
to check that list. It should have happened in any case. It did 
not.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Mrs. Walters.. Well, I want to highlight what the email 
also said, because it went on to say: ``Please help me 
understand how this could have happened, as these things have 
happened consistently in the past, so this is not an isolated 
incident. Neither is it something we can just ignore given the 
seriousness of the adjudicated complaints.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    So my point is that this is something that consistently had 
happened. And how did that possibly consistently happen?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Clearly, there was not an appropriate policy or
check in place, a check and balance there was a policy to 
ensure it was being followed. So we have to do better, and we 
have to find out why that happen and make sure it does not 
happen in the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Mrs. Walters.. OK. I'm out of time. I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    Mr. Griffith [presiding]. I now recognize the gentleman 
from Georgia for 5 minutes, Mr. Carter.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Ms. Perry, I'll start with you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Ms. Perry, I have the honor and privilege of representing 
the First Congressional District of Georgia, which includes 
Effingham County, Georgia, Rincon, Georgia. You ever heard of 
it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; You have?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Of Effingham----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Rincon, Georgia. Effingham County, Georgia.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I have.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Yes, I'm sure you have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    You're aware of a lawsuit, Jane Does v. USA Gymnastics?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; You are. And that lawsuit was settled just last
month, I believe.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Recently.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Recently. Beginning of April it was. That is
correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Let me ask you something. Just to give you an idea of what 
happened here, there was a gentleman, a gymnast, who opened up 
a gym in 2002 in Effingham County. He opened up a gym. And in a 
newspaper story, it stated that McCabe--his name is Bill 
McCabe, by the way--he's in prison for 30 years, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;But in 2002 he opened up a gym. A newspaper
article said, ``McCabe and a new partner/girlfriend opened 
Savannah Metro Gymnastics in Rincon, Georgia. ... Both are USA 
Gymnastics Professional members and USA Gymnastics safety-
certified. Bill is also a USA Gymnastics Skill Evaluator. Bill 
has been teaching since 1991.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Of course, what happened is that the mother of an 8-year-
old enrolled her daughter there. And then what happened was 
that for 3 years, until the middle of 2005, that daughter was 
in classes there with this sexual predator, is essentially what 
he was.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;And then what happened was that she went out to her car one 
day and she found an envelope on her car, and it had all these 
details about what previous problems that Bill McCabe had had.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;She took and she called USA Gymnastics. And this is what 
she said: ``I spoke to a woman there, and I told her that I had 
this packet of complaints against Bill McCabe. And I asked 
whether she had any complaints against him. And she said no.'' 
She said no.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Yet, if you look back on his record, you'll find that in 
October of 1996, he was fired from Gymnastics World in Fort 
Myers, Florida, because he was bragging to a colleague about 
his efforts to coerce a 15-year-old cheerleader to have sex 
with him.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;And then, in July of 1997, he was fired from Five Star 
Gymnastics in Erlanger, Kentucky, following an incident in 
which gymnasts he had taken to a camp in Pennsylvania. Parents 
had also complained that McCabe exposed his genitals to some 
gymnasts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;And then it goes on and on to tell about all these things 
before 2002 that this gentleman had done. And in fact, he had 
been fired also from another area. And they actually sent a 
packet to USA Gymnastics detailing all of these situations that 
he had been involved in. And yet, no response whatsoever.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Do you ever do background checks on any of your coaches 
like this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; First of all, let me state that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Do you ever do background checks on any of your
coaches like this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; So----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; It's a yes-or-no question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; There are background checks that are being done
currently.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Did you do background checks on him, this
sexual predator who is in jail, in prison for 30 years? Did you 
do background checks on him?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I was not there. I can't answer that question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Well, find out who was there, because I need an
answer to it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; OK?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Now, you know, it gets better, if there's such
a thing, because after he was sentenced to jail, after he was 
in prison, a civil lawsuit was filed. And for 5 years--until it 
was just recently settled out of court last month--for 5 years 
you argued that you had no responsibility to protect these 
children training under your organization?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I did not argue that. That's unacceptable. I did
not argue that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Who argued it then?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;I started in December of 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    But let me say this----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Now, you know, let me say this: This is
ridiculous.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I agree.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;And how you can work for an organization like
this that let this happen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    You know, I've sat here throughout this whole hearing, and 
there's one thing I haven't heard from any of you--from any of 
you--and that is, ``I'm sorry.'' I haven't heard from any one 
of you say to the parents, to the children, to the 
grandparents, ``I'm sorry.'' And that's despicable.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Let me answer if I can, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Answer what?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I've said I'm sorry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;If you don't want to say you're sorry, I don't
want to talk to you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    And I'm reclaiming my time, ma'am, and I'm going to tell 
you, this cannot be tolerated.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Ms. Lyons, it's my understanding that you wrote
in an email about a former USA Taekwondo athlete who sent 
information--who filed an ethics complaint--you wrote an email 
that ``this sounds like the same old BS.'' Did you write that 
in an email?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I did.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; You did? And are you currently the Acting
Director, the acting CEO of the USOC?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; You should resign your position now. That
insensitivity tells me that you are not fit to serve in that 
position.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Oh, my God.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Mr. Harper [presiding]. The gentleman's time has expired. 
Let the record----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Mr. Chairman, I'd like to take a moment of
personal privilege.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Just let me say something first.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Let the record reflect that during opening statements the 
U.S. Olympic Committee and the NGBs represented here all 
acknowledged responsibility for previous actions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    With that, I'll recognize Mr. DeGette for a point of 
personal privilege.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Mr. DeGette"&gt;Not only that, Mr. Chairman, they all
apologized to the victims, to their parents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Mr. DeGette"&gt;And furthermore, Ms. Perry, who was just relentlessly 
badgered by Mr. Carter, was brought in in December to fix this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Mr. DeGette"&gt;    Now, I hope she does fix it. But to badger her is 
inappropriate, Mr. Carter.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="579" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Ma'am, she was on the board of directors when
this happened. She was on the board when this happened.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman is no longer recognized. And
we're going to proceed with our questioning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;So at this time--yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. I believe it is important for us to clarify.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    I do not believe that Ms. Perry was on the board of 
directors, Mr. Carter. I have met with Ms. Perry after she 
began------
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Not Ms. Perry. Ms. Lyons is who I'm talking
before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. OK. But for the record, Ms. Perry, who is now 
leading USA Gymnastics, was not on the board of directors, was 
new to the organization.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Let's stay on--thank you for that
clarification.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="589" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Let's stay on track. This is an important
hearing and the process of what we're trying to do. And we're 
going to stay on message here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="590" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize Mr. Costello for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="591" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="592" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;If we could have everyone turn to Tab 20. I have a question 
for Ms. Lyons and then a question for Ms. Perry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="593" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;The memo referenced, 2012 memo in Tab 20, discuses a 
requests that NGBs provide feedback to the USOC on the 
community's reaction should the USOC insist on criminal 
background checks. Ten NGBs apparently never responded. Thirty-
five of the 37 did respond, but required some--that some form 
of background check at the time was required.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="594" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;The two most recently cited obstacles to requiring criminal 
background checks: one, costs; two, resistance from the NGB 
constituency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="595" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, how much resistance did the USOC receive from 
the NGB community on requiring background checks?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="596" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Well, I was not part of this program. I don't
know precisely.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="597" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    There was some resistance, and I think for the reasons put 
there, people were not, perhaps, putting this at the highest 
part of their priority list. And there was some pushback.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="598" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; And so the fact that the USOC did not begin
requiring NGBs to conduct background checks until 2014, 2 years 
after this memo, why was there a delay? Would your answer be 
that they didn't place a priority on it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="599" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I think the reality would be that putting in the
actual practical applications of doing the background checks 
did take some time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="600" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Any other reasons why it took 2 years?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="601" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; It takes a long time to get 49 organizations to
all consistently adhere to a new change.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="602" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Ms. Perry, USA Gymnastics practice in 2005
was to allow professional members to self-certify as to their 
criminal background. When did USAG begin to require an actual 
background check instead of the self-certification.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="603" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I don't--I'm not clear on that date. But I will
tell you right now, for the last several years USA Gymnastics 
has required background checks for hiring of professionals, and 
in addition to that has other kinds of requirements as club 
owners and others are looking to hire individuals. And one of 
those is to make sure that they consult with our public-facing 
ineligible list and our suspended list online.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="604" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Would you kindly provide an answer in writing
as to when that did------
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="605" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="606" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Mr. Costello [continuing]. Take place. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="607" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    To all NGBs, what results might show up on a background 
check that would lead your NGB to deny or terminate an 
individual's membership? Try and be brief, because I do have a 
followup on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; Any criminal activity or charges.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Any? Shoplifting?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; Anything.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;OK. Anything else?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    OK. If an individual who is already a member fails a 
routine followup background check, what action would your NGB 
take?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; So anybody with a felony or a pending felony
charge would be immediately suspended and given the opportunity 
for a hearing in front of our Ethics Committee.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; How about a misdemeanor? Would that be
overlooked or would that also prompt the same level of 
scrutiny?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; A misdemeanor is not an automatic referral to
the Ethics Committee. It would depend on the seriousness.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; It would depend upon the nature of the
misdemeanor?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Yes, it would, yes
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Any misdemeanor that involved any physical
altercation, assault, or anything of a sexual nature would 
prompt it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Yes, it would. Anything, including violence,
sexual or otherwise.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;OK. If a failing background check doesn't
lead to terminating someone's membership, what would? I don't 
like that question, because I don't think it's very clear.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    Let me ask you this. Do your policies require background 
checks on athletes in addition to coaches, employees, doctors, 
volunteers, and the like? Background checks on athletes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; USA Taekwondo doesn't require background
checks on athletes, no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; USA Swimming, no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; USA Gymnastics, no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt; USA Volleyball, no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; OK. Mr. McNally, as other NGBs began
implementing these background checks requirement, and the issue 
of sexual abuse in sports rose in prominence, especially after 
USA Swimming's 2010 revelations, why didn't USA Taekwondo act 
faster in implementing this requirement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; I'll have to supply that as an answer
following the hearing, because I wasn't there. I believe they 
were implemented in late 2013.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; And for all NGBs, how far into the past do
the background checks go?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt; USA Volleyball started in the 2004-2005 season.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="630" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; I'm not entirely sure. I believe it's as far
back as the records. If there's a felony from 2000, it will 
show up.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="631" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Yes, that was my question, Mr. Davis. The
background check on a particular individual goes back to when? 
To the date that they turn 18?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt; I'm sorry. I have to give it to you in writing
exactly on how that process works.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Very good.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt; But I believe it goes back to as far as they
turn 18, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;OK. I would kindly request of all the NGBs,
if you could provide that answer in writing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the gentleman from Florida, 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it
very much. Thanks for allowing me to sit in on the hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;This issue came to national attention because survivors 
were willing to speak up about their experiences with abuse. It 
was their bravery that shined a light on the many problems 
within the national sports organizations and how the systems 
previously in place had failed them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    For the panel, and let's start with Ms. Lyons, how are you 
involving survivors and other athletes in your decisionmaking 
process and policy changes moving forward?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We think that the voice of the athletes is
critically important in forming any of the changes that we 
make.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;I wish that many of the survivors would come and contact 
us. We actually are prevented due to some of the litigation 
from reaching out to them directly, but we would welcome their 
voices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We are setting up--we've just done a thousand-athlete 
survey, we received a thousand responses on the survey, to get 
our broader athlete population helping us to understand what 
their concerns are about SafeSport.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    We have been meeting with our Athletes' Advisory Council. 
And they will be--and other athletes of course--will be part of 
our athlete safety panel that's going to go forward and help us 
make the policy changes going forward.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Ms. Perry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;This is something that I think about every day. And one of 
the first things that I did when I became president and CEO was 
I started flying everywhere and talking to athletes, and some 
of those are survivors. And their voice is incredibly important 
to me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;And what I have found is that there is just so much love of 
this sport, but there's a desire to have an impact on the 
organization and its strategic direction. And one of the things 
that I created was an Athlete Task Force to have that happen. I 
think it's a very important first step.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Ms. Lyons talked about the advisory committee. That's 
important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    But for me it is really about getting in front of as many 
athletes as I can and making sure that their voice is heard and 
that they feel empowered. And I will tell you that that is 
something I focus on every day.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; OK. Please continue. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;Congressman, we sent out--I sent out a letter
to our membership encouraging and inviting any survivors to 
contact us for a chance to meet, and I would be happy to meet 
with them personally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;I've had the opportunity to meet with one survivor thus 
far. I've had contact with two others and plan to have two 
other meetings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt;    Aside from that, as I said previously, we need to engage 
and empower athletes to be part of our solutions going forward, 
and that will happen immediately.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Mr. McNally.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;So USA Taekwondo is one of, I believe, three
NGBs participating in the SafeSport athlete climate survey, 
which is going to reach out to a select number of athletes and 
get them involved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt;    We're also working with Fighting Spirit, which is a group 
that educates on sexual misconduct and bullying, to make sure 
that those athletes learn about this before they become 
victims.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="659" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Mr. Davis.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="660" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;We also engage our athletes and have an athlete
council that we are engaging with to be able to talk to them 
about trying to make sure that everything is made transparent 
to us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="661" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    In addition to that, we have been in constant contact with 
past victims, which were part of the reason of how we were able 
to be able to go and continue with the Mr. Butler case that we 
were able to do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="662" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Ms. Pfohl.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="663" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Yes. We actually have two athletes on our
governing board, and we are also establishing a SafeSport 
Champions Program where we will able to cut across all of the 
sports to engage survivors, as well as those that are 
passionate about preventing bullying, harassment, hazing, and 
all forms of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="664" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;OK. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="665" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Next question. These horrific events occurred for years 
without repercussions. Unacceptable, as far as I'm concerned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="666" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Given this sad reality, what changes has your organization 
made to encourage athletes to come forward with any complaints 
of abuse they have made, or they may have some complaints. What 
changes have you made to encourage them to come forward?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="667" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Let's start from here.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="668" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="669" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;I think, first and foremost, we have to make
sure that the information on how they can come forward is made 
better available. So we've made a lot of Web site and other 
communications changes so that people are aware of the Center, 
its role, and that it is a clear path to safe reporting. That's 
item one.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="670" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We also need to ensure that the athletes can, you know, 
reach out to anyone that they feel safe to discuss, and all of 
us need to make ourselves more visibly available to them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="671" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    And I think that everyone on this panel believes that those 
voices need to be heard and is trying to build the mechanisms 
in place through either councils, working groups, surveys, 
whatever it takes to get those voices better heard.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="672" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;How do we ensure that their actions, again,
the allegations, the victims' allegations are acted on quickly?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Quickly, if you could respond, because I don't have a lot 
of time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;I think that it is really a cultural change. And
that's something that I've embarked on from day one.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;And the culture has to be one where athletes feel they can 
speak up. And you accomplish that through a lot of different 
ways--through your structure, through your policies, through 
your personnel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="676" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    But nothing replaces being there in front of the athletes. 
Nothing replaces being their advocate. And as an organization, 
that is something that I've dedicated my time, and, quite 
frankly, the reason I took this job, so that they would know 
their voice not only matters, but it's going to make a 
difference in our organization going forward, a very impactful 
difference.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;OK. And it is important, again, I'm sure you
know this, that these allegations are acted on quickly so that 
we can encourage others to come forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    So, unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time, so I have to 
yield back. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The Chair will now recognize the gentlewoman from Michigan, 
Mrs. Dingell, for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="681" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mrs. Dingell. Thank you, Chairman Harper and Ranking Member 
DeGette.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="682" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you for all of you being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="683" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Like many of my colleagues, the Olympians represent 
courage, dedication, hard work, and patriotism of our young 
people, and we're not getting to talk about that today, and 
they give us reason to celebrate and to support.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="684" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;But Team USA is more than a competitive team. It's 13 
million young athletes across our country. And like my 
colleague, Mr. Walberg from Michigan, I've stood witness to the 
irresponsible, despicable, unexcusable, abusive behavior that 
has caused catastrophic damage to these young people in 
Michigan. I've met them, these young girls.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="685" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I'm sorry, I still get upset.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I'm saddened. I'm disgusted. And I think all of us here in 
a very bipartisan way want to make sure it does not happen 
again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;But what's bothering me today about this hearing, and 
what's bothered me about all of the studying that we've done to 
date, is that it's clear that the systems designed to protect 
athletes from the abusers failed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And by the way, my colleague, Mr. Walberg, was correct that 
the doctor was asked to step away, and he was very quickly back 
in the room. He was told that there should be someone in the 
room chaperoning him, and it didn't happen. And that is what is 
just so unforgivable. Or that there were no systems in place to 
begin with.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="689" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;There have been far too many incidences and allegations of 
sexual misconduct in sports, including allegations involving 
the individuals associated with each of the national governing 
bodies before us today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="690" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And honestly, I'm not reassured by your testimony, because 
I don't hear a sense of urgency. I keep hearing: Well, we're 
going to do it, we're going to get to this, we're going to do 
it. What is out there? Well, who are these young people that 
need help that aren't getting there?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;So I have some questions here. We've heard today that the 
U.S. Center for SafeSport plays a key role in protecting the 
athletes from abuse. Given how important this mission is, I 
find it deeply concerning that apparently it took 7 years for 
the U.S. Olympic Committee to get SafeSport off the ground.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;In fact, as early as 2010 the U.S. Olympic Committee 
Working Group for Safe Training Environments found that the 
Olympic Committee must do more to take a leadership role in 
protecting the athletes from abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="693" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;By the way, that's what you're all saying today, but you 
all are ``working on it.'' And I hope that as you're working on 
it, you're going to be transparent, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="694" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Ms. Perry, I'm glad that you're here today, but a lot of 
people have been wanting to hear from you since you took the 
job. You've got to be transparent with everybody.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;But by 2013, the working group had concluded that the 
authority to address SafeSport cases should be centralized with 
the new independent entity, referring to the U.S. Center for 
SafeSports.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="696" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;In 2014 SafeSport was created, but was still functionally a 
part of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Documents from that year 
indicate that this Olympics Committee board anticipated 
launching SafeSport in 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="697" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;In 2015 SafeSport still was not functioning as it was 
intended. In fact, it was not fully operational in 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="698" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, are you familiar with this timeline?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Yes, ma'am, I am.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="700" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Mrs. Dingell. Documents provided to the committee today 
suggest that a lack of funding was a major reason for the delay 
in opening SafeSport. For example, a September 2015 
presentation to the U.S. Olympic Committee board of directors 
stated that the launch of the U.S. Center for SafeSport is 
contingent on raising 5 years' worth of funding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="701" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, is it accurate that funding prevented the USOC 
from launching SafeSport sooner?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;I think the answer is there was a delay. And as
we look back, that was a mistake.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;We did hope for the Center, in order to be totally 
independent, we had hoped very much that other sports 
organizations outside of the Olympic movement would 
participate. We spent a fair amount of time trying to make that 
happen. It did not. In retrospect, of course, we should have 
funded it sooner and got it going.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Mrs. Dingell. Why should I take confidence from what you're 
saying today when you look at this timeline. And I do want to 
ask questions about--there are only 14 people working there 
now, with some outside consultants, and the volume of work has 
got me worried, too. But you keep telling me: We're working on 
it, we're setting up a study.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    Is it going to take another 5 years or what we doing to 
protect these young people right now so this never happens 
again?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="706" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Well, first, I appreciate your anger and
concern. And I share it. And I understand how frustrating it 
must seem and how incompetent it must seem that----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="707" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Mrs. Dingell. Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="708" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Ms. Lyons [continuing]. We haven't made this happen sooner. 
I will tell you that at 27 out of the last 29 board meetings, 
SafeSport was a topic of conversation. There was a steady march 
of increasing new procedures, putting those in place, getting 
all the NGBs to suddenly be required to do certain things they 
had not done before. Those things all preceded the opening of 
the Center.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="709" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;There were many new controls that were put in place that 
were progress, but not enough, albeit not enough and not fast 
enough. And if we could turn back the hands of time, as the 
chairman said, I certainly wish we could and make it move 
faster.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="710" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;Mrs. Dingell. I just hope that everybody here realizes the 
time for talk is over and you need to walk your talk.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="711" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="712" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I want to thank each of you for being here
today. We're almost done, but I do have just in response to 
some of these a little followup.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="713" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And, Ms. Perry, Dr.Burgess asked a few questions about the 
abuse that had occurred at the hands of Nassar at the Karolyi 
Ranch. And you stated you did not want the athletes to have to 
return to such an emotionally painful place where they were 
abused. And so USA Gymnastics terminated its agreement with the 
Karolyi Ranch on January 18 of this year. I believe that was 
definitely the right decision to make.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="714" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    However, USA Gymnastics was aware of allegations against 
Nassar in 2015 and made the decision to renew its contract with 
the Karolyi Ranch in spring of 2017. Why was this agreement 
renewed in April of 2017 despite knowing about his abuse, 
sexual abuse, for years?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="715" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;Chairman Harper, I can't answer that question.
It's a very important question. And, again, I think that many 
of these questions hopefully will be answered through the 
independent investigation with Ropes &amp;amp; Gray.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="716" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt;    But what I can tell you is that that and many things that 
I've done in the last 5 months have been about the athletes. 
Making sure that the ranch was closed. Making sure that we set 
up an athlete assistance fund for counseling and medical 
services. Making sure that we had an Athlete Task Force. And 
making sure they knew they had a voice with our organization 
and restructuring to make sure that we had the adequate 
SafeSport personnel to handle the kinds of volume that we have.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="717" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you, Ms. Perry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="718" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Ms. Lyons, was the U.S. Olympic Committee involved in the 
decision to renew the contract for the Karolyi Ranch in April 
of 2017?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="719" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; No. There actually are two different contracts.
The USOC had what I would call a marketing license with the 
Karolyi Ranch that allows them to be designated as a training 
site with the Olympic rings upon it. The actual lease of the 
property was a separate agreement to the USAG.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="720" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; OK. So my question was, was the USOC involved
in the decision? Was the USOC even aware of the decision to 
open it back up?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="721" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;I don't know the answer to that. I would guess
they probably would have known, at least the lease was coming 
due and that it might be under consideration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="722" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt;    We do know that they were considering buying the ranch.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="723" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And we will ask that in writing to give you an
opportunity to respond in more detail.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="724" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And then my final point is, just curious, are routine drug 
screens done on the coaches? And just yes or no from each of 
you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="725" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I'll start with you, Ms. Perry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="726" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Do you do routine--I know athletes are, you know, drug 
tested. Are the coaches? Are there drug screens done on the 
coaches?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="727" speaker="Ms. Perry"&gt; I don't know the random nature of that, but I'll
find that out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hinchey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="728" speaker="Mr. Hinchey"&gt; Not to my knowledge, but I'll find out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="729" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; I don't believe so, no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="730" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt; I don't believe so, but we'll find out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="731" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;OK. You're going to find out. But just curious,
is that a problem? Would that help? Wouldn't that be a good 
thing to probably do? And I would encourage you to do so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="732" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    And I'll recognize Ranking Member DeGette for her followup.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="733" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="734" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I just want to clarify a couple of things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="735" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;The first thing is, Ms. Lyons, Mr. Carter asked you about 
an article from The Washington Post quoting an email by you. 
And I wanted to give you the opportunity to respond to what 
your entire email was, not just what Mr. Carter was badgering 
you about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="736" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Because the Washington Post story says, quote, ``Lyons 
wrote a heated email to three other USOC execs, including the 
then-CEO Scott Blackmun.'' Quote: ``'This sounds like the same 
old BS,' she wrote.'' Quote: ``Allowing a potential sexual 
predator to continue to coach without having an appropriate 
investigation and conclusion is unacceptable,'' end quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="737" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Was that the full content of your email?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="738" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; No, there actually was more.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="739" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; There was more?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="740" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="741" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Could you provide us a copy of that email if
you still have it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="742" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; I have not been able to find it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="743" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; OK. But do you agree that you wrote those
words?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lyons&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="744" speaker="Ms. Lyons"&gt; Yes, I absolutely did.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="745" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Now, one other question. Actually, I wanted to
ask Ms. Pfohl about what Mr. McNally was talking about, which 
is that, as I understand it, Mr. McNally, you said that there 
are only certain types of misdemeanors that your organization 
investigates. It would be violent ones or sexual or something 
like that. Is that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNally&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="746" speaker="Mr. McNally"&gt; Yes, that's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="747" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;So, as a former criminal defense lawyer
myself, I will say that oftentimes more serious offenses, like 
felonies, get pled down to misdemeanors, and even misdemeanors 
that don't appear to be involving violence or sexual assault or 
things like that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="748" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    So what I wanted to ask you, Ms. Pfohl, is does your 
organization make a distinction if a complaint comes in and it 
is a misdemeanor level or a felony level? Or would you 
investigate the misdemeanor ones as well?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="749" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;Thank you, ma'am.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="750" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;What we're looking at is, did someone breach the SafeSport 
code of conduct, which is much broader than the law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="751" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt;    So we let law enforcement handle law enforcement issues, 
absolutely. Certainly, if someone has a criminal disposition 
that plays into our investigation, obviously that would be a 
breach of the SafeSport code. But what we're looking at is, did 
someone breach the SafeSport code.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="752" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; So you're looking at the conduct, not
necessarily the legal disposition.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pfohl&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="753" speaker="Ms. Pfohl"&gt; Correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="754" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;So, Mr. Chairman, I just want to make one
final statement, and that's this. I think that everybody in 
this room agrees this is a terrible tragedy that happened and 
we can't let it linger along--we can't let it drift along. The 
organization themselves, the USOC, can't let it drift along.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="755" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;We need to make sure that we actually have adequate funding 
so that the Center for SafeSport can do its job. And as of 
today, I have concerns about whether they have that amount of 
funding given the way the number of complaints has escalated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="756" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    And so I would ask if you would consider--we'll continue to 
have conversations with everybody, but if you would consider 
scheduling a followup hearing, like 6 months from now, so we 
can see if these things are actually being implemented.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="757" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I can assure you that the subcommittee will
stay on this issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="758" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you, Ms. DeGette.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="759" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;To those individuals in the room or who may be watching who 
have been victims, I want to thank you for having the courage 
to stand up and for the role that you're playing in preventing 
future cases of sexual assault. We will continue this fight on 
your behalf.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="760" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;In conclusion, I'd like to thank our witnesses and the 
Members that have participated in today's hearing. And I'll 
remind Members that they have 10 business days to submit 
questions for the record. And I would ask the witnesses to 
promptly respond to those, if you so receive those questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="761" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;With that, the subcommittee is adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="762" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;[Whereupon, at 12:46 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="763" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;[Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
</Hearing>
