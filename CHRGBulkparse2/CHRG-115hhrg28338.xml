                             Washington, DC
                              ----------                              
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:01 a.m., in 
room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Paul A. Gosar 
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Gosar, Gohmert, Lamborn, Wittman, 
Tipton, Graves, Lowenthal, Costa, Huffman, Beyer, and Soto.
    Also Present: Representatives Johnson and McEachin.
    Dr. Gosar. The Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources 
will come to order.
    The Subcommittee is meeting today to hear testimony on the 
deficiencies in the permitting process for offshore seismic 
research.
    I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Louisiana, 
Mr. Johnson, and the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. McEachin, be 
allowed to sit with the Subcommittee and participate in the 
hearing. Without objection, so ordered.
    Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at 
the hearings are limited to the Chairman, the Ranking Minority 
Member, and the Vice Chair. This will allow us to hear from our 
witnesses sooner and help Members keep to their schedules. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that all Members' opening 
statements be made part of the hearing record if they are

    &lt;option&gt;               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA
    Dr. Gosar. Today, we meet to discuss the findings of the 
December 2017 GAO report that examined the convoluted and 
politicized process for reviewing and issuing permits to 
conduct seismic surveying. From failures in the simplest of 
management tasks, such as recording start dates, to blatant, 
politically driven maneuvers, the GAO report identified poor 
practices that led to the delayed issuance of permits by over 
1,000 days.
    This hearing seeks to shed light on these findings, to 
highlight exactly what seismic surveying is, and to address 
potential solutions to ensuring these permits are issued in a 
responsible and timely manner.
    Seismic surveying itself is the safest and least intrusive 
way of imaging both underground and subsea geology. The process 
sends acoustic waves down into the earth, which then rebound 
and are subsequently received and recorded by seismophones or 
receiving phones. Essentially, this is ultrasound technology, 
as acoustic waves are used to produce an image.
    Seismic surveying data is used to identify offshore 
reservoirs with production potential. To be clear, the seismic 
surveying process is completely distinct from the National OCS 
Oil and Gas Leasing process. It is seismic data that informs 
the leasing process, specifically the decision to lease and the 
value of the assets.
    In addition to offshore oil and gas planning, the data 
collected serves a variety of purposes. For instance, seismic 
tests allow researchers to examine the movement of tectonic 
plates and to identify sand and gravel resources used to shore 
up hurricane-ravaged coastlines. Furthermore, the military 
makes extensive use of this data when planning offshore 
infrastructure or exercises. Despite these multiple uses, we 
have not conducted offshore seismic surveys in over 30 years in 
the Atlantic and Pacific, and much of the Alaskan OCS.
    To perform seismic surveys, a seismic operator must apply 
to BOEM for a geological and geophysical, or G&amp;amp;G, permit. 
Operators seeking studies on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Alaskan 
coasts also apply for an Incidental Harassment Authorization 
permit, or an IHA, from the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
NMFS, or the Fish and Wildlife Service. BOEM typically issues 
the G&amp;amp;G permits rather quickly, usually within 100 days.
    The IHAs are the real problem. They are required under the 
Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to ensure that no marine 
mammals are harassed or disturbed by any human activity. It 
should be noted that, to date, there has been no instance of 
harm or disturbance to a marine mammal from acoustic seismic 
testing. The MMPA stipulates that NMFS and the Fish and 
Wildlife Service have 120 days to review and issue an IHA. 
However, GAO found that NMFS never recorded the accurate and 
completeness date of the IHA applications.
    Without something as basic as a start date, NMFS and Fish 
and Wildlife were not able to track permitting timelines, and 
were unable to determine whether they were meeting their 
statutory obligations. The basic failure to record a start date 
threw IHA permits into uncertainty, with the agencies failing 
to meet statutory time limitations on review and issuance of 
permits. This is a completely unacceptable instance of 
regulatory failure.
    On top of all of this is the politicization of these 
permits. Under the Obama administration, there were six G&amp;amp;G 
permits that were essentially yanked from the applicants for 
purely political reasons. These permit applications were 
rejected because, under the former administration's extremely 
limited 5-year leasing plan, no leases or production could take 
place in the Atlantic.
    Thankfully, President Trump identified the unlawful 
misinterpretation of the seismic and leasing processes and 
reinstated review of these permits. Yet, these permits are 
still undergoing review, as they have for over 1,000 days at 
this point in time.
    Failure to properly process these permits, and failure to 
develop a proper path forward for future permits, keeps our 
country in the dark about our offshore resources, hindering our 
Nation's ability to make informed, long-term leasing decisions. 
Today, we examine the regulatory failures that took place as we 
seek to improve access to this invaluable seismic data.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Prepared Statement of the Hon. Paul A. Gosar, Chairman, Subcommittee on 
                      Energy and Mineral Resources
    Today, we meet to discuss the findings of the December 2017 GAO 
Report that examined the convoluted and politicized process for 
reviewing and issuing permits to conduct seismic surveying. From 
failures in the simplest of management tasks, such as recording start 
dates, to blatant, politically driven maneuvers, the GAO report 
identified poor practices that led to the delayed issuance of permits 
by over a thousand days. This hearing seeks to shed light on these 
findings, to highlight exactly what seismic surveying is, and to 
address potential solutions to ensuring these permits are issued in a 
responsible, and timely manner.
    Seismic surveying itself is the safest and least intrusive way of

seismic surveys in over 30 years in the Atlantic and Pacific, and much 
of the Alaskan OCS.
    To perform seismic surveys, a seismic operator must apply to BOEM 
for a Geological and Geophysical, or G&amp;amp;G, permit. Operators seeking 
studies on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Alaskan coasts also apply for an 
Incidental Harassment Authorization Permit, or ``IHA,'' from the 
National Marine Fisheries Service (``NMFS'') or the Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife 
Service. BOEM typically issues the G&amp;amp;G permits rather quickly, usually 
within 100 days.
    The IHAs are the real problem. They're required under the MMPA 
(Marine Mammals Protection Act) to ensure that no marine mammals are 
``harassed'' or disturbed by any human activity. It should be noted 
that, to date, there has been no instance of harm or disturbance to a 
marine mammal from acoustic seismic testing. The MMPA stipulates that 
NMFS and Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife have 120 days to review and issue an IHA. 
However, GAO found that NMFS never recorded the ``accurate and 
completeness'' date of the IHA applications. Without something as basic 
as a start date, NMFS and Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife were not able to track 
permitting timelines, and were unable to determine whether they were 
meeting their statutory obligation. The basic failure to record a start 
date threw IHA permits into uncertainty, with the agencies failing to

    Dr. Gosar. I now recognize the Ranking Member for his 
testimony.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to 
the witnesses for being here today.
    The Interior Department's just-released plan to open every 
region of the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas 
development is the latest example of the Republicans governing 
for the benefit of corporations, not citizens.
    Under the plan, the risks from offshore drilling would 
extend from coast to coast, from the shores of Maine down to 
the Florida Everglades, and from the California beaches to 
fishing and native communities in Washington State and in 
Alaska.
    In total, Secretary Zinke wants to satisfy Big Oil's 
insatiable appetite with over 1.6 billion acres of America's 
oceans, all while rolling back the safety protections developed 
in response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. But I have 
news for Secretary Zinke, Americans have zero interest in 
handing more of our oceans over to oil and gas corporations.
    Our coastlines are home to 123 million citizens, and along 
with the oceans, these resources serve as a massive economic 
engine. For example, in my home state of California, coastal 
counties account for 68 percent of the state's population and 
over 80 percent of our GDP. But now for the first time since 
1984, the Interior Department has proposed new Federal oil and 
gas leases off California's coast.
    Had the Secretary consulted California residents and 
elected officials before his decision, he would have learned 
why Federal offshore leases have not been offered in over 30 
years and why our legislature prohibited leasing in state 
waters in 1994. But since he didn't, I will enlighten him.
    In 1969, a well blowout 6 miles off the coast of Santa 
Barbara resulted in over 3 million gallons of oil gushing into 
the ocean. The spill created a 35-mile long oil slick along 
California's coast and killed thousands of fish, birds, and 
marine mammals. To date, it is the largest oil spill in the 
state's history and the third largest in our Nation's.
    A silver lining of the Santa Barbara spill is that it woke 
the environmental consciousness of many Americans, and it was 
integral to the development of today's regulatory framework 
that governs our natural resources. In 1970, the National 
Environmental Policy Act was signed into law, the Environmental 
Protection Agency was created, and Earth Day was established.
    A bipartisan California legislature banned offshore 
drilling in state waters in 1994, and between 1981 and 2008, 
the U.S. Congress prevented Federal leasing off the Pacific and 
Atlantic coasts.
    Today, Americans who live along our shores understand their 
critical importance and want the government to protect these 
resources, not risk them for another drop or two of fossil 
fuels.
    But Secretary Zinke could not care less about California's 
history or about the local voices vehemently opposed to his 
drill-everywhere plan. A few days after releasing his proposal, 
Secretary Zinke tweeted out that he met with Florida Governor 
Rick Scott, and then after just a few minutes, decided that the 
offshore leasing plan would no longer include Florida. Sadly, I 
have had trouble deciding what is more flagrantly 
inappropriate, that Governor Scott is running for Senate 
against an incumbent Democrat, that President Trump owns a 
coastal resort in Palm Beach, Florida and profits from its 
success, or that Secretary Zinke's announcement circumvents the 
process and disregards the local voices opposed to offshore 
drilling in every other coastal state.
    Secretary Zinke's reasoning that, ``Florida is unique and 
its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic 
driver,'' reveals his tweet is nothing more than a political 
ploy. I am confident my coastal colleagues and I could easily 
point to the uniqueness of our coasts, and the local businesses 
that are economically reliant upon a healthy and oil-free 
environment.
    Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter two letters into the 
record. The first is a letter from the 36 Members of our 
California Congressional Delegation to Secretary Zinke opposing 
our state's inclusion in the leasing plan. A second is from 151 
Members of the House opposing the inclusion of the Atlantic, 
Arctic, Pacific, and the East Coast regions in the leasing 
plan.
    Californians have experienced catastrophic oil spills 
before and we will do everything in our power to prevent them 
from happening again.
    I thank the witnesses for being here, and I yield back.

    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Gosar. Now I will introduce our witnesses. First, we 
have Dr. Walter Cruickshank, Acting Director of the Bureau of 
Ocean Energy Management. Did I say that right?
    Dr. Cruickshank. Yes, you did. Thank you.
    Dr. Gosar. OK. Dr. Jon Ludwigson, Acting Director of the

    Let me remind the witnesses that under Committee Rules, 
they must limit their oral statements to 5 minutes, but their 
entire statement will be entered into the record. Our 
microphones are not automatic, so you are going to have to push 
the button. You are going to see some lights there. For the 
first 4 minutes, it will be green, then it will turn yellow. 
When you see it red, we need to summarize, get caught up, 
because we will have votes here early this morning.
    And with that, now I will recognize Dr. Cruickshank for his 
testimony.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;                   OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT
    Dr. Cruickshank. Thank you, and good morning.
    Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Lowenthal, and members of 
the Subcommittee, I am pleased to be here today to discuss the 
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's oversight of geological and 
geophysical surveys on the Outer Continental Shelf. Such 
surveys support BOEM's mission to ensure the responsible 
development of conventional and renewable energy offshore, as 
well as marine mineral resources, while protecting the 
environment.
    Geological and geophysical data are critically important to 
understanding the bathymetry of the ocean floor as well as the 
vast area beneath the seabed. There are numerous technologies 
that can be employed to gather this data which are used for a 
variety of purposes, including hydrocarbon exploration and 
production, aiding in the siting of renewable energy structure 
such as offshore wind turbines, locating potential sand and 
gravel resources for coastal restoration projects, identifying 
possible seafloor or shallow geologic hazards, and locating 
potential archeological resources and hard bottom habitats that 
should be avoided. G&amp;amp;G surveys also help to advance fundamental 
scientific knowledge and are currently conducted in countries 
throughout the world.
    One common method of procuring this data is with seismic 
surveys. Those surveys use sound waves sent through the ocean 
floor to map the subsurface. Modern seismic acquisition and 
processing techniques can provide data sets that significantly 
enhance subsurface imaging, leading to improved oil and gas 
resource assessments and more informed administration of 
regulatory responsibilities.
    One of the principal environmental issues with seismic 
surveys is the potential impact of associated noise on various 
marine species. Our environmental studies program is one of the 
earliest Federal programs to sponsor research on ocean sounds 
beginning in the early 1980s. Since 1998, BOEM has partnered 
with academia and other experts to invest more than $50 million 
on protected species and noise-related research. This work has 
helped inform development of mitigation measures to protect 
marine species from potential adverse impacts of survey-related 
activity.
    On April 28 of last year, the President issued Executive 
Order 13795, entitled ``Implementing an America-First Offshore 
Energy Strategy.'' The Executive Order calls for the Secretary 
of the Interior to develop and implement, in coordination with 
the Secretary of Commerce, and to the maximum extent permitted 
by law, a streamlined permitting approach for privately-funded 
seismic data research and collection and in expeditiously 
determining the offshore energy resource potential for the 
United States.
    The Executive Order further states that the Secretary of 
the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall, to the 
maximum extent permitted by law, expedite all stages of 
consideration of incidental take authorization requests and 
seismic survey permit applications under the Outer Continental 
Shelf Land's Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
    The directive in the Executive Order for a streamlined 
permitting approach is predicated on industry and other 
stakeholder complaints of the ramifications from exceedingly 
long, unpredictable, and inconsistent processes for agencies to 
reach permitting decisions, mainly under the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act, but also to a lesser degree, under the 
Endangered Species Act.
    Over the past 6 months, BOEM and the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, both leadership and staff, have met to 
discuss possible procedural approaches and statutory or 
regulatory changes for streamlining the permitting process. 
Collectively, we are committed to creating a streamlining 
framework if it could lead to the implementation of process-
oriented solutions and guidance for administering and 
implementing the ESA and the MMPA for oil and gas activities 
generally, and G&amp;amp;G permitting, specifically.
    BOEM is committed to continuing the streamlining efforts 
with National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and continuing to communicate and coordinate 
with other stakeholders on this issue as the process moves 
forward.
    I would also like to note that we have a very strong, long-
standing working relationship with the Department of Defense on 
all aspects of the OCS program, including G&amp;amp;G permitting, and 
we look forward to continuing to work with that department as 
well.
    Finally, I would also like to acknowledge the Government 
Accountability Office's recent report titled, ``Offshore 
Seismic Surveys, Additional Guidance Needed to Help Ensure 
Timely Reviews.'' BOEM worked closely with the GAO to provide 
accurate and up-to-date information for this report, which does 
not include any recommendations for BOEM action.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you again for the opportunity to be 
here today to discuss the Bureau's efforts to execute its 
missions, to safely and responsibly reduce our dependence on 
foreign oil, and create jobs through the development of 
important energy resources. I would be happy to answer any 
questions that you or members of the Subcommittee may have.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt; Prepared Statement of Walter Cruickshank, Acting Director, Bureau of 
        Ocean Energy Management, U.S. Department of the Interior
    Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Lowenthal, and members of the 
Subcommittee, I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss the 
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) oversight of geological and 
geophysical (G&amp;amp;G) surveys on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Such 
surveys support BOEM's mission to ensure the responsible development of 
conventional and renewable offshore energy and marine mineral resources 
while protecting the environment.
                               background
    Geological and geophysical data is critically important to 
understanding the bathymetry of the ocean floor, as well as the vast 
area underneath. There are numerous technologies that can be employed 
to gather this data, which is used for a variety of purposes, including 
hydrocarbon exploration and production, aiding in siting renewable 
energy structures by characterizing the ocean floor, locating potential 
sand and gravel resources for coastal restoration projects, identifying 
possible seafloor or shallow depth geologic hazards, and locating 
potential archaeological resources and potential hard bottom habitats 
that should be avoided. One common method of procuring this data is 
with seismic surveys; those surveys use sound waves, sent through the 
ocean floor, to map the subsurface.
    BOEM scientists are experts in the use of the newer survey data to 
make more informed decisions concerning potential oil and gas lease 
sales, ensure appropriate development of OCS energy resources, and 
assure the receipt of fair market value for any leasing of public 
lands. Modern two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) 
acquisition and processing techniques can provide data sets that 
significantly enhance subsurface imaging, leading to improved oil and 
gas resource assessments and more informed administration of regulatory 
responsibilities.
    G&amp;amp;G surveys are not used exclusively for oil and gas exploration. 
Seismic surveys and geologic coring are also helpful in identifying 
sand used for restoration of our Nation's beaches and barrier islands 
following severe weather events and for protecting coasts and wetlands 
from erosion. Recent examples of BOEM's sand restoration projects 
include New Jersey, where Long Beach Island has been restored in 
response to erosion caused by Hurricane Sandy; Louisiana, where 1,100 
acres of marsh, dune, and beach habitat at Whiskey Island have been 
reconstructed; and Florida, where a final environmental assessment on a 
shoreline restoration project in Brevard County totaling over 1.7 
million cubic yards of sand was recently completed in response to 
erosion caused by Hurricane Matthew. Seismic and geologic coring 
surveys also provide information that is vital to the siting and 
development of offshore renewable energy facilities.
    G&amp;amp;G surveys also help to advance fundamental scientific knowledge 
and are currently conducted in the Gulf of Mexico and in countries 
around the world.
    One of the principle environmental issues with seismic surveys is 
the potential impact of associated noise on various marine species. Our 
environmental studies program was one of the earliest Federal pioneers 
in sponsoring research on ocean sounds beginning in the early 1980s 
such as funding a 1985 study on the effects of drilling noise on whales 
in the Beaufort Sea. Since 1998, BOEM has partnered with academia and 
other experts to invest more than $50 million on protected species and 
noise-related research. BOEM has funded, developed, and overseen 
critical studies on marine mammals, such as evaluation of seismic 
survey impacts on endangered sperm whales, and has conducted numerous 
expert stakeholder workshops to discuss what is known and to identify 
further information needs on acoustic impacts in the ocean.

                          streamlining effort
    On March 28, 2017, Executive Order 13783 entitled ``Promoting 
Energy Independence and Economic Growth'' was issued by the President. 
The Executive Order called for executive agencies to immediately review 
existing regulations that potentially burden the development or use of 
domestically produced energy resources and appropriately suspend or 
rescind those that are found unduly onerous. Additionally, on April 28, 
2017, the President issued Executive Order 13795 entitled, 
``Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy'' (April 28, 
2017). The Executive Order calls for the Secretary of the Interior to 
``develop and implement, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce 
and to the maximum extent permitted by law, a streamlined permitting 
approach for privately funded seismic data research and collection 
aimed at expeditiously determining the offshore energy resource 
potential of the United States.'' E.O. 13795 further states that ``The 
Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall, to the 
maximum extent permitted by law, expedite all stages of consideration 
of Incidental Take Authorization requests, including Incidental 
Harassment Authorizations and Letters of Authorization, and Seismic 
Survey permit applications under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 
43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq., and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. 
1361 et seq.'' To further implement this guidance, on May 1, 2017, 
Secretary of the Interior Zinke issued Secretarial Order 3350 entitled, 
``America-First Offshore Energy Strategy.''
    The directive in the Executive Order for a streamlined permitting 
approach is predicated on industry and other stakeholder complaints of 
ramifications from exceedingly long, unpredictable and inconsistent 
processes for agencies to reach permitting decisions, mainly under the 
Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) but also to a lesser degree under 
the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
    In an effort to implement this direction, a streamlining team led 
by BOEM and consisting of Department of the Interior solicitors and 
BOEM and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) staff, 
was created to address and establish ways in which to build greater 
efficiencies, predictability and consistency in implementation of the 
ESA and MMPA for BOEM and BSEE activities through a combination of 
process oriented solutions, enhanced research, and possible statutory/
regulatory approaches. Specifically, the streamlining team developed a 
set of recommendations aimed at reducing undue burdens and increasing 
decision timeline predictability, while still ensuring needed 
environmental protections are set in place. While these recommendations 
are focused on permitting for oil and gas activities, most of them also 
benefit other ocean activities, such as construction, offshore wind 
facilities, sand mining, and naval operations.
    Over the past 6 months, BOEM and the National Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS) leadership and staff have met to discuss possible 
procedural and statutory/regulatory approaches for streamlining. BOEM 
has shared specific options with NMFS for their review and input. BOEM, 
BSEE, and NMFS are committed to creating a streamlining framework that 
could lead to the implementation of process-oriented solutions and 
guidance for administering and implementing the ESA and MMPA for oil 
and gas activities and G&amp;amp;G permitting specifically. BOEM is committed 
to continue the streamlining efforts with NMFS and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and to continue to communicate and coordinate with 
other stakeholders, such as the Navy and industry, on this issue as the 
process moves forward.
                     g&amp;amp;g permitting in the atlantic
    S.O. 3350 included a directive for the expedited consideration of 
appealed, new, or resubmitted seismic permitting applications for the 
Atlantic; BOEM has resumed the evaluation of the Atlantic G&amp;amp;G permit 
applications. Five NMFS Draft Proposed Incidental Harassment 
Authorizations (IHAs) were published in the Federal Register on June 6, 
2017, starting a 30-day public comment period that was further extended 
and closed on July 21, 2017. NMFS is currently processing the Atlantic 
IHAs. In addition, BOEM is also working with NMFS to finalize the 
associated ESA Section 7 consultation covering both BOEM seismic 
permits and NMFS MMPA IHAs. This ESA Section 7 consultation is being 
treated by NMFS as a subset of the existing programmatic G&amp;amp;G 
Consultation initially completed in July 2013 and re-initiated by BOEM 
in October 2015. Once this smaller consultation is complete, it is 
BOEM's understanding that NMFS will complete the re-initiated 
Programmatic consultation.
                  g&amp;amp;g permitting in the gulf of mexico
    In the Gulf Of Mexico Region (GOMR), from 2011-2016, BOEM issued 
251 G&amp;amp;G permits (approximately 42 annually); the majority related to 
oil and gas. BOEM's overall permitting approval process takes 
approximately 60 days to complete once an application is deemed 
``complete.'' This includes conducting a NEPA analysis, associated 
environmental reviews, and consultations for ESA, Coastal Zone 
Management Act (CZMA), Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) and National Marine 
Sanctuaries Act (NMSA). A seismic survey permit covers a 1-year period.
    In addition to the above required permits and associated 
environmental reviews for seismic surveys, MMPA authorization of 
industry activity may be needed as well. Under the MMPA, ``take'' from 
harassment of marine mammals is permitted only if either an Incidental 
Harassment Authorization (IHA) or Incidental Take Regulations (ITRs) 
are in place. IHAs are usually applied for individual, one-time 
activities. IHAs are valid for 1 year. NMFS has 120 days (by statute) 
to issue an IHA, which includes a 30-day public comment period. ITRs 
can be issued to accommodate similar or multiple activities taking 
place over time, which is the case in the GOMR where multiple surveys 
occur year-in and year-out. In the GOMR, an ITR, if issued, would cover 
multiple oil and gas related G&amp;amp;G activities for a 5-year period. (ITRs 
are valid for 5 years only and then must be re-issued). Under an ITR, 
applicants (industry) seek annual Letters of Authorization (LOAs) 
pursuant to the rule. The ITR timelines are not prescribed by statute, 
but NMFS estimates a 12-18 month time frame. The ITR process includes 
two comment periods for the public, which are usually 30 and 60 days. 
There is no comment period associated with LOA issuance.
    In the GOMR, even though G&amp;amp;G permits have been issued, the process 
to issue ITRs for oil and gas related G&amp;amp;G activities has gone through 
multiple starts and stops to address evolving issues since the first 
petition was submitted in 2002. Following a BOEM/NMFS restart in 2013, 
in October 2016, BOEM petitioned on behalf of industry, and at the 
request of NMFS, to create a more efficient process for addressing 
exposures and takes to marine mammals from cumulative oil and gas 
related seismic activity in the GOM. Having a rule in place would allow 
NMFS to address impacts to marine mammals from seismic surveys 
programmatically versus survey-by-survey, which in theory, would reduce 
the workload for NMFS, allowing industry operators to receive their 
MMPA authorizations in a timely manner.
    Based on the October 2016 petition, NMFS submitted a draft proposed 
ITR to OMB for review on October 2, 2017. OMB is still reviewing the 
proposed ITR.
    In a June 2010 lawsuit, NRDC v. Jewell, filed against DOI and oil 
and gas industry representatives, several environmental conservation 
groups claimed DOI failed to prepare an environmental impact statement.
    The settlement of NRDC v. Jewell, filed in the U.S. District Court 
for the Eastern District of Louisiana, allows permits to be issued in 
the GOM pursuant to the NRDC settlement. Under the settlement, Industry 
Intervenors agreed to abide by the mitigation measures described in the 
settlement agreement, which include measures such as passive acoustic 
monitoring, time area closures, and minimum separation distances 
between surveys, among others. During the stay, Plaintiffs agreed not 
to challenge the permitted surveys that abide by the above mitigation 
measures. Under the settlement agreement and stay, permits in the GOM 
are not conditioned on the applicant processing/obtaining an IHA.
    Outside of the NRDC Settlement Agreement, BOEM includes (and has 
included in the past) a suite of mitigation measures for G&amp;amp;G permits as 
they relate to marine mammals. These measures provide protection to 
marine mammals by requiring G&amp;amp;G operations to avoid and minimize 
impacts to and take of marine mammals.
                       gao seismic survey report
    Last, the Government Accountability Office recently published a 
Report titled: OFFSHORE SEISMIC SURVEYS: Additional Guidance Needed to 
Help Ensure Timely Reviews (GAO-18-60: Published: Dec 11, 2017. 
Publicly Released: Jan 4, 2018). BOEM worked closely with the GAO 
investigators and authors to provide accurate and up-to-date 
information for this report. The report did not implicate BOEM nor did 
it make any recommendations for BOEM action.
                               conclusion
    Mr. Chairman, thank you again for the opportunity to be here today 
to discuss the Bureau's effort to execute its missions to safely and 
responsibly reduce our dependence on foreign oil and create jobs 
through the development of important energy resources. I am happy to 
answer any questions that you or members of the Subcommittee may have.
                                 ______
 Questions Submitted for the Record to Dr. Walter Cruickshank, Acting 
              Director, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
Dr. Cruickshank did not submit responses to the Committee by the 
appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record.
                  Questions Submitted by Rep. Barragan
    Question 1. Early last week, Associate Deputy Secretary James Cason 
briefed our staff about Secretary Zinke's reorganization plan for DOI 
and mentioned recombining BOEM and BSEE. He stated that the staff of 
the two agencies were currently analyzing the pros and cons of 
recombination.
    1a. Is that correct, and if so, what is the status of that 
analysis?
    1b. When do you expect to have that analysis completed, or when 
have you been instructed to have that analysis completed by?
    1c. Has the Department estimated the amount of time and money 
required to recombine them?
    Question 2. Late last month, William K. Reilly, co-chairman of the 
national Oil Spill Commission formed after the Deepwater Horizon 
disaster and EPA administrator during the term of President George H.W. 
Bush, weighed in with his thoughts on the proposed recombination. He 
said, ``If you have one part of your operation bringing in $18 billion 
dollars a year and another part that does inspections, what part would 
you pay attention to? It is very unwise to mix those two under one 
head.'' \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2017/12/
feds_say_offshore_oil_rule_cha.html.
    2a. Considering that even the spokeswoman for the National Ocean 
Industries Association admitted that, ``we did not ask for it"--
referencing the recombination--and that industry lobbyists are 
concerned that it will ultimately distract agency staff, who was 
responsible for calling for this review in the first place? \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/25/oil-and-gas-allies-
want-trump-to-slow-down-242008.
    Question 3. You have been a career Interior Department employee for 
many years, and you worked at the agency both before and after the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deepwater Horizon disaster.
    3a. Do you believe that recombining BOEM and BSEE is the most 
efficient use of taxpayer dollars and--more importantly--will doing so 
increase the human and environmental safety of offshore oil and gas 
operations?
    Question 4. Can you briefly mention why the Minerals Management 
Service was reorganized in 2010 and 2011, how the split was made, and 
the amount of time and money that was required to fully separate the 
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and 
Environmental Enforcement? Was it a simple process that occurred 
quickly?
                 Questions Submitted by Rep. Lowenthal
    Question 1. Dr. Cruickshank, during the Subcommittee hearing, you 
agreed to provide a variety of documents relating to the development of 
the Draft Proposed Program CDPP) and the subsequent decision of the 
Secretary to announce that he was removing Florida from the DPP. As 
such, please provide:
    1a. Copies of any correspondence that exists between employees of 
the Department of the Interior and anyone in the Florida Governor's 
Office regarding the potential inclusion of waters around Florida in 
the Draft Proposed Plan.
    1b. Copies of any correspondence that exists between the Bureau of 
Ocean Energy Management and the Florida Governor's Office after 
publication of the Draft Proposed Program and before the Secretary's 
meeting with the Governor on January 9.
    1c. Copies of any correspondence that exists between the 
Secretary's Office, Deputy Secretary's Office, or Office of the 
Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management and the Florida 
Governor's Office after publication of the Draft Proposed Program and 
before the Secretary's meeting with the Governor on January 9.
    1d. Copies of any correspondence that exists related to discussions 
between the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Secretary, the 
Deputy Secretary, the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals 
Management, or anyone in their offices, regarding the Secretary's 
decision to tweet on January 9 that Florida would be removed from 
consideration for offshore oil and gas leasing.
    1e. Copies of any instructions sent to the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management from any other officials in the Department of the Interior 
regarding how they should treat the waters around Florida in developing 
the next step of the offshore leasing program.
    Question 2. Mr. Cruickshank, the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
creates a mechanism for the incidental take of ``small numbers'' of 
marine mammals. Can you explain why the ``small numbers'' requirement 
is a constraint on the ability to issue seismic permits?
    Question 3. As noted by Mr. Steen in his testimony, the seismic 
permits for the Atlantic Ocean were initially submitted in 2014. 
Following removal of the Atlantic from the 2017-2022 Five-Year Program 
and due to the significant concern for negative impacts on marine life, 
the seismic permits were denied in January 2017. In fact, the prior 
Director of BOEM stated: ``In the present circumstances and guided by 
an abundance of caution, we believe that the value of obtaining the 
geophysical and geological information from new airgun seismic surveys 
in the Atlantic does not outweigh the potential risks of those surveys' 
acoustic pulse impacts on marine life.''
    3a. Is it not unusual to simply pick up review of these seismic 
permits where things left off in the review process?
    3b. Shouldn't both BOEM and the Fisheries Services have required 
applicants to resubmit new applications incorporating the best 
scientific information available when this issue was reopened 5 months 
later in May 2017 (i.e., 3 years after the applications were originally 
submitted)?
    Question 4. Mr. Cruickshank, scientific studies in the last few 
years have found that seismic airgun surveys can cause undue harm to 
marine life. Research shows that seismic airguns negatively impact many 
marine species, including whales, fish, lobsters, scallops, oysters and 
even zooplankton--the very foundation of the marine food-chain.
    4a. Are you aware of these scientific studies?
    4b. Are you willing to allow undue harm to these marine species for 
the sake of oil and gas exploration and drilling in the Atlantic--an 
area where the coastal states and their constituents are clearly 
opposed to it?
    Question 5. The state of North Carolina recently requested a 
supplemental consistency certification under the Federal Coastal Zone 
Management Act for all companies proposing to conduct seismic blasting 
off the state's coast. Their request was based on significant new 
information regarding the detrimental impact of seismic blasting on 
fish, zooplankton, and other marine life. The commercial and 
recreational fishing industries support 22,500 jobs, $787 million in 
income, and contribute almost $2 billion in business sales annually to 
the state's economy.
    5a. Can you assure me that BOEM will consider this objection and 
adequately respond to it before granting permits for seismic blasting?
    5b. Can you assure me that BOEM will support the state's request, 
and to await the conclusion of any consistency review, including 
resolution of any state objections to consistency, before granting 
permits for seismic blasting?
                                 ______
    Dr. Gosar. Thank you, Dr. Cruickshank.
    I now acknowledge Mr. Ludwigson for his testimony.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;                     ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
    Mr. Ludwigson. Thank you.
    Thank you, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Lowenthal, and 
members of the Subcommittee. I am pleased to be here today to 
discuss Federal oversight of offshore seismic surveys.
    Earlier this month, as was mentioned, we released a report 
on offshore seismic surveys based on work requested by the Full 
Committee. I will summarize that report, but I ask that the 
report be entered into the record.
    My statement today will provide information on three 
topics. First, the review process and time frames for seismic 
survey applications in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and the 
Atlantic regions from 2011 through 2016. Second, the review 
process and time frames for incidental take applications over 
the same period. And finally, basic information about six 
applications in the Atlantic region.
    By way of background, offshore oil and natural gas are 
important sources of energy and revenue in the United States, 
comprising about 18 percent of national oil production and 
about 4 percent of natural gas production. They also provided 
$2.8 billion in revenue to the Federal Government in Fiscal 
Year 2016.
    Development of these offshore oil and gas resources is 
complex, relying on private companies to understand the geology 
through use of tools, such as seismic surveys, under 
authorizations obtained from Federal agencies. Entities seeking 
to conduct seismic surveys in the Outer Continental Shelf must 
generally obtain a permit from Interior's Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management, which I will refer to in my statement as 
BOEM.
    Because seismic surveys may disturb or injure marine 
mammals, referred to as a taking, entities seeking to conduct 
them may also need to obtain an incidental take authorization 
under the Marine Mammal Protection Act from Commerce's National 
Marine Fisheries Service or Interior's Fish and Wildlife 
Service.
    Regarding BOEM's process and time frames for reviewing 
seismic survey applications, we found key differences. In terms 
of process, BOEM is not required to issue permits within a 
specific time frame, and the agency reviews, once it determines 
the application is complete. We found that BOEM reviewed 297 
applications and issued 264 permits between 2011 and 2016, and 
the time frames varied.
    For example, BOEM issued 250 permits for the Gulf of 
Mexico, about 95 percent of its total, in a time frame ranging 
from the same day the application was deemed complete to 287 
days after that date. Of the 250 permits in the Gulf, 218 were 
issued within 100 days.
    Regarding review of incidental take applications, we found 
the agencies did not have accurate information, and as a 
result, we could not document how long these reviews took. 
Marine Fisheries and Fish and Wildlife follow a similar process 
requiring complete applications before beginning formal 
processing. In the Gulf of Mexico region, BOEM has generally 
issued seismic survey permits without requiring incidental take 
authorizations.
    In total, Marine Fisheries and Fish and Wildlife reviewed 
35 applications and approved 28 between 2011 and 2016. We found 
that Fish and Wildlife did not record the date the application 
was complete, and Marine Fisheries could not provide accurate 
dates because it lacked guidance on documenting the date. By 
law, the agencies are to review one type of incidental take 
authorization application, referred to as an Incidental 
Harassment Authorization, within 120 days.
    Without knowing when these applications were complete, 
Marine Fisheries and Fish and Wildlife cannot determine how 
long the reviews take and whether they are completed within the 
statutory time frame. In addition, it is not clear how much 
time private companies should build into their exploration 
plans.
    During the course of our work, we also identified six 
pending applications to conduct seismic surveys in the Atlantic 
region. We have detailed the specific circumstances of these 
applications in our report, but in summary, these applications 
were filed in 2014, denied in January 2016, and are now being 
reconsidered.
    In conclusion, offshore seismic surveys provide Federal 
agencies and private companies with a wide range of useful 
information. We found that BOEM has information on applications 
it reviews, but Marine Fisheries and Fish and Wildlife lack key 
information. Without this information, the agencies cannot 
accurately evaluate the timeliness of their reviews. In our 
report, we made four recommendations to those agencies for 
improving this process and examining whether they are meeting 
their statutory review time frames.
    Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Lowenthal, this concludes my 
statement. I would be happy to answer any questions you may 
have.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Prepared Statement of Jon Ludwigson, Acting Director, Natural Resources 
         and Environment, U.S. Government Accountability Office
    Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Lowenthal, and members of the 
Subcommittee: I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent 
report on the Federal offshore seismic permitting process.\1\ As you 
know, offshore oil and natural gas are important sources of energy and 
revenue for the United States--constituting about 18 percent of our 
Nation's total oil production and about 4 percent of our total gas 
production, and providing the Federal Government with about $2.8 
billion in revenue in Fiscal Year 2016.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ GAO, Offshore Seismic Surveys: Additional Guidance Needed to 
Help Ensure Timely Reviews, GAO-18-60 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 11, 
2017).
  Federal agencies and private companies use information about 
potential oil, gas, and other resources in the Outer Continental Shelf 
(OCS) to make regulatory, funding, and development decisions, 
respectively.\2\ Oil and gas companies conduct offshore seismic surveys 
in the OCS to collect data on the geology that may indicate the 
presence of hydrocarbons--such as oil and gas. Seismic surveys--which 
can be conducted onshore and offshore--use mechanically generated sound 
waves from an acoustic source to transmit energy into the subsurface of 
the ocean floor. Various other entities, including the National Science 
Foundation, use offshore seismic surveys for other purposes, such as to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
identify possible earthquake fault zones.
    \2\ The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) is outside the territorial 
jurisdiction of all 50 states but within the jurisdiction and control 
of the U.S. Federal Government, and consists of submerged Federal 
lands, generally extending seaward between 3 geographical miles and 200 
nautical miles off the U.S. coastline. The Department of the Interior 
has oversight over 1.7 billion acres of submerged lands in the OCS. 
There are four OCS regions in the United States: the Alaska, Atlantic, 
Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific regions. Companies that develop and produce 
oil and gas from Federal waters do so over a specified period of time 
under leases obtained from and administered by the Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management.
    Entities seeking to conduct geological and geophysical surveys, 
including seismic surveys, to identify oil, gas, and other mineral 
resources in the OCS must obtain a permit from the Department of the 
Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)--the Federal agency 
responsible for the oversight of most offshore oil and gas leasing and 
exploration activities. Given the possibility that seismic surveys may 
disturb or injure marine mammals, referred to as ``taking'' marine 
mammals, entities may obtain an incidental take authorization to avoid 
potential liability for takes of a marine mammal. Incidental take 
authorizations are issued under the Marine Mammal Protection Act by the 
Department of Commerce's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) or 
Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), depending on the species 
that might be affected.\3\ To authorize the taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals, NMFS and FWS must make certain findings as to the 
impacts of the activities, based on the best scientific evidence 
available. Several industry stakeholders and a research organization 
that applied for incidental take authorizations have raised questions 
about the timeliness of the Federal seismic survey permitting process 
and incidental take authorization application reviews.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Pub. L. No. 92-522, Sec. 101, 86 Stat. 1027, 1029 (1972) 
(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1371).
    My testimony today discusses the key findings from our December 
2017 report on the Federal offshore seismic permitting process. 
Accordingly, this testimony examines (1) BOEM's review process, the 
number of permit applications reviewed from 2011 through 2016, and its 
review time frames; (2) NMFS's and FWS's review process, the number of 
incidental take authorization applications reviewed from 2011 through 
2016, and their review time frames; and (3) the status of pending 
seismic survey permit applications and related incidental take 
authorization applications in the Atlantic OCS region. In addition, I 
will highlight several key actions that we recommended in our report 
that NMFS and FWS can take to address challenges associated with their 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
review processes.
    To conduct the work for our December 2017 report, among other 
things, we analyzed relevant laws and regulations that govern the 
review processes, reviewed and analyzed agency guidance, and 
interviewed BOEM, NMFS, and FWS agency officials. In addition, we 
identified and interviewed knowledgeable stakeholders selected to 
reflect a range of industry groups, a research institution, and 
environmental organizations to obtain their views on the seismic survey 
permitting and incidental take authorization application processes.\4\ 
In our preliminary work on all four OCS regions, we determined there 
had been no new oil and gas related seismic activity in the Pacific OCS 
region in the last two decades; as a result, we excluded the Pacific 
OCS from our review. We also obtained data from BOEM, NMFS, and FWS on 
the number of permit and incidental take authorization applications 
each agency reviewed and the number of permits and authorizations the 
agencies issued in each of the three selected OCS regions.\5\ We 
focused our review of pending applications on the Atlantic region 
because it was the only region that had applications pending at the 
time of our review. Our December 2017 report includes a detailed 
explanation of the methods used in our work. We conducted the work on 
which this testimony is based in accordance with generally accepted 
government auditing standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ Because this was a nonprobability sample of stakeholders, their 
views are not generalizable beyond those groups but provide 
illustrative examples of the views of such stakeholders.
    \5\ To assess the reliability of the data, we used publicly 
available information on the number of permit and authorization 
applications to check the data provided by BOEM, NMFS, and FWS. We 
found the data on the number of permits and authorizations to be 
sufficiently reliable for our purposes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
              BOEM's Review Process Differs by OCS Region
    As we stated in our December 2017 report,\6\ BOEM has a documented 
process for reviewing seismic survey applications in each of the three 
selected OCS regions that differs in one part depending on the region. 
In the Atlantic region, prior to issuing a permit, BOEM intends to 
require incidental take authorizations related to the seismic survey 
activities proposed in the permit application to be in place before 
issuing permits, but in the Alaska region, BOEM issues conditional 
permits while waiting for incidental take authorizations. In the Gulf 
of Mexico region, BOEM has generally issued permits without requiring 
incidental take authorizations to be in place, although it is working 
to address some aspects of its process in response to a recent 
settlement agreement.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ GAO-18-60.
    \7\ Specifically, in response to the settlement agreement, BOEM 
agreed to consider prescribing additional mitigation measures as 
conditions of approval for seismic survey permits during the stay and 
issued a final programmatic environmental impact statement in August 
2017. BOEM also submitted a revised request to NMFS for incidental take 
regulations governing geophysical surveys in the Gulf of Mexico, which 
is pending as of January 2018.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Based on our review of agency data, from 2011 through 2016, BOEM 
reviewed 297 applications for seismic survey permits. Of the 297 
seismic survey permit applications reviewed, BOEM issued 264 permits 
during this period, and the number of applications reviewed and permits 
issued varied by OCS region (see Table 1).

                    APPLICATIONS REVIEWED AND ISSUED BY THREE OUTER

GAO-18-342T
    Note: This table includes seismic survey permits for high-
resolution seismic surveys, deep-penetration seismic surveys, and 
vertical seismic profile surveys. The six permits issued in the 
Atlantic region were for high-resolution seismic surveys for non-oil 
and gas mineral resources and, according to Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management officials, did not include the use of airguns. This table 
does not include the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf region because, 
from 2011 through 2016, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not 
receive applications for or issue any seismic survey permits in that 
region. BOEM issued a permit for the pending application in the Gulf of 
Mexico region in April 2017. This table does not include Notices of 
Scientific Research, of which there were 2 in the Atlantic region, 13 
in the Gulf of Mexico, and none in Alaska during this period. The 
Notices of Scientific Research do not result in a permit.
    BOEM does not have statutory review time frame requirements for 
issuing geological and geophysical seismic survey permits. The range of 
BOEM's review time frames--from the date the agency determined that an 
application was complete to when BOEM issued a seismic survey permit--
varied by OCS region (see Fig. 1).

GAO-18-342T
    Note: The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management records the date it 
determines an application is complete, or ``accepted,'' following the 
resolution of any missing information from the applicant in the initial 
application, and the date it issues or denies the permit. This figure 
does not include the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf region because the 
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not issue any seismic survey 
permits there from 2011 through 2016. The six permits issued in the 
Atlantic region were for high-resolution seismic surveys for non-oil 
and gas mineral resources.
  Neither NMFS nor FWS Guidance Sufficiently Describes How to Record 
                          Certain Review Dates
    As we stated in our report,\8\ NMFS and FWS follow a similar 
process for reviewing incidental take authorization applications 
related to seismic survey activities. From 2011 through 2016, NMFS and 
FWS reviewed 35 and approved 28 such applications across the three OCS 
regions we reviewed, including some authorizations related to BOEM 
permits as well as research seismic surveys not associated with BOEM 
permits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ GAO-18-60.
    However, neither NMFS nor FWS guidance sufficiently describes how 
to record certain review dates. As a result, NMFS was unable to provide 
accurate dates for when the agency determined an application was 
adequate and complete--and FWS does not record this date.\9\ For 
example, based on our review of NMFS data, in at least two cases, the 
date NMFS recorded the application had been determined adequate and 
complete was after the date the proposed authorization was published in 
the Federal Register.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ NMFS and FWS begin formal processing of an incidental 
harassment authorization application--one type of incidental take 
authorization application--once it is deemed adequate and complete. See 
50 CFR Sec. Sec. 18.27(d), 216.104. See also U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, ``Marine Mammal Protection Act Incidental Harassment 
Authorizations,'' chap. 036 FW 2 in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
Manual (June 6, 2016), accessed January 11, 2018, https://www.fws.gov/
policy/036fw2.html; National Marine Fisheries Service, ``Incidental 
Take Authorizations Under the MMPA,'' accessed January 11, 2018, http:/
/www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/permits/incidental/.
    Because the agencies either do not record the date the application 
is deemed adequate and complete or do not record the date consistently, 
the agencies are not able to determine how long their formal processing 
takes. As a result, in our December 2017 report, we recommended that 
the agencies should develop guidance that clarifies how and when staff 
should record the date on which the agency determines the ``adequacy 
and completeness'' of an incidental take authorization application.\10\ 
NMFS agreed with our recommendation. FWS partially concurred with the 
recommendation, noting that it plans to develop guidance for recording 
the ``adequate and complete'' date of incidental harassment 
authorization applications; however, it did not indicate that it would 
develop such guidance for the other type of incidental take 
authorization--the incidental take regulations. As we stated in the 
report, we believe that FWS should develop guidance for both. Such 
guidance is necessary to maintain consistency with Federal internal 
control standards, which call for management to use quality information 
to achieve agency objectives and design control activities, such as 
accurate and timely recording of transactions, to achieve objectives 
and respond to risk.

    Further, under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the agencies are 
to issue one type of incidental take authorization--incidental 
harassment authorizations--within 120 days of receiving an application. 
NMFS and FWS have not conducted an analysis of their review time 
frames. As a result, in our December 2017 report, we recommended that 
both agencies should analyze their time frames for reviewing incidental 
harassment authorization applications--from the date the agency 
determines that an application is adequate and complete until the date 
an application is approved or denied--and compare the agency's review 
time frames to the statutory review time frame.\11\ Both NMFS and FWS 
agreed with our recommendation.

  BOEM and NMFS Have Been Reviewing Certain Seismic Survey Permit and 
  Incidental Take Authorization Applications in the Atlantic OCS for

    As we stated in our December 2017 report,\12\ as of October 2017, 
in addition to the six permits BOEM issued in the Atlantic OCS from 
2011 through 2016, another seven permits were pending a decision. Of 
these seven, BOEM received six applications for deep penetration 
seismic survey permits in the Atlantic region from March to May 2014 
(see Fig. 2).

    Note: Five of the six applicants submitted their related 
incidental-harassment applications to the Department of Commerce's 
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) from August 2014 through 
January 2016. According to BOEM officials, the agency was awaiting 
NMFS's issuance of incidental harassment authorizations before issuing 
seismic survey permits. Before such authorizations were issued, in 
January 2017, BOEM denied these applications, citing, among other 
things, the 5-year leasing plan, which removed the area from all 
leasing during the period from 2017 through 2022.
    Of the six applicants that applied to BOEM during that time, five 
also applied to NMFS for incidental harassment authorizations related 
to their seismic survey permit applications, from August 2014 to 
January 2016 (see Fig. 3). The sixth applicant that applied to BOEM for 
a seismic survey permit in the Atlantic OCS region did not apply for an 
incidental harassment authorization with NMFS, according to NMFS

    Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Lowenthal, and members of the 
Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased 
to answer any questions that you may have at this time.
                                 ______
    Dr. Gosar. Thank you, Mr. Ludwigson.
    I now recognize Senator Davis for his testimony.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;                      CAROLINA LEGISLATURE
    Mr. Davis. Good morning, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member 
Lowenthal, and honorable Committee members. I greatly 
appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today about 
the importance of protecting the Atlantic Coast from offshore 
drilling and seismic airgun blasting.
    My testimony today will cover the impacts of seismic 
testing and offshore drilling, the lack of jurisdiction for 
changing the permitting process, the legal and transparency 
problems associated with seismic airgun blasting, the 
significant economic impacts offshore drilling and seismic 
testing would bring to our coast, and the large bipartisan 
opposition to offshore drilling and seismic airgun blasting.
    Seismic testing involves firing loud sonic guns into the 
ocean floor every 16 seconds to read echoes from the bottom 
geology, with a test taking place over miles of ocean for 
months at a time. Scientists agree that seismic airgun blasts 
could alter the marine animals' behavior, affecting their 
migration patterns, mating habits, and how they communicate 
with each other. Most animals in the ocean use sound the way 
animals on land use eyesight. Saturating their environment with 
noise will have an impact.
    NOAA estimates that 138,000 marine animals could be injured 
and 13.6 million could have their migration, feeding, or other 
behavioral patterns disrupted. I have cited numerous scientific 
studies, which are footnoted in my testimony, as substance for 
those particular effects on marine animals.
    Accidents occur in a world where human error or mechanical 
imperfections and coastal hurricanes all play unexpected roles. 
When you drill, you spill. It is inevitable. The oil industry 
touts a 99 percent safety record, but that 1 percent is pretty 
horrific for people living in the vicinity of a spill when it 
occurs.
    The Federal Government predicts at least one spill a year 
for every 1,000 barrels in the Gulf of Mexico over the next 40 
years, a spill of 10,000 barrels or more every 3 or 4 years. We 
saw what happened in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 when the BP 
Deepwater Horizon rig spilled millions of barrels of oil into 
the Gulf. It was a disaster. But thankfully, the Gulf's bowl-
like shape contained the spill in that region.
    A similar spill off the Atlantic Coast would be a disaster 
of epic proportions. If oil entered into the Gulf stream, it 
would be forced into the Chesapeake Bay, the Hudson River 
Valley, the Gulf of Maine, and the Grand Banks, some of the 
richest fishing grounds in the world.
    The Gulf of Mexico BP Deepwater Horizon blowout also showed 
that oil cannot be removed from salt marshes and other wetland 
systems. Coastal salt marshes in South Carolina are among the 
most productive ecosystems in the world and nursery grounds for 
many estuarine and marine species. Toxic substances from oil 
spills, both chronic and acute, will put all these organisms at 
risk.
    Even if a spill never occurs, and both the oil industry and 
the Federal Government admit that spills are inevitable, there 
is still an adverse impact to South Carolina's coast in that 
the land-based infrastructure necessary to support offshore 
drilling is dirty and highly industrial. Moreover, even the 
most lucrative oil and gas scenario generates less than 1 
percent of the economic impact of what tourism has in South 
Carolina, $2.7 billion accrue in South Carolina over a two-
decade period. We realized $20 billion in tourism in the year 
2015 alone.
    I also want to point this out: along the Gulf Coast, 
beachgoers are provided with wipes to clean the oil and tar 
balls from their feet after walking on the beach. To the 
residents of South Carolina, that scenario is unacceptable, as 
our beaches are major revenue generators and part of our way of 
life.
    Also, the DoD has admitted, or has stated, that there are 
mission compatibility inconsistencies with offshore leasing. We 
have considerable military installations in South Carolina, and 
the Department of Defense concerns in this regard must be 
noted.
    It was pointed out earlier that Secretary Zinke has already 
exempted Florida from the exploration and drilling. That raises 
serious due process, equal protection concerns, and arbitrary 
and capricious standards, which I will be happy to talk about 
in follow-up questions.
    In closing, I would say the opposition is bipartisan and 
wide-ranging. More than 160 municipalities along the East Coast 
have passed resolutions opposing offshore oil and gas drilling 
and exploration. In addition, the New England, Mid-Atlantic, 
and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils for the 
Department of Defense, Air Force, and NASA have all weighed in 
to express concerns. More than 42,000 businesses and 500,000 
fishing families have also joined this overwhelming chorus of 
voices that have said no to testing or drilling.
    Seismic testing and oil drilling pose unknown threats to 
our coast and could include devastating damage to our beach 
communities and the water quality we enjoy. Oil and water 
should not mix, and now is the time of choosing. We must pick 
one or the other. Coastal communities and local voices have 
already voiced their choice. We want to protect our water, our 
coast, and our way of life from the unacceptable and 
devastating impacts of seismic testing and offshore drilling. 
Washington, please, needs to listen.
    I thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I 
look forward to answering your questions.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;   Prepared Statement of the Hon. Tom Davis, State Senator of South 
                                Carolina
    Good morning, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Lowenthal, and 
honorable Committee members. My name is Tom Davis, and I am a 
Republican State Senator from Beaufort, South Carolina. I greatly 
appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today about the 
importance of protecting the Atlantic Coast from offshore drilling and 
seismic airgun blasting. My testimony today will cover the impacts of 
seismic testing and offshore drilling, the lack of justification for 
changing the permitting process, the legal and transparency problems 
associated with seismic airgun blasting, the significant economic 
impacts offshore drilling and seismic testing would bring to our coast, 
and the large, bipartisan opposition to offshore drilling and seismic 
airgun blasting.
                       impact of seismic testing
    Seismic testing involves firing loud sonic guns into the ocean 
floor every 16 seconds to read echoes from the bottom geology, with the 
tests taking place over miles of ocean for months at a time. The 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirms that 
the sound from the seismic airguns can be recorded from sites more than 
1,860 miles away, equivalent to the distance from Washington, DC to Las 
Vegas.
    Scientists agree that seismic airgun blasts could alter marine 
mammals' behavior, affecting their migration patterns, mating habits 
and how they communicate with each other. Most animals in the ocean use 
sound the way animals on land use eyesight; saturating their 
environment with noise will have an impact. NOAA estimates that 138,000 
marine animals could be injured, and 13.6 million could have their 
migration, feeding, or other behavioral patterns disrupted.
    Proponents of seismic airgun blasting often mischaracterize an old 
quote from Dr. Bill Brown of BOEM, claiming that seismic airgun 
blasting has no impact on marine mammal populations--populations being 
the key qualifier. However, there is a substantial body of peer-
reviewed science showing that seismic airgun blasting negatively 
affects marine mammals, potentially even at the population level. For 
example, whales exposed to seismic airgun noise stop producing 
vocalizations that are essential to feeding, avoiding predators, 
breeding, and raising their young. In the baleen whales, these impacts 
can occur across vast distances, as much as 100,000 square kilometers 
or more around a single seismic array. Recent science shows that there 
are population level impacts.\1\

impacts to marine life. These include a 2017 study documenting seismic 
airgun blasting killing zooplankton up to three-quarters of a mile 
away; \2\ a 2017 study documenting seismic airgun blasting causing mass

blasting increases stress levels, which according to the study, causes 
the oysters to stop feeding and breathing; \4\ a 2017 study documenting 
seismic airgun blasting decreasing the white blood cell counts in spiny 
lobsters, leading to higher rates of immune infections; \5\ a study 
documenting seismic airgun blasting depressing longline cod and haddock

decline in reef-fish abundance after seismic airgun blasting was 
conducted in the area.\7\

                    gao study of seismic permitting
    The new study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that is 
the topic of this hearing does not, in fact, identify any significant 
deficiencies in the permitting process for offshore seismic surveys. 
The GAO conducted an extensive review, and its expert reviewers do not 
propose any of the drastic changes that were included in H.R. 3133, 
legislation that recently passed this Committee. H.R. 3133 would 
eviscerate the balanced process for issuing Incidental Harassment 
Authorizations (IHAs) in order to fast-track seismic airgun surveys and 
other industrial actions in the ocean that can harm whales, dolphins, 
and other marine mammals.
    The GAO reviewers' recommendations are minor. They recommend that 
the two agencies that issue Incidental Harassment Authorizations, the 
National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service, 
develop guidance on when and how staff should record the date on which 
the agency determines the ``adequacy and completeness'' of the 
application. Then the agencies should analyze their time frames for 
reviewing IHAs and compare them to the statutory time frames. These are 
trivial process recommendations and do not provide justification for 
wholesale changes that undermine important and necessary protections 
for marine mammals.
    Furthermore, since 2006, the Fisheries Service issued 25 out of 26 
IHAs for offshore oil and gas activities involving seismic surveys 
within its own 6- to 9-month target time frame.\8\ While four IHAs 
exceeded the time frame from the original submission date, only one 
exceeded the time frame from the date of final revisions to the 
application. In these four cases, the additional time was minimal--1 to 
3 months.\9\ For the four Letters of Authorizations, two were issued in 
the 12- to 18-month time frame, one took 24 months, and the time frame 
for one is unclear.\10\ The applicants are often the source of delay. 
If the applicants do not provide enough information, the Fisheries 
Service must return the application for revisions and addendums.\11\ 
The MMPA statutory standards are neither ambiguous nor the source of 
the alleged delay.

   results of seismic tests would be proprietary to private companies
    Proponents for testing and drilling often argue that seismic tests 
are necessary in order to provide coastal communities with data about 
oil and gas deposits off their shores to assess whether it makes 
economic sense to move forward with drilling for those resources. But 
that information is considered proprietary by the private companies 
conducting them. Local decision makers won't have access to it, nor 
will the public. Not even Members of Congress can get their hands on 
it.
    Currently, there are five companies awaiting final permits from the 
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to conduct seismic testing 
along the Atlantic Coast. Most of these companies are European and will 
not be investing in our communities. In fact, Reuters reported that a 
French-based company, CGG, is dependent on the Atlantic contract to 
avoid bankruptcy.\12\ Therefore, BOEM is literally putting French 
business interests ahead of hard-working American workers who are 
dependent on healthy ocean ecosystems for survival.

                    damages associated with drilling
    Accidents happen in a world where human error, mechanical 
imperfections and coastal hurricanes all play unexpected roles. When 
you drill, you spill. It is inevitable. The oil industry touts a 99 
percent safety record, but that 1 percent is pretty horrific for people 
living in the vicinity of a spill when it occurs. The Federal 
Government predicts at least one oil spill a year for every 1,000 
barrels in the Gulf of Mexico over the next 40 years--a spill of 10,000 
barrels or more every 3 to 4 years.
    We saw what happened in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 when the BP 
Deepwater Horizon rig spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf. 
It was a disaster, but thankfully the Gulf's bowl-like shape contained 
the spill in that region. A similar spill off the Atlantic Coast would 
be a disaster of epic proportions. If oil entered the Gulf Stream it 
could be forced up into the Chesapeake Bay, the Hudson River Valley, 
the Gulf of Maine, and the Grand Banks, which are some of the richest 
fishing grounds in the world.
    The Gulf of Mexico BP Deepwater Horizon blowout showed that oil 
cannot be removed from salt marshes and other wetland systems. It can 
remain in the sediments for decades, as was seen in marshes in 
Massachusetts. Coastal salt marshes in South Carolina are among the 
most productive ecosystems in the world and are nursery grounds for 
many estuarine and marine species. Toxic substances from oil spills, 
both chronic and acute, will put all of these organisms at risk.
    Even if a spill never occurs--and both the oil industry and the 
Federal Government admit that spills are inevitable--there's still an 
adverse impact to South Carolina's coast in that the land-based 
infrastructure necessary to support offshore drilling is dirty and 
highly industrial. Also, the infrastructure required to transport 
offshore oil is devastating. For example, a series of canals built 
across Louisiana wetlands to transport oil has led to vast destruction 
of marshlands. Healthy marshlands are a critical component of our 
ecosystem.
    Sometimes we hear elected officials claim that they want to explore 
and drill for natural gas only, while leaving the oil in the ground. 
One doesn't explore for just gas. By law, they must first produce the 
oil before they produce the gas in order to ``maximize ultimate 
recovery . . .'' \13\ This is because when oil and gas occur together 
in a reservoir, as the oil is produced, the gas cap expands helping to 
remove the oil, essentially pushing it out of the pore spaces in the 
rocks. When exploration wells are drilled, one finds oil and/or gas 
and/or water and/or nothing. Then the oil company determines if it's 
economical to produce the reserves they found, and if so, submits a 
plan to BOEM about how they will produce the well.

                               economics
    Hydraulic fracking has increased domestic petroleum production by 
64 percent. The Federal Energy Information Administration now predicts 
the Nation will be a net energy exporter within a decade--for the first 
time since the 1970s. There's no need for offshore oil production off 
South Carolina's coast, especially in light of the costs noted above.
    The American Petroleum Institute says oil and gas drilling could 
result in $2.7 billion to South Carolina over a two-decade period. That 
sounds like a fairly big number, but according to the South Carolina 
Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism, tourists in South 
Carolina spent nearly 10 times that amount--more than $20 billion--in 
2015 alone, with about 60 percent of that resulting from tourism to 
coastal areas. Even the most lucrative oil and gas scenario would 
generate less than 1 percent of the economic impact tourism has on the 
state. Further, these industries do not live harmoniously. Along the 
Gulf Coast, beachgoers are provided with wipes to clean the oil and tar 
balls from their feet after walking the beach. To the residents of 
South Carolina, that scenario is unacceptable, as our beaches are major 
revenue generators, and part of our way of life. Moreover, tourism 
revenue increases every year with no signs of that trend slowing; the 
same cannot be said of the demand for oil.
    This new National OCS Program proposes to offer leases in areas 
that have extensive military operations, thus risking our national 
security training and readiness. The draft plan deviates from the long-
standing tradition of deference to the Department of Defense (DoD) when 
offering offshore drilling leases in Federal waters. The Atlantic and 
Eastern Gulf of Mexico are home to critical coastal military 
facilities, including Norfolk Naval Station--the largest naval station 
in the world. In the Atlantic Ocean, DoD conducts extensive readiness 
operations including live fire tests, air-to-surface bombing exercises, 
homing torpedo testing, supersonic test flights, laser targeting 
operations, and both Naval Air and Sea Systems Command. DoD's 2015 
report on mission compatibility with offshore leasing indicated that 
significant restrictions on oil and gas activity in the Mid-Atlantic 
and South Atlantic planning regions would be necessary to ensure that 
DoD activities would not be impaired.
    Furthermore, DoD has made it clear that the continuation of the 
moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico is 
essential to vital military readiness activities. An April 2017 letter 
from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense states, ``The 
Department of Defense (DoD) cannot overstate the vital importance of 
maintaining this moratorium.'' The letter continues, ``The moratorium 
on oil and gas `leasing, pre-leasing, and other related activities' 
ensures that these vital military readiness activities may be conducted 
without interference and is critical to their continuation. Emerging 
technologies . . . will require enlarged testing and training 
footprints, and increased DoD reliance of the Gulf of Mexico Energy 
Security Act's moratorium beyond 2022.'' A separate June 2017 letter 
from the Air Force states, ``The moratorium is essential for developing 
and sustaining the Air Force's future combat capabilities.''
    That total amount of energy resources, according to Department of 
the Interior estimates, would keep the United States in oil for 61 
days. And there's no guarantee that the drilling will pan out at all. 
Five wells have been drilled in this section of the Atlantic in the 
past, the last being in 1962. All were abandoned. Cuba has put down 
four wells as recently as 2012, and all were found to be uneconomical, 
and have been capped. These numbers are peanuts compared to what South 
Carolina produced annually in GDP and jobs generated by healthy ocean 
ecosystems including fishing, recreation and tourism. In 2014 alone, 
these industries generated over $4.4 billion in GDP and nearly 79,000 
jobs.\14\ Industrializing our coast and risking our ocean and way of 
life is not worth the economic trade-off.

                           alternative energy
    We must wean ourselves from dirty, nonrenewable fossil fuels and 
invest more in renewable sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. 
External costs, or externalities, are never fully allocated to 
companies that drill for oil--and that gives such companies an unfair 
advantage over companies developing alternative sources of energy--
sources that tend to be, by design, cleaner and more sustainable.
      forms of opposition to offshore seismic testing and drilling
    Legal: When the prior administration removed the Atlantic coast 
from the Five-Year Plan for 2017-2022, they also rejected six permits 
pending to begin seismic testing for oil and gas. Instead of requiring 
new seismic survey applications, the Secretary of Interior remanded the 
applications. These now outdated applications are currently in the 
process of being reviewed by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management 
(BOEM) and associated Federal agencies, including the National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS). In order for the seismic permits to move 
forward, NMFS must first issue ``Incidental Harassment Authorizations'' 
to allow the ``taking'' of marine mammals. There is no new significant 
science that counters the logic used by the previous administration's 
reasoning for denying these permits. If anything, the science has 
increasingly shown harm to marine life from seismic airgun blasting. 
Worse, if the seismic permits are issued, paving the way for oil and 
gas exploration and drilling the Administration should expect immediate 
litigation from state and local governments, constituents and NGOs 
across the Atlantic coast.
    Political: Recently, Secretary Zinke met with Florida Governor Rick 
Scott on the tarmac of the Tallahassee Airport, where in front of 
several TV cameras, the Secretary announced that due to the Governor's 
opposition to Florida being included in the 5-year plan, and Florida's 
unique coastal environment and tourism, the state will now be removed 
from the 5-year plan. While that is great that the Governor and 
Secretary are listening to local leaders, businesses and constituents, 
nearly every other state along the Atlantic Coast has requested the 
same meeting and treatment Governor Scott received. In fact, on the 
East Coast, governors from Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, 
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, New 
Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts all oppose the newly released 
draft 5-year plan. It should be noted that the governors of Georgia and 
Maine have recently shifted their position from supporting more 
offshore drilling off their coast to expressing concerns with this new 
National OCS program. Additionally, it's not entirely clear that 
Florida is removed, formally, until the Proposed Program is released.
                   bottom line: who do we want to be?
    The opposition is bipartisan and wide-ranging. More than 160 
municipalities along the East Coast have passed resolutions opposing 
offshore oil and gas drilling and exploration. In addition, the New 
England, Mid-Atlantic, and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils; 
the Department of Defense; Air Force; Florida Defense Support Task 
Force and NASA have all weighed in to express serious concerns or 
opposition to these activities. More than 42,000 businesses and 500,000 
fishing families have also joined this overwhelming chorus of voices 
and officially said ``no'' to testing and/or drilling.
    Some politicians try to straddle the fence, saying they want the 
jobs the oil industry would bring, but they don't want to do anything 
to harm our beaches and tourism. But you can't have both. You cannot 
wholeheartedly protect the environment South Carolina is fortunate to 
enjoy, yet be willing to risk it for the unknown.
    Seismic testing and oil drilling pose unknown threats to our coast 
that could include devastating damage to our beach communities and the 
water quality we enjoy. Oil and water should not mix, and now is a time 
of choosing. We must pick one or the other. Coastal communities and 
local voices have already voiced their choice. We want to protect our 
water, our coast, and way of life from unacceptable and devastating 
impacts of seismic testing and offshore drilling. Washington needs to 
listen.
    I thank you for the opportunity to testify here today and I look 
forward to answering your questions.
                                 ______
    Dr. Gosar. Thank you, Senator Davis.
    Mr. Steen, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Mr. Steen. Thank you, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member 
Lowenthal, and members of the Subcommittee. My name is Ryan 
Steen, and I am a partner in the law firm of Stoel Rives. I 
present this testimony on behalf of my client, the 
International Association of Geophysical Contractors. I 
appreciate the Subcommittee's invitation to testify regarding 
the significant need for and support for modernizing the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act, known as the MMPA. My testimony is based 
upon my experience representing a variety of clients in Federal 
regulatory and litigation matters involving many aspects of the 
MMPA and related environmental statutes.
    Although well intended at the time it was enacted, the MMPA 
has proven unworkable in many contexts, particularly its 
provisions for the authorization of incidental take. In a 
nutshell, those provisions are hopelessly ambiguous and give no 
clear direction to agencies or to the regulated community. 
Additionally, Incidental Harassment Authorizations involving 
offshore oil and gas activities are rarely, if ever, issued 
within the required time frames.
    Unfortunately, the MMPA provides no consequence or remedy 
for such delay. In the past decade, these problems have 
manifested in the form of routinely delayed permitting 
processes, inaccurate analyses of potential impacts, and 
opportunistic advocacy litigation intended to impede offshore 
development.
    None of this is faithful to Congress' mandate that the 
Federal Government pursue the ``expeditious and orderly'' 
development of the Outer Continental Shelf. These serious 
problems have most recently been on display in the Federal 
Government's processing of applications to conduct seismic 
surveys in the Atlantic. The permitting process for these 
applications is a bureaucratic maze, as depicted by the figure 
on the screen.
    After extensive environmental review at the programmatic 
level, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management published a record 
of decision in July 2014 authorizing the consideration of 
permits for seismic surveys in the Atlantic. Since then, the 
pending permit applications have been subjected to a regulatory 
process plagued with delays and uncertainty, capped by the 
Obama administration's abrupt political decision on the eve of 
a new Presidency to summarily deny all permit applications.
    BOEM has since correctly reinstated the permit applications 
which remain under agency review. While there have been many 
unprecedented and extra statutory comment periods added to this 
process, the Atlantic delays are due in large part to the 
National Marine Fisheries Service's extreme delay in its 
processing of applications for marine mammal incidental take 
authorization.
    To date, NMFS is delinquent in meeting the statutory 
timeline by well over 2 years. NMFS has largely blamed this 
delay on the supposed need to continue to evaluate various 
forms of purported new information; however, as the courts have 
routinely held, an agency cannot ``revise its action every time 
new data or a new model is announced because doing so would 
lead to significant costs and potentially endless delays in the 
approval processes.''
    As another example, over the past decade, almost every MMPA 
incidental take regulation issued for offshore oil and gas 
activities in the Arctic has been challenged in court by 
advocacy organizations attempting to exploit many of the MMPA's 
ambiguous provisions and related duplicative processes. In 
every instance and on all counts, the regulations have been 
upheld by the Federal, district, and appellate courts. However, 
as intended by advocacy groups, these lawsuits have cost the 
courts, agencies, and applicants substantial time and money.
    As environmental advocacy groups increasingly view offshore 
issues, specifically opposition to seismic surveys as a 
lucrative source of fundraising, MMPA incidental take 
authorizations for those activities will become increasingly 
contentious. Without changes to the MMPA to create 
accountability and clear standards, NMFS will continue to be 
frozen by controversy and ambiguous statutory direction, which 
in turn will breed more litigation.
    The Secure American Energy Act would establish firm 
deadlines for each stage of the MMPA authorization process, 
including consequences for the failure to meet those deadlines. 
The bill would also eliminate duplicative and unnecessary 
standards and processes. The bill would retain all existing 
opportunities for public involvement. The bill would not, as 
has been suggested, eliminate mitigation requirements or reduce 
substantive protections for marine mammals. Rather, the bill 
helps to accomplish what any reasonable person would expect of 
a Federal regulatory program: transparent standards, firm 
timelines, efficient process, and elimination of redundancy.
    Indeed, the only basis for opposing this bill would be an 
antagonism to efficient Federal processes and a desire for the 
ambiguities and inefficiencies that create opportunities for 
delay and litigation.
    On behalf of IAGC, I urge the Committee on Natural 
Resources to support House passage of legislation to modernize 
the MMPA. This would, in my view and experience, significantly 
and objectively improve the administration of the MMPA.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
