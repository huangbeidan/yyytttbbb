    &lt;Doc-title&gt;COMBATING TRANSNATIONAL GANGS THROUGH INFORMATION SHARING&lt;/Doc-title&gt;
    &lt;overview&gt;Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence,&lt;/overview&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker=""&gt;Also present: Representative McCaul.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker=""&gt;Mr. Perry [presiding]. Good morning. The Committee on 
Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and 
Intelligence will come to order. The subcommittee is meeting 
today to hear testimony from the FBI, the Department of 
Homeland Security, and the Department of State on Federal 
coordination and information sharing vital to dismantling 
transnational criminal organizations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker=""&gt;I would like to welcome the Members of the subcommittee and 
express my appreciation to the witnesses for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker=""&gt;The Chair now recognizes himself for an opening statement, 
after which I will deliver Mr. King's opening statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker=""&gt;Law enforcement officers use many weapons to fight 
terrorism and crime in our streets. Some of these weapons, such 
as badges, guns, and squad cars are easy to see. They are the 
hallmarks of police work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker=""&gt;There are other weapons, however, that are harder to 
identify but every bit as vital. Among these less visible 
weapons the access to timely and accurate information is 
oftentimes the difference between a successful investigation 
and an unsolved crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker=""&gt;In today's threat environment, much of the information 
needed by law enforcement in the United States is generated 
overseas. This is particularly true when it comes to combating 
complex transnational criminal organizations that threaten our 
safety here at home.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker=""&gt;These sophisticated criminal enterprises do not stop at 
borders. Instead, they extend beyond the limits imposed by 
nation-states and threaten the peace and stability of multiple 
countries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker=""&gt;The only way to defeat syndicates that operate across 
international borders is through partnerships with foreign 
counterparts. It is incumbent on U.S. law enforcement agencies 
to work with our overseas allies to ensure that coordinated 
enforcement efforts are brought to bear against the menace that 
MS-13 and other TCOs pose to our Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker=""&gt;In addition to information sharing, another essential step 
in fighting--in addition to information sharing, another 
essential step in the fight against TCOs is to develop the 
capacity of our foreign partners to defeat these networks 
before they become a threat to the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker=""&gt;Today's hearing will feature testimony from representatives 
of Federal agencies tasked with combating the spread of TCOs. 
These entities bring various tools and capabilities to the 
fight, including investigating and prosecuting TCOs, as well as 
working with our foreign counterparts to strengthen and support 
their efforts to disrupt and dismantle TCOs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker=""&gt;These witnesses include executives from the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation from the Department of Justice and Homeland 
Security Investigations from the Department of Homeland 
Security and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement Affairs from the Department of State. All of these 
agencies participate in protecting the U.S. homeland by working 
to defeat TCOs overseas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker=""&gt;Each of these agencies is responsible for collecting, 
vetting, and disseminating TCO-related information. Sharing 
this overseas information with State and local domestic law 
enforcement agencies enhances the ability of our men and women 
in blue to keep this country safe at home from the threat posed 
by TCOs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker=""&gt;I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. Their 
understanding and vast experiences will provide the committee 
with a comprehensive overview of how the cycle of international 
information-sharing functions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Chairman King follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Chairman King "&gt;This overview will, in turn, afford the committee an 
opportunity to identify enhancements that can be made to better 
equip U.S. law enforcement at all levels to share information 
in their efforts to disrupt and dismantle TCOs, both home and 
abroad.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Chairman King "&gt;Statement of Chairman Peter T. King&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Chairman King "&gt;January 18, 2018&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Chairman King "&gt;Law enforcement officers use many weapons to fight terrorism and 
crime on our streets. Some of these weapons, such as badges, guns, and 
squad cars, are easy to see. They are the hallmarks of police work. 
There are other weapons, however, that are harder to identify but every

sophisticated criminal enterprises do not stop at borders. Instead,

peace and stability of multiple countries. The only way to defeat 
syndicates that operate across international borders is through 
partnerships with foreign counterparts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Chairman King "&gt;This issue is of particular concern to the people of Long Island. 
Specifically, the violent street gang MS-13, which has been designated 
as a TCO, has inflicted much death and destruction in Nassau and 
Suffolk Counties. The horrendous criminal actions of MS-13 
disproportionately affect the youth of immigrant communities on Long 
Island. In the last 14 months, the murders of 17 people in Suffolk 
County alone have been linked to MS-13 violence. It is incumbent on 
U.S. law enforcement agencies to work with our overseas allies to 
ensure that coordinated enforcement efforts are brought to bear against 
the menace that MS-13 and other TCOs pose to our Nation. In addition to 
information sharing, another essential step in the fight against TCOs 
is to develop the capacity of our foreign partners to defeat these 
networks before they become a threat to the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I now recognize Ranking Member Rice for her
opening statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Miss Rice. Thank you, Chairman Perry for holding today's 
hearing and thank you to the witnesses for your testimony 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;In June 2017 we held a similar hearing on how we can both 
combat transnational gang violence on Long Island while 
empowering young people with the knowledge, support, and 
resources that they need to reject gangs in our communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;As we find ourselves here to discuss a similar topic again, 
I hope that today's discussion will include a broad look at 
transnational criminal organizations around the world. As we 
all know, MS-13 and the 18th Street gang and rival gangs are 
criminal organizations who commit brutal acts of violence and 
have taken too many lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;They, like other transnational gangs, are organizations 
that revel in violence, create fear, and terrorize the 
communities in which they live and operate and recruit their 
members.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;As the formal Nassau County district attorney, I have seen 
first-hand how vicious and unrepentant these gangs are. I have 
seen MS-13 and 18th Street gang members laugh at the judge as 
they were sentenced to life in prison or they were deported.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;So I want the record to be clear. I believe all violent 
criminals should be punished to the full extent of the law. I 
believe that violent criminals who are in this country 
illegally should be deported and prevented from ever coming 
back. I believe that dismantling violent criminal organizations 
like MS-13 must be a priority for law enforcement officials and 
lawmakers at all levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;However, I also know for a fact that the vast majority of 
immigrants in this country are not criminals. They are usually 
the victims of crime rather than the perpetrators.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I know and understand that you cannot destroy a gang like 
MS-13 without the help of immigrant communities. You need 
members of the community to talk to you, provide information, 
report crimes, and for that they need to trust you. They need 
to know that stepping forward to help will not lead to them 
being detained and deported and ripped away from their 
families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I will remind the committee and my Republican colleagues 
that many of the members of MS-13 are, in fact, immigrants and 
children and descendants of immigrants that have become victims 
of gang threats, violence, and recruitment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;More, it is clear to me that President Trump, Attorney 
General Sessions, and Republicans in Congress have sought and 
continue to use the threat of MS-13 to justify their push to 
build a wall on the Southern Border and round up and deport 
millions of immigrants, including those whose only crime is 
being in this country without paperwork.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Last week, President Trump and DHS Secretary Nielsen made 
another shameful anti-immigrant decision by ending temporary 
protected status for 31,000 Salvadoran TPS holders in new York, 
which will send families back to a country that is overrun with 
gang violence and drug trafficking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;This decision came on the heels of the Trump 
administration's decision to end DACA and temporary protected 
status for Haitians and Nicaraguans. Republicans have made it 
clear that they are not concerned about the destabilizing 
effects that such U.S. policies will have on communities like 
the one that Peter King and I serve on Long Island.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;On average, TPS recipients in our State have lived in the 
United States for an average of 21 years. They are our 
neighbors, our friends, and our co-workers. Now, I recognize 
that this hearing is not about TPS, but I also recognize the 
Republican-controlled Congress does not want to negotiate so I 
have to use every platform to address this issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;[The statement of Ranking Member Rice follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Statement of Ranking Member Kathleen Rice&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;January 18, 2018&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;In June of 2017, we held a similar hearing on how we can both 
combat transnational gang violence on Long Island, while empowering 
young people with the knowledge, support, and resources they need to 
reject gangs in our communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;As we find ourselves here to discuss a similar topic again, I hope 
that today's discussion will include a broad look at transnational 
criminal organizations around the world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;As we all know, MS-13, the 18th Street Gang, and rival gangs are 
criminal organizations who commit brutal acts of violence and have 
taken too many lives. They, like other transnational gangs are 
organizations that revel in violence, crave fear, and terrorize the 
communities in which they live and operate and recruit their members.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;As the former Nassau County District Attorney, I've seen first-hand 
how vicious and unrepentant these gangs are. I've seen MS-13 and 18th 
Street Gang members laugh at the judge as they were sentenced to life 
in prison or deported.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;So I want the record to be clear, I believe all violent criminals 
should be punished to the full extent of the law. I believe that 
violent criminals who are in this country illegally should be deported 
and prevented from ever coming back. I believe that dismantling violent 
criminal organizations like MS-13 must be a priority for law 
enforcement officials and lawmakers at all levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;However, I also know for a fact that the vast majority of 
immigrants in this country are not criminals--they are usually the 
victims of crime rather than the perpetrators.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I know and understand that you cannot destroy a gang like MS-13 
without the help of immigrant communities. You need members of the 
community to talk to you, provide information, report crimes--and for 
that, they need to trust you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;They need to know that stepping forward to help will not lead to 
them being detained and deported and ripped away from their families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

of the members of MS-13 are, in fact, immigrants and children and 
descendants of immigrants that have become victims of gang threats, 
violence, recruitment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

the destabilizing effects that such U.S. policies will have on 
communities like the ones Chairman King and I serve on Long Island.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;On average TPS recipients in our State have lived in the United

and our coworkers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;    I recognize this hearing isn't about TPS, but I also recognize a 
Republican-controlled Congress doesn't want to negotiate, so I have to 
use every platform I have to address this issue.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;The Chair thanks the gentlelady.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;    The Chair now thanks the Chairman of the full committee, 
the gentleman from Texas, Mr. McCaul.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McCaul&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Perry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;Transnational Criminal Organizations are a serious and 
growing threat to the American people. They disregard the rule 
of law of all nations and use their networks to smuggle drugs 
and traffic human beings for sexual exploitation and slave 
labor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;They resort to brutal violence and intimidation tactics to 
carry out their illegal deeds. These networks of vile 
individuals and gangs like MS-13 have been known to kidnap, 
torture, and behead their victims. Top officials at DHS are 
very alarmed by their actions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;Before becoming White House Chief of Staff, Secretary of 
Homeland Security John Kelly explained to a National security 
forum last July, to me personally, that one of his top concerns 
is a partnership between TCOs and international terror groups.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;If such alliances were formed, terrorists would have an 
easier time sneaking a dirty bomb or other catastrophic weapon 
and resources into the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;Further, in written testimony before our full committee 
back in November, Acting Secretary Duke stated that TCOs are, 
``bringing drugs, violence, and dangerous goods across our 
borders and pose a persistent National security threat to the 
United States''.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;Unfortunately, some of these partnerships are starting to 
take hold. Recent reports have shown that Hezbollah has been 
very active in recent years with international drug cartels in 
Latin America. We cannot allow such dangerous actors to gather 
in our hemisphere unchallenged.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;The ability of TCOs secreting terrorists and WMD into our 
country is a grave threat. This committee is going to undertake 
a thorough review of these possibilities so that we can prevent 
them from happening. Sadly, these TCOs have an easy time 
infiltrating our communities because the security of our 
Southern Border is just not strong enough to stop them. 
Hopefully, we will soon be able to fix that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;Legislation I introduced to strengthen border security with 
new infrastructure including a wall, more boots on the ground 
and new technology, was passed out of our full committee in 
October.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;Last week, that important legislation was incorporated into 
a larger bill to fix our broken immigration system. I am 
hopeful that we can pass it through the Congress and get it to 
the President's desk very soon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;All three branches of Government working together is 
essential in this fight, but we must also create and foster 
partnerships with governments in Latin America to help 
eliminate these threats from TCOs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;One of the most important lessons we learned from the 9/11 
attacks is that we must effectively communicate vital 
information among Federal departments and law enforcement 
agencies. Doing so will save many innocent lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;Today's witnesses represent the hardworking men and women 
from FBI, ICE, and State Department, who work very hard for the 
protection of their fellow Americans, and I would like to thank 
each of you individuals for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;Before I yield back I just want to say on a personal note 
before becoming a Member of Congress I was the chief of 
Counterterrorism and National Security in the Western District 
of Texas in the U.S. Attorney's Office. I had the Texas and 
Mexico border in my jurisdiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;I have been dealing with this issue for quite some time, 
seven terms in Congress and many years as a Federal prosecutor. 
This problem has not stopped. It has gotten worse. It has not 
gotten better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;It is now more of a threat. I think it cries out for action 
from Congress and from the administration to finally, once and 
for all, get this job done.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. McCaul"&gt;[The statement of Chairman McCaul follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;The Chair thanks the gentleman. Other Members of
the committee are reminded that opening statements may be

    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;[The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;January 18, 2018&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;This hearing is focused on Federal information sharing related to 
combating transnational gangs and criminal organizations, but given the 
recent antics from the White House I cannot address this topic in a 
vacuum.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;President Trump began his campaign with an attack on immigrants and 
continues to use his administration to advance an agenda that is based 
on racial and ethnic bias.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;One of his first actions as President was a travel ban from 
majority Muslim countries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Last fall, Trump ended the Deferred Action Childhood Arrival 
program, upending the lives of many young immigrants, who have only 
known the United States as their home.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;On January 8, the Trump administration made a decision to cancel 
the Temporary Protected Status for people from El Salvador, mere months 
after the same decision was made regarding those that have sought 
shelter and compassion in the U.S. from Haiti and Nicaragua.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;This week, the Trump administration released a misleading report, 
which purports that foreign-born individuals commit terror at very high 
rates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;The data in the report perpetuates a myth that all immigrants are a 
threat and a danger to our communities and country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;The report is yet another propaganda tool by the Trump 
administration consisting of falsehoods and half-truths to support its 
narrow-minded policies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;President Trump is becoming more and more comfortable openly 
stoking xenophobia to garner support for his misguided immigration and 
border security plans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Republicans in Congress seemingly agree with President Trump, as 
they are silent when his administration spews misinformation, turn a 
blind eye to his despicable decisions TPS and Dreamers, and refuse to 
denounce the vile remarks he has made about immigrants from Latin 
American, African, and Middle Eastern countries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Republican Members of Congress, some of whom serve on this 
committee, recently scrambled to justify a string of heartless actions 
by the Trump administration all of which are in support of his border 
wall.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Those who allege rampant exploitation of our borders and 
immigration system by transnational gangs like MS-13 often fail to 
acknowledge the hundreds of millions of immigrants that reside legally 
and peacefully in our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;After 1 year, it has become crystal clear that President Trump does 
not understand how important immigrant communities are to the history, 
makeup, and future of our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;We are left to wonder whether many Republican Members of Congress 
actually agree with Trump or are simply afraid to hold him accountable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;The committee has examined transnational gangs in the past, 
including a subcommittee field hearing on MS-13 in Long Island, New 
York, last summer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;However, this administration and Republicans have focused solely on 
the threat from MS-13, while Democrats acknowledge that there are a 
wide range of threats posed by transnational gangs and TCOs, not just 
MS-13.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I want to be clear, I remain committed to protecting our homeland 
from transnational criminal threats and activities such as murder, 
assault, human trafficking, money laundering, and cyber crime, as well 
as drug trafficking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;    However, I am not willing to give President Trump a blank check to 
carry out his dangerous, un-American policy goals.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;We are pleased to have a distinguished panel of
witnesses before us today on this important topic. All the 
witnesses are reminded that their written testimony will be 
submitted for the record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Our first witness is Mr. Stephen E. Richardson, the 
assistant director for the Criminal Investigative Division of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Richardson joined the 
FBI as a special agent in 1996. He has worked with the bureau 
in Louisiana, Tennessee, Virginia, and several stints at 
headquarters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Throughout his career, he has specialized in the 
investigation of white-collar crime, public corruption, hate 
crime, violent crime, gang matters, and counterterrorism. Since 
April 2016 Mr. Richardson has served as assistant director of 
the Criminal Investigation Division with oversight of all FBI 
criminal matters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Thank you for being here today and--does he recognize 
individually or all? OK. Well, thank you for being here today 
and we are going to recognize you individually.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF STEPHEN E. RICHARDSON, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR,&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="STEPHEN E. RICHARDSON"&gt;So you can begin with your testimony, Mr. Richardson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="STEPHEN E. RICHARDSON"&gt;      CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION, FEDERAL BUREAU OF 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Representative Perry, Chairman McCaul,
Ranking Member Rice, and Members of the committee, I would like 
to thank each of you for inviting me here today to discuss this 
very important issue. My name is Steve Richardson and I am the 
assistant director for the FBI's Criminal Investigative 
Division.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;The issues that we are going to talk about today fall under 
my leadership at the FBI. The FBI is dedicated to defeating 
those transnational organized crime groups referred to as TOC 
groups, which pose the greatest threat to our National and 
economic security.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;To combat the on-going threat posed by these groups, the 
FBI has a long-established TOC program. The FBI uses the 
Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act to expand 
criminal accountability for a number of predicate offenses and 
to expand a single offense across multiple members of a 
criminal enterprise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Utilizing a multi-pronged approach to target a variety of 
criminal activities and impact the group's financial stability, 
the FBI is able to disrupt or dismantle the entire enterprise, 
not just a few key people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;The FBI leverages trusted relationships both domestically 
and internationally to combat and influence the reach of these 
transnational criminal enterprises. The FBI has long been a 
proponent of the task force model, and in 1992 we stood up the 
first Safe Streets Violent Gang Task Force, specifically to 
address transnational gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;The mission of these task forces is to fully integrate our 
State and local partners to address threats posed by violent 
criminal gangs in communities across our great country. This 
involves working with State and local task force officers, 
commonly referred to as TFOs, who have direct knowledge of the 
criminal activities occurring within their specific 
jurisdictions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;The collaboration of FBI special agents and local law 
enforcement creates a comprehensive approach utilizing both 
State and Federal statutes to address these violent gangs from 
top to bottom.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;The FBI currently operates and provides oversight to 169 of 
these particular task forces comprised of nearly 800 special 
agents, 1,400 TFOs, and 58 other Federal law enforcement 
partners in all of the FBI's 56 field offices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Collectively these task forces average approximately 5,100 
arrests of violent criminal gang members annually and have 
averaged over 2,000 seizures of firearms in each of the past 2 
years. Our ultimate goal and the goal of each task force is to 
have a positive effect on the communities by disrupting and 
dismantling violent criminal organizations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;On the international front, the FBI's Transnational Anti-
gang Task Forces, we refer to those at TAGs, work with 
international partners to target transnational gangs, both 
domestically and internationally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;The TAG program was created through cooperation between the 
FBI and the U.S. Department of State in El Salvador, Guatemala, 
and Honduras and is responsible for the investigation of the 
MS-13 gang and other violent transnational gangs such as the 
18th Street gang.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;The mission of the TAG is to conduct gang enforcement 
operations and gather actionable strategic intelligence for 
domestic use by our Safe Streets Violent Gang Task Forces and 
to further disseminate this information to U.S. law enforcement 
partners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Recently, the TAG has conducted a coordinated arrest 
operation in all three countries in the Northern Triangle, 
targeting both MS-13 and 18th Street, resulting in the arrest 
of 754 violent gang members. The arrest also led to the seizure 
of multiple items of evidence which are currently being 
exploited for their intelligence value.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Apart from our task forces, the FBI's Criminal 
Investigative Division actively participates in multi-agency 
intelligence entities, such as the National Gang Intelligence 
Center, Special Operations Division, and Organized Crime Drug 
Enforcement Task Force or OCDETF Fusion Center.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Although vetting and possible arrest of individuals at the 
border is primarily a function of the Department of Homeland 
Security, the FBI makes every effort to gather and share 
intelligence on a timely basis related to the movement and 
recruitment of gang members prior to and upon entry into the 
United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Information sharing is critical to fulfilling this 
responsibility and the FBI is dedicated to improving 
communication with our partners. Please know we will continue 
to direct tremendous resources and effort to targeting, 
investigating, prosecuting, and dismantling these transnational 
criminal gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Richardson follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Chairman McCaul, Chairman King, Representative Perry, 
Ranking Member Rice, and other Members of the committee, I 
thank you again for having me here today. I am honored to 
represent the FBI and the fine men and women of our 
organization, and I look forward to answering your questions. 
Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Prepared Statement of Stephen E. Richardson&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;January 18, 2018&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Good morning Chairman McCaul, Chairman King, Ranking Member Rice, 
and Members of the committee. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) efforts to combat the 
transnational gang threat and the FBI's use of task forces.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;The FBI is dedicated to eliminating transnational organized crime 
(TOC) groups that pose the greatest threat to the National and economic 
security of the United States. Some TOC groups can be hierarchies, 
clans, networks, or cells, and may evolve into other structures. The 
depth and financial stability of these organizations often allow them 
to continue long after key members are removed. Therefore, the FBI 
targets entire organizations responsible for a variety of criminal 
activities. TOC groups are independent associations that operate by 
illegal means across borders, and many of these associations encompass 
both the Eastern and Western hemispheres. With the increase of 
technology available around the world, TOC groups are more commonly 
incorporating cyber techniques into their illicit activities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;To combat the on-going threat posed by these groups, the FBI has a 
long-established transnational organized crime program dedicated to 
eliminating the criminal enterprises that pose the greatest threat to 
America. The FBI uses the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations (RICO) Act to target entire criminal organizations and to 
address the full extent of the criminal conduct by the leaders, 
members, and associates of those organizations. Unlike typical 
investigations, which target a single criminal act, this multi-pronged 
approach allows the FBI to disrupt or dismantle the entire enterprise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;The FBI leverages political and law enforcement relationships 
domestically and abroad to combat the influence and reach of these 
organized crime groups due to the transnational nature of these 
criminal enterprises.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;The FBI also participates in selecting TOC groups to appear on the 
Department of Justice's Top International Criminal Organizations Target 
(TICOT) List, and contributes to the Treasury Department's Office of 
Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) efforts to pursue criminal enterprises. 
Further, to pool resources and leverage technical and investigative 
expertise, the FBI participates in many Organized Crime Task Forces 
consisting of State and local law enforcement partners in the United 
States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Specific to transnational gangs, the FBI established the first Safe 
Streets Violent Gang Task Force (SSVGTF) in 1992. The mission of our 
SSVGTFs is to fully integrate our State and local partners to address 
threats posed by violent criminal gangs that have a destructive effect 
in our communities across the country. A key component of this success 
involves the utilization of Task Force Officers (TFOs) who have direct 
knowledge of the criminal activity occurring in their jurisdictions. 
This collaboration of FBI Special Agents and local law enforcement 
creates a comprehensive approach to addressing these violent gangs from 
top to bottom utilizing the Enterprise Theory of Investigation (ETI). 
ETIs are intelligence-driven investigations which seek to identify the 
hierarchy of a criminal enterprise and the scope of their criminal 
activity. The SSVGTF can then utilize State and Federal statutes to 
address all elements of the violent criminal organization. The success 
of the SSVGTFs is directly related to the ability to cross-
programmatically leverage all resources and expertise of the FBI.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;The FBI currently operates and provides oversight to 169 SSVGTFs 
comprised of nearly 800 Special Agents, 1,400 TFOs, and 58 other 
Federal law enforcement partners in all of the FBI's 56 field offices. 
Collectively, these SSVGTFs average approximately 5,100 arrests of 
violent criminal gang members annually. Additionally, SSVGTFs have 
averaged over 2,000 seizures of firearms in each of the past 2 years. 
Although the numbers are impressive, the ultimate goal of all SSVGTFs 
is to have a positive effect on communities by disrupting and 
dismantling the violent criminal organizations that exist within them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;In addition to our domestic task forces, the FBI's Transnational 
Anti-Gang Task Forces (TAGs) continue to work with international 
partners to eradicate transnational gangs domestically and 
internationally. The TAG program was first created in 2007 in El 
Salvador through the cooperation between the FBI and the U.S. 
Department of State. The TAG expanded to Guatemala and Honduras in 2009 
and 2011, respectively. The TAG is currently comprised of six FBI 
Special Agents and 120 vetted police officers. Each TAG is a fully 
operational unit responsible for the investigation of MS-13 and other 
violent transnational gangs, such as 18th Street. The focus of the TAG 
is to conduct gang enforcement operations and gather actionable, 
strategic intelligence for domestic use by the SSVGTFs and 
dissemination to U.S. law enforcement partners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Additional valuable intelligence provided by the TAG include: 
Affiliations with other violent criminal gangs; associations with drug 
cartels; and illicit activity, such as human trafficking and firearms 
trafficking. Recently, the TAG conducted a coordinated transnational 
gang arrest operation in all three countries. The operation targeted 
members of both MS-13 and 18th Street, resulting in the arrests of 754 
MS-13 and 18th Street gang members. The arrests also led to the seizure 
of multiple items of evidence, which are being exploited for their 
intelligence value.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;The FBI utilizes a comprehensive approach combining intelligence 
with operations to more effectively combat gang violence. Apart from 
our task forces, the FBI has numerous analysts and agents dedicated to 
studying the threats posed by MS-13 and other transnational criminal 
gangs via the National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC). NGIC is a 
multi-agency intelligence entity that supports law enforcement agencies 
through timely and accurate information sharing and strategic/tactical 
analysis of Federal, State, and local law enforcement intelligence. 
NGIC is co-located at FBIHQ with the Safe Streets Gang Unit to further 
enhance integration of intelligence and operations. Additionally, the 
FBI's Criminal Investigative Division (CID) participates in the Special 
Operations Division (SOD) which is a multi-agency intelligence center 
wherein the FBI is one of over 30 partners. The primary focus of SOD is 
to identify and target command-and-control communications of those 
criminal organizations that operate across regional, National, and 
international boundaries and to facilitate de-confliction and 
coordination of law enforcement investigations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;In addition to SOD, the FBI participates in the Organized Crime 
Drug Enforcement Task Force's (OCDETF) Fusion Center (OFC); this 
collaborative integrated center is a multi-agency operational 
intelligence center that provides law enforcement with analytical 
resources, case de-confliction, and information sharing to develop the 
most complete intelligence picture of targeted drug trafficking 
organizations and other complex criminal organizations. The OFC brings 
together 112 datasets from 21 separate Federal and international 
agencies, along with open-source information, to generate intelligence 
products for FBI investigations. Furthermore, the FBI continues to be a 
vital participant in scores of OCDETF investigations that are 
countering TCOs and Transnational Gangs, like MS-13. In October 2017, 
the Attorney General explicitly directed that MS-13 be a priority of 
the multi-agency OCDETF Program, authorizing and encouraging 
investigative agencies and prosecutors to leverage OCDETF's funding, 
infrastructure, and other resources to target MS-13.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Although the vetting and possible arrest of individuals at the 
border is primarily a function of the Department of Homeland Security, 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the FBI makes every effort to 
gather intelligence related to the movement and recruitment of these 
gang members prior to and upon entry into the United States. 
Information sharing with our partners is critical to fulfilling this 
responsibility, and the FBI is continually working to improve the way 
in which we and our partners communicate. Please know we will continue 
to dedicate tremendous resources and efforts to targeting, 
investigating, prosecuting, and dismantling these transnational 
criminal gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Chairman McCaul, Chairman King, Ranking Member Rice, and Members of 
the committee, thank you again for this opportunity to discuss the 
FBI's efforts to eradicate the threat posed by transnational gangs. I 
look forward to answering any questions you may have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Mr. King [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Richardson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;First of all, let me express my regret for not being here 
on time. We had a meeting of the Intelligence Committee, which 
went over time. But I want to thank all the witnesses for their 
testimony up to now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;I want to thank Mr. Perry for filling in for me. I am sure 
he did a far better job than I would have. Of course thank the 
Ranking Member for her support in putting this hearing 
together.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;So thank you, Mr. Richardson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Our second witness now is Mr. Raymond Villanueva, the 
assistant director for International Operations with Homeland 
Security Investigations at U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement. He began his law enforcement career in 1994 with 
the Puerto Rico Police Department.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Since joining Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Mr. 
Villanueva has served in numerous key positions, including 
group supervisor for the Financial Crimes Asset Forfeiture and 
Removal Group from Buffalo, New York, section chief of the 
Illicit Finance and Proceeds Crime Unit in Washington, DC, 
assistant special agent in charge for the HSI San Juan office 
and most recently as a deputy assistant director for HSI 
international operations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Mr. Villanueva has more than 22 years of law enforcement 
experience.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Richardson "&gt;Let me just say that with the situation we have in Long 
Island with MS-13, HSI has been invaluable. Through you thank 
all of them for the great job they are doing in conjunction 
with the FBI. It has just been, again, phenomenal cooperation 
and also working with the local police in Suffolk County and 
Nassau County. It has been extraordinary. So I thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF RAYMOND VILLANUEVA, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN CHARGE,&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="RAYMOND VILLANUEVA"&gt;Mr. Villanueva, you are now recognized for your testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="RAYMOND VILLANUEVA"&gt;    INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Villanueva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;Thank you, Chairman King. Mr. Perry, thank
you for starting the hearing and Ranking Member Rice, and 
distinguished Members. Thank you for the opportunity to appear 
before you today to discuss U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations with efforts to 
investigate, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal 
organizations or TCOs, to include violent gangs in the United 
States and abroad.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;HSI utilizes its broad legal authorities to investigate 
immigration and customs violations across several programmatic 
areas, including investigating and dismantling TCOs and gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;During the last two decades, transnational organized crime 
has expanded dramatically, which poses a significant threat to 
National security.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;We take this threat very seriously and target TCOs at every 
critical location in the cycle by utilizing a layered approach 
that is internationally by pushing our borders out in 
cooperation with foreign counterparts where transnational 
criminal and terrorist organizations operate at our Nation's 
border, in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, CBP, where the transportation cells attempt to 
exploit America's legitimate trade, travel, and transportation 
systems and in cities throughout the United States where 
criminal organizations earn substantial profits off their 
illicit activities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;As of December 28, 2017 we maintain over 100 open 
investigations targeting MS-13 members and their criminal 
organization throughout all the United States and abroad by 
working with our law enforcement partners, including those in 
countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;Without our information sharing and partnering with our 
Federal, State, local and foreign law enforcement partners, HSI 
would not be nearly as successful at battling MS-13 and other 
gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;In response to the gang epidemic in 2005, ICE initiated 
Operation Community Shield, which combines HSI and Enforcement 
and Removal Operations, ERO, expansive criminal and civil 
enforcement authorities, as well as our partnerships with law 
enforcement stakeholders, domestically and abroad.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;Through this platform, HSI executes on the gang initiative, 
including specialized urban response gang enforcement, known as 
search operations. Since inception, HSI and its partner 
agencies have made over 60,000 criminal and administrative 
arrests of gang leaders, members, and associates, including 
more than 7,900 MS-13s.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;HSI's most recent search operation, Project New Dawn, the 
largest gang search to date, resulted in 1,378 arrests. At the 
same time, we pursue domestic criminal investigations. We 
continue to push the borders out by capitalizing on our 
international partnerships with foreign law enforcement 
officials.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;This is accomplished by our attache network located in 67 
offices around the world. Our attaches leverage several key 
international partnerships, to include the Transnational 
Criminal Investigative Units, the TCIUs, and Operation CITADEL 
to identify potential bad actors along the illicit pathways 
while exploiting available information with the goal of 
identifying a known gang posing a threat to the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;HSI also leverages information-sharing capabilities through 
the use of several key initiatives, some of which I would like 
to highlight briefly. The Visa Security Program, through this 
program we partner with CBP and Department of State by 
deploying trained special agents to high-risk visa-issuing 
posts to identify and investigate potential terrorist and 
criminal threats before they reach the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;The Trade Transparency Units, the TTUs are designed to 
aggressively target organizations and individuals involved in 
trade-based money laundering and also those involved in 
contraband smuggling and customs fraud. All TTU foreign 
partners, 16 today, recognize the value of information sharing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;Last but not least, the Biometric Identification Migrant 
Alert Program, what we call BITMAP. This program helps provide 
infrastructure and capability for host governments to collect 
biometric data on individuals they encounter.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;We and CBP's National targeting center then share 
information back with our foreign partners. Through this 
process we are able to track movement toward the United States, 
take joint action with partner nations along the route and 
deter human smuggling through South and Central America. BITMAP 
is deployed to 14 countries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;These operational endeavors would not have been possible 
without the cooperation of our Federal, State, local, and 
foreign law enforcement partners, including the support 
provided by the Department of State through its country team 
and their Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement 
Affairs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Villaneuva follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you 
today and for your continued support of ICE and our law 
enforcement mission. I am looking forward to answering any 
questions you may have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Prepared Statement of Raymond Villanueva&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;January 18, 2018&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Chairman King, Ranking Member Rice, and distinguished Members: 
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the 
mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), its efforts 
to identify, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal 
organizations (TCOs), to include transnational gangs, drug cartels, and 
smugglers, and its information-sharing initiatives dedicated to 
combatting the aforementioned threats. ICE enforces approximately 400 
Federal laws governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration 
to promote homeland security and public safety. With more than 20,000 
employees and more than 400 offices across the United States and in 50 
countries, the men and women of ICE execute our mission humanely, 
professionally, and always in accordance with the law. ICE has three 
operational directorates: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), 
Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), and the Office of the 
Principal Legal Advisor. As a senior executive of ICE/HSI, I serve as 
the assistant director of ICE/HSI International Operations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;As the largest investigative component in the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS), ICE/HSI protects U.S. borders by conducting 
multi-faceted, international law enforcement operations, and by 
partnering with foreign and domestic counterparts to combat criminal 
organizations and prevent terrorist activities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;ICE/HSI International Operations has a network of over 400 
personnel, including over 180 special agents deployed to 67 attache 
offices in 50 countries, who conduct investigations against TCOs, 
terrorist, and other criminal organizations that threaten our National 
security. ICE/HSI leverages its international footprint and 
partnerships to disrupt and dismantle TCOs that seek to exploit 
America's legitimate trade, travel, and financial systems, and enforces 
U.S. customs and immigration laws at and beyond our Nation's borders to 
prevent threats from entering the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;ICE/HSI manages several strategic/information sharing initiatives, 
which include:
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit (TCIU)
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Program (BITMAP)
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Visa Security Program (VSP)
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Trade Transparency Units (TTUs)&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;HSI, domestically and abroad, focuses on critical investigative 
areas, which include:
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; National security
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Counter-proliferation of arms and controlled technology
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Human smuggling and trafficking
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Financial crimes
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Child exploitation
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Commercial fraud and intellectual property
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Anti-Gang Enforcement
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Narcotics
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Identity and Benefit Fraud
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Worksite Enforcement
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Cyber
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Human Rights Violators and War Crimes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;ICE/ERO identifies, arrests, and removes aliens who present a 
danger to National security or are a risk to public safety, as well as 
those who enter the United States illegally, or otherwise undermine the 
integrity of U.S. immigration laws and border control efforts. ERO 
upholds America's immigration laws at, within, and beyond its borders 
through efficient enforcement and removal operations. ERO also develops 
investigative leads and provides support in locating and arresting 
foreign nationals wanted for crimes committed abroad who are now at-
large in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;ERO removal operations require complex coordination, management, 
and facilitation efforts to successfully remove or return aliens from 
the United States to their country of origin. ERO has enforcement 
officers strategically deployed to 19 locations around the world and 
leverages resources available through foreign law enforcement partners, 
including INTERPOL, EUROPOL, and the HSI Attache corps.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;combatting transnational criminal organizations&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;ICE utilizes its broad legal authorities to investigate immigration 
and customs violations, including those related to export control, 
human rights abuses, narcotics, weapons and contraband smuggling, 
financial crime, cyber crime, human trafficking and smuggling, child 
exploitation, intellectual property theft, transnational gangs, 
immigration document and benefit fraud, and worksite enforcement. ICE 
is grateful for continued Congressional support that allows ICE to 
maintain critical operations at home and abroad and increase our 
efforts to target and combat dangerous transnational gangs and other 
criminal organizations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;During fiscal year 2017, ICE investigations led to the disruption 
or dismantlement of TCOs with more than 32,958 criminal arrests, 
including arrests of more than 4,818 transnational gang members. ICE 
also seized 981,586 pounds of narcotics, made 1,205 seizures for 
violations of U.S. export laws and regulations, and seized nearly $307 
million in currency and monetary instruments. Additionally, ICE 
identified and assisted 518 human trafficking victims and more than 904 
child exploitation victims.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;During the last two decades, transnational organized crime has 
expanded dramatically in size, scope, and impact, which poses a 
significant threat to National security. ICE takes very seriously this 
threat, and targets TCOs at every critical location in the cycle: 
Internationally, in cooperation with foreign counterparts, where 
transnational criminal and terrorist organizations operate; at our 
Nation's physical border and ports of entry, in coordination with U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP), where the transportation cells 
attempt to exploit America's legitimate trade, travel, and 
transportation systems; and in cities throughout the United States, 
where criminal organizations earn substantial profits off their illicit 
activities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;As directed by the President's Executive Order 13773, Enforcing 
Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and 
Preventing International Trafficking, ICE will continue to give a high 
priority and devote sufficient resources to dismantling TCOs and 
subsidiary organizations. ICE will continue to focus on cooperative 
work with other Federal agencies, as well as with foreign counterparts, 
by sharing intelligence and law enforcement information when 
appropriate and permitted by law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;joint task forces&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;In 2014, the Department announced its new Unity of Effort 
Initiative and directed our Department-wide Southern Border and 
Approaches Campaign (SBAC) Plan. The SBAC is part of a comprehensive 
security strategy designed to unify efforts across DHS components to 
address threats specifically associated with terrorism, illicit market-
driven flows, and illegal migration across our Southern Border and 
Approaches. In furtherance of the SBAC, the Department commissioned 
three Joint Task Forces (JTFs) in November 2014. The three Joint Task 
Forces, JTF-East (JTF-E), JTF-West (JTF-W), and JTF-Investigations 
(JTF-I), are responsible for establishing operational priorities and 
synchronizing capabilities in order to achieve SBAC objectives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Two of the JTFs, JTF-E and JTF-W, are geographically focused task 
forces that concentrate on the southern land and maritime borders and 
approaches to the United States all the way to Central and South 
America. JTF-I is a ``functional'', multi-component task force that 
employs National Case Management to identify and prioritize top TCOs 
affecting homeland security, manage investigations and operations to 
dismantle them, and identify weaknesses or gaps in our practices, 
technology, etc.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;To address these gaps, JTF-I created and implemented HOMECORT 
(Homeland Criminal Organization Target), the DHS-wide process for 
identifying and prioritizing the top criminal networks affecting 
homeland security.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;In order to manage and unify U.S. Government efforts against these 
HOMECORT criminal networks, JTF-I developed three complementary 
processes:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;1. National Case Management to manage, integrate and support all&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;the investigations and operations related to the targeted&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;criminal network;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;2. Comprehensive Criminal Network Analysis to provide knowledge of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;the criminal network; and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;3. Integrated Action Planning to establish the business rules for&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Criminal Network Analysis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Through the sharing and fusing of each other's information, these 
JTF-I processes allow DHS components to:
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Identify and prioritize the top criminal networks impacting&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;homeland security;
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Tie together and manage all the investigations, operations,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;arrests, and seizures (covering multiple countries,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;jurisdictions, areas of responsibility and programs) related to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;all the activities (smuggling, money laundering, corruption,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;etc.) of a criminal network (see complementary processes&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;below);
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Move toward a complex common goal through a formal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;integrated action planning process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Since its inception, JTF-I's interagency delegates managed and 
supported the targeting of 21 HOMECORT criminal networks, comprised of 
more than a thousand criminal investigations. To date, 13 of those 
networks were dismantled to the point they no longer threaten homeland 
security. The networks include money launderers, human smugglers, sex 
traffickers, drug smugglers, bulk cash smugglers, and weapons 
smugglers. The remaining HOMECORT-designated criminal networks continue 
to be the targets of active criminal investigations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Another example of a successful joint task force model is the 
Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) initiative. BEST teams 
are ICE-led, multiagency task forces that target illicit movement of 
people and contraband through border areas. Other DHS entities, 
particularly CBP and the United States Coast Guard, participate. There 
are 38 BEST teams on the U.S.-Canada border and U.S.-Mexico border. 
Canadian and Mexican (multiagency) law enforcement partners work 
directly with DHS and other U.S. counterparts on investigative and 
interdiction missions. Canadian officials are often cross-designated as 
U.S. law enforcement (U.S. Code: Title 19) to promote full sharing of 
law enforcement information. These units are housed on the U.S. side of 
the border. In fiscal year 2017, the BEST teams initiated 4,034 
investigations and effected 4,967 criminal arrests.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;national gang unit&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;The National Gang Unit (NGU) is a critical part of ICE's mission to 
bring the fight to transnational criminal gangs. The NGU identifies and 
develops intelligence on gang membership, associations, activities, and 
international movements. It also deters and disrupts gang operations by 
tracing and seizing cash, weapons, and other assets derived from 
illicit activities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;In 2005, ICE initiated Operation Community Shield, an international 
law enforcement initiative that combines ICE's expansive statutory and 
civil enforcement authorities to combat the growth and proliferation of 
transnational criminal street gangs, prison gangs, and outlaw 
motorcycle gangs throughout the United States. With assistance from 
State, local, Tribal, and foreign law enforcement partners, the 
initiative helps ICE locate, investigate, prosecute, and where 
applicable, immediately remove gang members from our neighborhoods and 
ultimately from the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Operation Community Shield has resulted in the criminal and 
administrative arrests of nearly 60,000 gang leaders, members, and 
associates since its inception. Among those arrests, Community Shield 
operations have resulted in the criminal and administrative arrests of 
over 7,800 leaders, members, and associates of Mara Salvatrucha-13 (MS-
13), the international criminal street gang.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;In 2012, ICE worked with the Treasury Department Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC) to designate MS-13 as a TCO, the first criminal 
street gang so designated. As a result of the designation, any property 
or property interests in the United States, or in the possession or 
control of U.S. persons in which MS-13 has an interest, are blocked. In 
addition, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions 
with MS-13 and are subject to civil monetary penalties up to $250,000 
and imprisonment up to 20 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;In 2016, ICE utilized the 2012 OFAC designation to develop and 
implement a new strategy targeting MS-13. ICE recognizes that TCOs need 
funding to maintain and expand their criminal organization and has been 
successfully identifying, exploiting, and disrupting MS-13's global 
financial networks. Part of ICE's new strategy is to address the 
threats posed by MS-13 in the United States and at their command-and-
control structure in El Salvador simultaneously. Since January 2016, 
ICE has been deploying special agents to El Salvador to work with our 
host country law enforcement partners to build their financial 
investigative capacity to combat MS-13 and identify MS-13's financial 
networks within El Salvador. In addition, the deployment allows the 
free flow of actionable intelligence between ICE and our host country 
law enforcement partners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;In 2017, ICE worked with our DHS partners to form a departmental 
MS-13 Working Group, to include ICE, CBP, U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Department of Justice's Bureau of 
Prisons (BOP). The DHS MS-13 Working Group was formed to share 
intelligence, bridge intelligence gaps, eliminate redundancies, enhance 
collaboration, and provide visibility to all DHS entities involved in 
the fight against MS-13. The ultimate goal of the DHS MS-13 Working 
Group is to develop and implement a DHS enterprise enforcement strategy 
to disrupt and dismantle MS-13's global criminal networks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;As of December 28, 2017, ICE maintains 107 open investigations 
targeting MS-13 members and their criminal organizations globally, 
including Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, the District 
of Columbia, North Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Ohio, California, 
Washington, and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, 
and El Salvador through Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
(RICO), Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering (VICAR), and criminal 
conspiracy prosecutions. Without information sharing and partnering 
with our Federal, State, local, and foreign law enforcement partners, 
ICE would not be nearly as successful at battling MS-13 and other 
gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;law enforcement information-sharing efforts&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;In addition to leveraging domestic assets, ICE uses its 
strategically deployed personnel around the globe to use established 
relationships with host country law enforcement officials and 
mechanisms such as Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements (CMAAs) to 
share information and further its investigations. Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaties (MLATs) are also invaluable instruments in 
obtaining and receiving international legal assistance, including 
evidence, for criminal investigations and prosecutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;ICE International Operations also partners with TCIUs and 
international task forces in 12 countries around the world. TCIUs are 
comprised of foreign law enforcement officials, customs officers, 
immigration officers, and prosecutors who receive ICE training and 
undergo a strict vetting process to ensure that shared information and 
operational activities are not compromised. Partnering with these TCIUs 
enables ICE to promote direct action via information sharing and 
investigative leads while respecting the sovereignty of the host 
country and cultivating international partnerships.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Aligned with the President's Strategy in Combatting Transnational 
Organized Crime, TCIUs identify targets, collect evidence, share 
intelligence, and facilitate the prosecution of TCOs both in-country 
and in the United States. These efforts, which often occur thousands of 
miles from the U.S. borders, essentially act as an outer layer of 
security for the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Another ICE program, BITMAP, helps provide infrastructure and 
capability for host governments to collect biometric data on 
individuals they encounter. This information is shared with U.S. law 
enforcement and the intelligence community; DHS in turn provides 
information back to these countries about these individuals. Through 
this process, ICE is able to track movement toward the United States, 
take joint action with partner nations along the route, and deter human 
smuggling through South and Central America. Comparisons of biometric 
data through BITMAP serve to identify criminal persons, wanted subjects 
(including international fugitives), and known or suspected terrorists. 
BITMAP is currently deployed to 14 countries, with near-term plans to 
expand to two additional countries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;ICE also leverages its information-sharing capabilities through the 
use of the Visa Security Program (VSP) and Trade Transparency Units 
(TTU). VSP deploys trained ICE special agents abroad to high-risk visa 
activity posts to identify and investigate potential terrorist and 
criminal threats before they reach the United States. VSP contributes 
to both counter-flow and counter-network capabilities, as well as 
providing support for intelligence, interdiction, and engagement. VSP 
special agents work alongside Department of State Consular Officers to 
provide real-time feedback on visa applicants prior to visa 
adjudication. VSP agents receive referrals based on automated screening 
of U.S. visa applicants conducted by ICE, in cooperation with CBP.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;The core mission of the TTU is to aggressively target criminal 
organizations and individuals involved in trade-based money laundering 
(TBML) but also those perpetrating contraband smuggling and customs 
fraud. In order to achieve this mission, HSI reached out to key foreign 
trading partners and successfully established (16) TTUs abroad. TTU 
currently has partnerships with Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, 
Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, France, Guatemala, 
Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, United Kingdom, and Uruguay. These 
countries are highly dependent upon value-added taxes (VAT) on 
commodities, which served as a motivating factor in the establishment 
of TTUs. These foreign partners recognize the value of information 
sharing, which permits the comparison of international trade and cross-
border movement of merchandise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;The United States and its foreign TTU partners currently provide 
trade data which that allows HSI investigators and analysts to detect 
anomalies which may be indicative of criminal activity such as TBML, 
contraband smuggling, and trade/customs fraud. This information sharing 
allows for the cross-referencing of trade data with other pertinent 
information such as Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reports. The ultimate goal 
of most criminal organizations is financial gain either to promote on-
going illicit activity or as the finality of this activity, hence 
trade-based money laundering is often the primary means by which they 
launder proceeds for their criminal enterprises.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;ICE's Law Enforcement Information-Sharing Initiative (LEISI) serves 
as an active advocate in support of law enforcement information sharing 
both internal and external to DHS. This includes information sharing 
between Federal, State, local, Tribal, territorial, and foreign 
partners. LEISI coordinates throughout the law enforcement community to 
improve the understanding of information needs, provide leadership in 
resolving policy issues that may inhibit law enforcement information 
sharing, and develop approaches to overcome traditional barriers to 
information sharing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;The LEISI program provides program management support and oversight 
to include administration of the Law Enforcement Information Sharing 
Strategy. For fiscal year 2018, additional focus is on international 
information for initiatives such as: Preventing and Combatting Serious 
Crimes (PCSC), the Five Country Ministerial (FCM), the Five Country 
Conference (FCC), and ERO's Criminal History Information Sharing (CHIS) 
program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;CHIS is a DHS-led initiative between the United States and its 
international partners whose purpose is to provide participating 
nations with criminal history information in advance of an alien's 
removal. In turn, foreign countries share their information with the 
United States. The information shared helps protect law enforcement 
personnel, regional security, and public safety officers all over the 
globe. The initiative supports efforts in immigration management, law 
enforcement and National security. Countries currently participating in 
the CHIS initiative are: Mexico, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, the 
Bahamas, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, with planned expansion 
to additional countries in fiscal year 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;CHIS enables ICE to identify wanted felons, including gang members, 
who fled to the United States to avoid prosecution in their home 
countries. Without this initiative, dangerous criminals might be able 
to circumvent prosecution. In fiscal year 2017, CHIS sent 84,067 
outbound notices of removal and ICE's foreign partners returned 21,434 
positive responses, including 2,810 foreign criminal history records, 
93 foreign criminal warrants and information related to 199 
transnational gang members.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;During fiscal year 2017, ICE achieved significant successes in 
Latin America and the Caribbean through the development of programs 
that bolstered the law enforcement, customs, and immigration 
enforcement capabilities of international partners. These successes 
included the joint interagency execution of Operation CITADEL, which 
focused efforts on building partner nation capacity in identifying, 
disrupting and dismantling TCOs, including those designated as drug 
trafficking organizations and terrorist support networks. Interagency 
information sharing and collaboration from agencies within DHS, the 
Department of State, the Department of Justice (including the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation), and the Department of Defense, as well as 
participating partner nations, has been an essential piece of Operation 
CITADEL's efforts to build capacity and to address identified threats. 
Operation CITADEL provided resources to enhance foreign partners' 
investigative capabilities to counter transnational threats and 
organized crime that, in turn, provided ICE the ability to expand 
domestic and international investigations well beyond the U.S. borders 
and to more effectively target the illicit pathways exploited by TCOs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;In fiscal year 2017, the Operation CITADEL effected the training of 
809 partner national personnel, 231 criminal arrests, 54 indictments, 9 
convictions, 2,005 BITMAP enrollments, seizure of $252,235 in currency, 
18,224 pounds of narcotics, seizure of 27 firearms, and encountered 
3,669 aliens of possible National security concern.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;conclusion&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today and 
for your continued support of DHS and ICE and their missions. ICE is 
committed to continuing its successful practice of sharing information 
with domestic and foreign partners and leveraging its resources around 
the world to stem cross-border criminal organizations. I appreciate 
your interest in these important issues and the efforts I have 
discussed today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Villaneuva "&gt;    I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Villanueva for your
testimony and for your service.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Our final witness is Mr. Richard H. Glenn, the acting 
deputy assistant secretary for the Bureau of International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs in the State Department.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Mr. Glenn oversees his department's air wing and is 
responsible for foreign assistance programs in the Western 
Hemisphere that combat illicit drugs and organized crime and 
support law enforcement and the rule of law. Mr. Glenn began 
working with International Narcotics and Law Enforcement 
Affairs in 2011 in Mexico City, implementing the Merida 
Initiative.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Since joining the State Department as a foreign service 
officer in 1999, Mr. Glenn has served in Ecuador, South Africa, 
Czech Republic, Argentina, and Mexico.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF RICHARD H. GLENN, ACTING DEPUTY ASSISTANT&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="RICHARD H. GLENN"&gt;    Mr. Glenn, you are recognized for your testimony. Thank you 
very much for being here today.
SECRETARY, BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL NARCOTIC, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Good morning, Chairman King, Ranking Member
Rice, Members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to be here this morning to share with you the 
Department of State's work to combat transnational gangs, 
primarily through information sharing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement 
Affairs, INL as we know it, leads the Department's efforts to 
combat crime overseas. We strengthen the capacity of foreign 
partners to mitigate crime before it reaches our borders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Our neighbors, particularly Central America's Northern 
Triangle, suffer extortion, violence, and instability carried 
out by gangs like MS-13. Gang activity in the region undermines 
institutions. It drives migration and it threatens citizen 
security. This has a direct bearing on our own National 
security.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Like other forms of transnational crime, combatting gangs 
requires well-coordinated and comprehensive solutions. INL 
approaches this threat abroad on three fronts: First through 
regional coordination and information sharing through vetted 
and specialized units; No. 2, community anti-gang efforts; and 
third through institutional reform and capacity building of our 
foreign partners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;INL support to vetted and specialized units provides U.S. 
and partner National law enforcement with the tools they need 
to investigate complex and high-threat gang cases. Through our 
support, foreign law enforcement gains the skills necessary to 
become reliable, trusted partners of U.S. law enforcement, 
routinely sharing information to disrupt the work of 
transnational gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;We support 56 specialized units throughout Central America, 
including FBI's TAG units and ICE's TCIUs. In 2016 alone the 
Northern Triangle and the vetted units that we support made 
3,116 arrests and denied more than $200 million in revenue to 
criminal organizations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Because gangs are transnational I cannot overstate the 
importance of strong regional coordination. We must be nimble 
and INL continually evolves its approach. INL and FBI develop 
the regional criminal gang intelligence platform to enable 
real-time information flow between TAG units.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Last May, INL, with the Department of Homeland Security, 
created the Border Immigration and Coordination Center, which 
we call GCIF, a Salvadoran multi-agency task force to help 
U.S., State, and local authorities identify, arrest, or deny 
entry to gang members.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;To date, GCIF has identified 240 MS-13 members not 
previously known to U.S. law enforcement, 46 not previously 
known to Salvadoran authorities and 37 Salvadoran human 
smugglers and facilitators.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Just in the last 2 weeks GCIF identified 16 Salvadoran gang 
members, four of which had active arrest warrants in El 
Salvador for crimes, including aggravated homicide. They will 
be processed for deportation and returned to Salvadoran law 
enforcement authorities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;INL is working to expand GCIF offices in El Salvador to 
include Guatemala, Honduran, and Mexican authorities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;We also work closely with our partners in Mexico through 
the Merida Initiative to strengthen our shared border security 
and to combat transnational crime through enhanced information 
sharing. Through INL support, in partnership with DHS, 
biometric information Mexico collects at their borders and 
ports is now being shared with the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;This capability enhances our countries' joint efforts to 
respond to migration trends and to conduct cross-border 
investigations of gang members and special interest aliens.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;We recognize, however, improving operational coordination 
and information sharing is not enough. Citizens need to have 
the trust and confidence in police to report crimes and police 
need that information to successfully crack down on gang 
activity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;In Central America, INL is strengthening local law 
enforcement's capacity to connect with communities and address 
gang violence by implementing violence prevention programs in 
high-crime areas, many of which have seen homicide rates plunge 
between 40 percent and 73 percent in 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;INL's third line of effort supports building strong 
institutions. Arresting gang members is only effective if 
justice institutions can prosecute, convict, and incarcerate 
criminals. INL and our interagency partners enhance the 
capacity of justice institutions, including attorney generals 
to introduce legal reforms, mitigate gang violence, and combat 
corruption.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Combatting transnational gangs requires comprehensive and 
well-coordinated efforts. Achieving lasting change is not quick 
or easy, but the comprehensive approach we have put in place is 
showing promising results. And a sustained commitment to our 
partners in the region is critical to protecting our homeland.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Glenn follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Chairman King, Ranking Member Rice, thank you for the 
opportunity to appear before you today, and I look forward to 
your questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Prepared Statement of Richard H. Glenn&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;January 18, 2018&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Chairman King, Ranking Member Rice, distinguished Members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today 
to discuss the work of the Department of State's Bureau of 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) to combat 
transnational gangs, including through information sharing. 
Transnational gangs are key drivers of instability throughout the 
Western Hemisphere, posing significant threats to security and 
prosperity here in the United States and to our partners abroad, 
particularly in Central America. Transnational gangs extort individuals 
and small businesses and perpetuate high levels of violence and crime, 
causing large numbers of Central Americans, particularly in the 
Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, to 
migrate to the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Gangs, predominantly Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the 18th Street 
Gang, which originated in Los Angeles in the 1980's, continue to 
forcibly recruit vulnerable Central American immigrants and expand 
their influence in the United States. With a presence in more than 40 
U.S. States, communities across the country are forced to grapple with 
increased levels of homicide, extortion, local drug dealing, 
prostitution, and other violent crimes carried out by gangs. MS-13 is 
particularly prevalent in El Salvador, contributing to its notoriety as 
one of the most violent countries in the world in 2015 and 2016. While 
El Salvador's homicide rate for 2017 decreased by 25 percent from 2016 
levels, gang activity still contributes to sustained levels of 
extortion, violence, and insecurity. U.S. law enforcement reports more 
frequent communication between MS-13 members in El Salvador and the 
United States, further reinforcing the growing transnational nature of 
MS-13. Both MS-13 and Barrio 18 have a significant presence in 
Honduras, though not on the same scale as in El Salvador. In Guatemala, 
gang activity consists mainly of street gangs focused on extortion. 
However, transnational gang members, especially Barrio 18, are 
increasingly extending operations in Guatemala as El Salvador and 
Honduras intensify efforts to combat gangs in their respective 
countries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;As the reach of transnational gangs span borders and communities, 
successfully dismantling them require comprehensive and well-
coordinated solutions at the local, State, Federal, and international 
levels. INL leads the Department of State's efforts to combat 
transnational crime overseas by strengthening the capacity of foreign 
partners to combat and prevent crime at the source before it reaches 
U.S. borders. Our programs complement those of, and are closely 
coordinated with, the efforts of our U.S. interagency colleagues, 
including the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the U.S. Department 
of Homeland Security (DHS).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;In Central America, INL leads the Department's implementation of 
regional efforts to combat transnational crime under the Central 
America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) and in support of the U.S. 
Strategy for Central America, a multi-year interagency initiative to 
secure U.S. borders and protect U.S. citizens by addressing the 
security, governance, and economic drivers of migration and illicit 
trafficking, and to promote private-sector investment in Central 
America. Established in 2008, CARSI brings years of lessons learned and 
best practices to the current fight against transnational gangs, 
including the knowledge that combatting MS-13 and other transnational 
gangs requires a multi-faceted approach that couples law enforcement 
efforts to deny transnational gangs the ability to operate with 
building stronger, more accountable institutions that bring criminals 
to justice. To this end, INL support under CARSI focuses on 
strengthening the capacity of foreign governments' law enforcement and 
criminal justice systems through a three-part approach: Regional 
coordination and information sharing through vetted and specialized 
units, bottom-up community anti-gang efforts, and top-down 
institutional reform and capacity building. Through this approach, we 
prevent gang activity and recruitment in Central American communities, 
ensure institutions are capable of bringing gang members to justice, 
and strengthen the ability of partner-nation law enforcement to disrupt 
and dismantle transnational gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Our Northern Triangle partners are also working to enhance their 
efforts to disrupt and dismantle transnational crime. In August 2016, 
the Northern Triangle governments signed the ``Regional Plan Against 
Transnational Organized Crime''. The agreement includes measures for 
information sharing on organized crime investigations and increased 
joint patrolling of border zones by police and military personnel to 
curb arms and drug smuggling, as well as the movement of gang members. 
As part of this plan, high-level officials, including the Attorney 
Generals, meet to increase collaboration and coordination between the 
countries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;regional coordination and information sharing&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Working closely with our interagency colleagues, including DoJ and 
DHS, INL combats transnational gangs through building the capacity of 
vetted units and specialized task forces to investigate cases and to 
serve as reliable, trusted partners of U.S. law enforcement. Due to the 
transnational nature of MS-13 and Barrio 18, our efforts increasingly 
focus on enhancing cross-border intelligence sharing and operations. We 
currently support 56 partner nation vetted units, task forces, and 
specialized tactical units throughout Central America. These units, 
typically comprised of elite members of partner nation law enforcement 
institutions, are capable of investigating complex and high-threat gang 
cases and other key security issues. In Honduras, El Salvador, and 
Guatemala, INL provides training, equipment, technology, and logistical 
support to FBI-vetted and advised Transnational Anti-Gang Units (TAGs), 
which lead international efforts to target criminal gangs. Through the 
TAGs, U.S. and Central American law enforcement partners work together 
to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle transnational gangs, including 
through the collection and dissemination of intelligence to support 
investigations. The results of these units have been remarkable and, 
importantly, have led to arrests in both the United States and Central 
America, and to lives saved. In 2015 the TAG unit in El Salvador 
started monitoring Salvadorans with active links to gang members 
throughout the East Coast of the United States, which contributed to 
the identification of the entire leadership structure for local MS-13 
and 18th Street gangs and the arrest of 98 MS-13 gang members in 
Charlotte, Boston, and Newark, saving four lives in the United States 
and 28 in El Salvador.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;To enhance TAG units' ability to attack criminal gang activity in 
the region, INL supported the development of the Regional Criminal Gang 
Intelligence Platform (SICAT), which was operationalized in October 
2017. INL continues to support SICAT, which enables real-time 
information sharing for TAG units to track gang-related activities, 
migration, human smuggling, and the trafficking of drugs, weapons, and 
illicit goods across the Northern Triangle. The platform facilitates 
secure and immediate exchange of information, directly supporting the 
Northern Triangle Presidents agreement in the 2016 ``Regional Plan 
Against Transnational Organized Crime'' to exchange information on 
transnational gang activity. SICAT is a critical component for 
increased cross-border coordination and operations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;In the Northern Triangle and Panama, INL supports U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-vetted Transnational Criminal 
Investigative Units (TCIUs) through the provision of equipment and 
technology, training, and logistical support. TCIUs disrupt and 
dismantle transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and investigate a 
litany of crimes, including human trafficking, smuggling, and money 
laundering, which often have a nexus with transnational gangs. Our 
support for TCIUs includes DHS Operation CITADEL, a multi-year 
interagency effort to bolster partner nation capabilities to identify, 
disrupt, and dismantle TCOs by targeting the networks used to move 
migrants, illicit funds, and contraband throughout Central America. In 
2017, CITADEL's intelligence and information sharing, mentoring, and 
capacity building through cross-border TCIU operations resulted in 231 
arrests, including nine MS-13 members in Honduras. CITADEL also led 
authorities to identify or disrupt a number of human trafficking and 
financial networks of gangs and TCOs in the region.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Extortion is the main source of revenue for Salvadoran gangs. Wide-
spread extortion perpetuated by gangs is often cited as a primary 
security concern by citizens of the Northern Triangle and one of the 
drivers of migration from the region. As a result, INL established 
several specialized task forces beginning in 2012 comprised of police 
and prosecutors to address extortion and dismantle transnational gangs' 
extensive financial networks. Through technical assistance and 
mentoring by INL and DOJ Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development 
Assistance and Training (OPDAT) advisors, investigations by these task 
forces have produced impressive results. In 2017, asset forfeiture and 
financial crimes task forces executed numerous large-scale operations 
with hundreds of arrests and multi-million-dollar asset seizures of 
gang members and associates, eliminating access to their financial 
resources. For example, the Salvadoran Business Crimes Task Force 
(BCTF) successfully dismantled four MS-13 and 18th Street extortion 
networks, maintaining a 96 percent conviction rate. In 2016, these 
units contributed to Operation Jaque, El Salvador's first effort to 
dismantle MS-13 financial structures. The Salvadoran Attorney General's 
Office expanded the BCTF concept to anti-extortion units located in 
each of El Salvador's 19 departments. In September 2017, the units 
executed a second MS-13 financial takedown, Operation Tecana, which 
involved cross-border coordination with Guatemala and DHS, resulting in 
137 arrests, including six police officers, for collaborating with MS-
13 and other criminal organizations and the seizure of properties and 
businesses used to launder money from illicit acts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;In September 2017, INL and interagency efforts to more effectively 
coordinate the network of Northern Triangle task forces and vetted 
units contributed to the success of Operation Regional Shield. INL-
supported prosecutors and police in Guatemala, Honduras, and El 
Salvador, working with OPDAT and the FBI, conducted a coordinated 
regional operation against gang members in their respective countries. 
The operation led to the arrest of 3,800 gang members in the United 
States and Central America. Law enforcement officials seized six 
firearms and charged 284 gang members in Guatemala; seized 14 
businesses and 11 luxury vehicles and arrested 12 MS-13 money 
launderers in Honduras; and filed 3,477 criminal charges, resulting in 
more than 1,400 arrests and the dismantling of eight MS-13 and Barrio 
18 cliques in El Salvador.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;In May 2017, INL facilitated the creation of the Border Integration 
and Coordination Center (GCIF), a Salvadoran multi-agency task force 
supporting DHS and U.S. State and local law enforcement to identify, 
arrest, or deny entry to gang members. GCIF officials, originally 
deployed to McAllen, Texas, conduct research and report information to 
DHS and relevant law enforcement for further action. The information 
provided through GCIF was not available to U.S. authorities prior to 
the implementation of the program. Since its inception, GCIF 
information has led to the arrest of eight gang members and one human 
smuggler in the United States, as well as the arrest of a gang member 
in Italy who was on Salvadoran authorities' top-wanted criminal list. 
GCIF has identified 240 MS-13 members not previously known to U.S. law 
enforcement, 46 not previously known to Salvadoran authorities, and 37 
Salvadoran human smugglers and facilitators. GCIF queries also 
identified 88 Salvadoran nationals with active arrest warrants in El 
Salvador; information U.S. officials utilized when reviewing 
immigration applications made by these individuals. In December 2017, 
the last Salvadoran officials deployed to McAllen returned to El 
Salvador, joining a permanent staff of 10 police officers, five 
migration officials, and two corrections officers--alongside 
representatives from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security--at a 
dedicated Salvadoran headquarters where they will continue to review 
these records.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Due to the initial successes and strengthened coordination between 
United States and Salvadoran authorities, INL is working to expand GCIF 
to include Guatemalan and Honduran officials. In July 2017, the INL-
funded United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime human trafficking 
project facilitated the first Interparliamentary Forum among 
legislators, Attorneys General, and Security Ministers of the Northern 
Triangle countries. The country delegates concluded the meeting with 
signed commitments, including support for GCIF, the first tangible 
regional commitment to the GCIF by the Northern Triangle governments. 
At the same time, we are working to expand GCIF beyond its current 
location and are promoting it as a resource for U.S. States and local 
jurisdictions with significant MS-13 presence. In October 2017, INL and 
DHS reached out to the Suffolk County, Long Island Police Department 
(SCPD), which submitted to GCIF a list of 454 individuals suspected of 
gang affiliation. GCIF identified and provided potential residential 
locations of known gang members and individuals wanted in El Salvador.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Through INL's International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs), we 
provide specialized training to criminal justice sector officials and 
facilitate collaboration between partner nations' and U.S. Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement to address common problems. From 2015 
through 2017, 211 law enforcement officials from 12 countries, 
including more than 100 from the Northern Triangle, attended anti-gang 
training courses at ILEAs San Salvador and Roswell. The courses were 
taught either by the FBI or Salvadoran National Police to provide 
participants with tools to investigate gang-related crimes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;information sharing with mexico&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Through our strong security partnership with Mexico, INL's efforts 
under the Merida Initiative includes enhancing information sharing with 
Mexico to disrupt transnational crime and TCOs. In 2015, the United 
States agreed to help Mexico develop a nation-wide, interagency 
biometrics system capable of interfacing with U.S. biometrics systems. 
INL, in coordination with DHS, commenced a pilot project in 2017 to 
enable Mexico's National Migration Institute to routinely collect and 
exchange biometric information on migrants with the United States. As 
of 2017, all biometric information collected in migration centers and 
ports of entry along Mexico's southern border with Guatemala and Belize 
is shared with United States law enforcement. This capability enhances 
our countries' joint efforts to identify, track, and dismantle TCOs and 
other violent criminal groups; to identify Known or Suspected 
Terrorists before they reach U.S. borders; to track migration patterns; 
to anticipate, plan for, and respond to migration surges; to analyze 
human trafficking networks; and to support cross-border investigations 
of gang members and other criminals. INL partners with ICE and Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) to train and mentor Mexican migration 
officials. We will explore expanding this biometric exchange with 
Mexico to prisons, airports, and other Mexican security agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;The depth of our cooperation with Mexico to strengthen border 
security, control migration, and dismantle transnational criminal 
networks is unprecedented. Since 2014, Mexico has significantly 
increased its presence along its southern border with Guatemala and 
Belize. In 2016, Mexico's Migration Agency detained 188,595 migrants 
headed to the United States. Ninety percent of those migrants were 
Central Americans, and 17,889 were unaccompanied children. Mexico's 
cooperation to control migration strengthens our own border security 
and saves the United States billions of dollars in potential 
deportation costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Mexico continues to increase engagement with the United States and 
Central American partners to combat shared threats from organized 
crime, and we welcome this very positive step in regional 
collaboration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;bottom-up anti-gang efforts&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;In addition to our bilateral and regional coordination efforts to 
enhance information sharing, INL also implements proven successful 
community-level anti-gang interventions in Central America, given a 
significant amount of gang activity in the region is localized. These 
interventions strengthen the capacity of police, make communities more 
resilient to gang infiltration, and establish trust and relationships 
between communities and the police. Through Model Police Precincts 
(MPP) and Place-Based Strategy (PBS) sites, we strengthen local law 
enforcement's ability to prevent and respond to gang violence by 
identifying key high-crime areas and communities at risk, and 
partnering with implementers to develop strategically balanced and 
integrated criminal justice-sector projects. As a result of these 
strong partnerships, MPP and PBS sites have seen reductions in homicide 
rates ranging from 40 to 73 percent since 2015. We also tackle gang 
recruitment, a pervasive issue for youth in the Northern Triangle 
countries, through the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) 
and Police Athletic League (PAL) programs. These police-led programs 
provide anti-gang and life skills training, sports, and other 
activities to at-risk children. As a result, children develop tools to 
resist recruitment tactics and citizen trust in law enforcement is 
strengthened. To date, more than 300,000 students have graduated from 
INL-sponsored GREAT programs in Central America, and 1,624 police 
officers achieved certification to teach the GREAT curriculum.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;top-down institutional efforts&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;Arresting gang members is only effective if justice institutions 
are capable of prosecuting, convicting, and incarcerating these 
criminals. Through training, technical assistance, and mentoring, INL 
and our interagency partners enhance the capacity of the Northern 
Triangle justice institutions and ensure the security of prosecutors 
and judges working on high-profile cases. These efforts are essential 
as corruption and impunity remain significant challenges in the region. 
We work closely with the Attorney Generals of the Northern Triangle 
countries to introduce legal reforms, mitigate gang violence, and 
combat corruption. Many key successes, including Operation Regional 
Shield executed in September 2017, are coordinated by Northern Triangle 
Attorney Generals, with U.S. support. Furthermore, by helping 
Salvadoran and Guatemalan prisons improve security and infrastructure, 
we work to ensure that gang leaders are unable to direct criminal 
activities while incarcerated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;conclusion&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Glenn "&gt;    Dismantling transnational gangs and ending the violence and crime 
they carry out requires sustained and well-coordinated efforts between 
law enforcement while also strengthening the institutions that 
administer justice and investing in local communities to increase trust 
and confidence in the police and provide citizens with the tools 
necessary to resist gang influence. These are smart and necessary 
investments, whether it is combating transnational gangs here at home 
or abroad. Security in Central America is vital to the security of the 
United States. INL's work to strengthen foreign partner capacity in the 
region provides critical linkages between U.S. and foreign law 
enforcement to make possible greater information sharing. Like other 
forms of transnational crime, however, dismantling gangs does not lend 
itself to simple, short-term solutions. This is a long-term endeavor, 
but the comprehensive approach we have put in place to tackle the 
considerable challenges before us is demonstrating measurable results. 
INL will continue to support programming that enhances information 
sharing and regional coordination to improve citizen security in 
Central America and combat the influence of transnational gangs and 
criminal organizations in the United States.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Glenn.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;    I will direct my first question initially to the FBI but 
then to be answered by anyone who wants to respond. What has 
changed or will change in your ability to target MS-13 since 
the October 2017 attorney general direction to make the TCO a 
priority? OK, that will be the first part of the question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Thank you, sir. Certainly we at the FBI
have redirected resources appropriately. We are actively 
engaged with our TAG teams or our TAG task forces down in the 
Northern Triangle with regard to MS-13 and the 18th Street 
gang.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Ultimately our goal is to get ahead of the threat through 
intelligence sharing and be more proactive as opposed to 
reactive. We rely heavily upon the information that is coming 
out of the Northern Triangle.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;    We have SSAs that are assigned to these vetted teams that 
are trusted advisors providing subject-matter expertise 
regarding investigative techniques that we utilize. Then the 
goal is to gain actionable intelligence and share that with our 
domestic partners, with our trusted Safe Streets partners 
across the United States in order to get ahead of the threat.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; Thank you. Let me, before I go to Mr. Villanueva,
I would be remiss if I didn't also commend the FBI for the 
terrific work they are doing in the--and again, this is HSI, 
FBI and the local police are doing a phenomenal job, and so I 
want to--if you can, again, pass on to them my thanks for the 
terrific job they are doing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt; Yes, sir. I will. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; Now to Mr. Villanueva and Mr. Glenn, as a follow-
on to that question, did this attorney general's direction add 
any capabilities to HSI or to the State Department?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Villanueva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;Sir, what I will say is that the direction
will actually help us to focus on the problem and to double 
down our efforts into targeting MS-13 and other violent gangs 
by bringing all ICE tools to bear, whether it is the criminal 
enforcement side they have through HSI or the administrative 
through ERO.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;But also to bring our traditional financial investigations 
to target their finances, their assets, and to go with a 
holistic approach against this violent gang, also by working 
with CBP, with the interagency and working with INL to bring 
capacity-building efforts to the region very much like the FBI 
is doing to continue to raise that level of awareness and the 
expertise to tackle those violent gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;    So a really important direction. It really helps the 
interagency and the law enforcement community to hone down into 
a terrific problem that is affecting our National security.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; Mr. Glenn.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;I would just echo what Mr. Villanueva mentioned,
as well as the success of our programs relies largely on the 
political will of the countries that we work in. Without that 
political will we can do a tremendous amount of work and have 
very few results.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    When we get high-level engagement, for example, the 
attorney general's engagement with the countries that we work 
in, it sends a very clear signal as to the priorities of the 
United States and helps them internally develop the political 
will that is needed to make these programs successful.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; If I could follow up with you, Mr. Glenn, how is
the McAllen coordination facilitated by INL? How is that 
enhancing the coordination between, say, the police in El 
Salvador and in U.S. communities such as Nassau and Suffolk 
Counties where Miss Rice and I represent?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Sure. So it has been a tremendous development
and a very effective tool, but what it does is it places or has 
placed in El Salvador a law enforcement official who has access 
to their criminal information databases and puts them in 
physical connection with law enforcement authorities in the 
United States and provides us between the two countries an 
avenue with which to share the information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;That is why we have been able to get the results that we 
have gotten. As people have come across the border and been 
apprehended, we can run fingerprints against databases in El 
Salvador.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    So people who have misrepresented who they are, your 
fingerprint doesn't lie, and that is how we have been able to 
actually identify people wanted for murder back in El Salvador 
and been able to deport them and see that they experience 
justice.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Glenn.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Now I will recognize the Ranking Member. But let me just 
say before I formally recognize her, is that Miss Rice has been 
a great partner in all this. We had a joint hearing back in 
Central Islip on MS-13 back in, I guess, May or June, and I 
want to thank her for her cooperation and bipartisan spirit in 
this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;With that, I recognize the Ranking Member.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Miss Rice. Thank you, Chairman King.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;    Mr. Glenn, what are the largest Russian gangs that you have 
come across, and what are the kind of criminal activities that 
they are involved in? How are you trying to combat Russian 
cyber crime?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;So our focus in the Western Hemisphere has been
on Latin American gangs, MS-13, 18th Street. Russian gangs in 
the Western Hemisphere has not been a focus.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;What I can do is take that question back to those who focus 
on Russian law enforcement matters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    Miss Rice. But if you are talking about transnational 
criminal organizations, I mean, the Russians, given what they 
did during the elections last year have to be front and center 
on--I mean, just out of curiosity is there any focus on that at 
all?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    Miss Rice. I am not saying take away from MS-13, but if you 
are looking at transnational criminal organizations I would 
think that the Russians are right up there.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;The focus in the Western Hemisphere has been on
MS-13 and 18th Street.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    Miss Rice. Are you aware of any effort to address Russian--
--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Not in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    Miss Rice [continuing]. Criminal organizations? No.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Not in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    Miss Rice. Well----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Not INL programming.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Miss Rice. OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Mr. Villanueva, there are many undocumented immigrants who 
I am sure you are aware are victims of transnational criminal 
organizations, including MS-13, certainly where Chairman King 
and I are from. They witness crimes committed by gang members, 
but as you know, many of them don't want to come forward 
because they are afraid that they are then going to be taken 
into custody, deported depending on what their status is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    So my question is: You know, it seems that the 
administration's rhetoric and policies toward undocumented 
immigrants have really caused that fear to escalate. So how are 
you as law enforcement agencies, needing information from 
people who are maybe here illegally but are being victimized 
and have information to help you address the criminal 
activities of MS-13 and other gangs, how do you deal with that 
issue?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Villanueva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;Ma'am, thank you very much for the
question. Your point is extremely valid and it is a concern 
that we law enforcement deal with every day. As a matter of 
fact, there are protections for witnesses when they come 
forward to law enforcement, whether they are in the country 
legally or not.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the INA, we can 
provide those individuals with continued presence. That 
authority is delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
which she then delegates that to ICE, which is one of the 
programs that I have overseen of. It is what we call the Parole 
Branch.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;We can work with that community and we can offer 
protections, continued presence, significant public benefit 
paroles and there are some other tools out there to protect 
those individuals from being deported, to protect those 
individuals from violence from those gangs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;So there are protections for them when they come forward to 
law enforcement. When I am saying law enforcement, not only 
ICE, HSI. When they come forward to the FBI we will work with 
our FBI partners to grant those protections to any witness that 
come forward regardless of that person's immigration status.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;    Miss Rice. Has that made it easier for you to get 
information? I mean how do you get the word out that it is OK 
for people to come forward?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Villanueva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;So we do have actually outreach campaigns
through the victim assistance program and certainly efforts 
like this and where we have the ability to talk to the American 
people about all the programs are paramount to get the word 
out, so really appreciate your question on this topic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;Miss Rice. Great, thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;    I think that is it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; Mr. Perry, let me thank you for--articulately and
more intelligently than I would ever do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt; My privilege, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; The gentleman is recognized.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;    Mr. Richardson, a couple questions here kind-of in 
different directions and maybe a little off the topic of 
collaboration, but somewhat in it. Not only transnational 
crimes but if a terrorist activity or event occurs in the 
United States that would be something you would collaborate 
with other agencies on as the FBI. Is that correct? I just want 
to make sure I am not out of bounds here.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt; Yes. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt; That is correct, right? So if I could, what
compels your organization or local law enforcement for that 
matter to work with the National Counterterrorism Center in 
some type of a criminal or alleged terrorist event? What 
compels that? What is the precedent? What has to happen?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt; So counterterrorism is not my expertise.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt; I understand.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt; However, I can tell you that NCTC is a
great partner of ours. We work with them each and every day on 
the counterterrorism front and share information on a regular 
basis, both on a Classified level and an Unclassified level.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;If you were working on a case, so to speak
though, and you determined that you need to bring the NCTC in, 
what makes that determination? Do they offer? Do you see 
things? How does that happen?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I am trying to figure out what that nexus is, and I have 
got a specific example in mind and I won't keep you in 
suspense.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;The mass hooting in Las Vegas, ISIS in June and August, per 
my recollection, warned the United States or warned us, warned 
the public that they were going to attack Las Vegas. Then I 
think up to four times post the incident claimed 
responsibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;    Yet at this point I don't think there is any NCTC 
involvement, but there is FBI involvement. So I am trying to 
figure out what is happening there? Do you know?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt; So I couldn't speak to the Las Vegas
shooting incident in this particular environment because of 
classification issues.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt; Well, what is the normal protocol though? What
would invoke? What would precipitate involving the NCTC?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt; Specifically I would have to get back to
you. I am happy to do that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt; There is no normal protocol that somebody has to
request it? You hear some traffic. You see some traffic. None 
of that? There is not a specific protocol that you know of at 
this time?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt; So my information is dated but I will tell
you based upon my personal experience working counterterrorism 
matters the dialog with NCTC happens every day in group 
meetings and then individually with folks that work from each 
agency. So I can tell you that that dialog is on-going. It is 
seamless.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt; OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt; But specifically if you are asking me for
protocols I will have to get back to you on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt; Yes, if you could, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt; Sure.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I would like to be able to understand that a
little bit better. Moving on with the remaining time I want to 
explore an area where this, again, is maybe out of the 
particular realm of this conversation, but Congress is meant to 
provide oversight in our role, and we provide a check on the 
Executive branch to ensure the balance of power between the two 
branches.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I have oftentimes, and you might not have and probably have 
nothing to do with this, but been frustrated by asking for 
briefings on particular issues from the FBI only to be told 
there is no briefing available. We are not going to brief you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;I understand the sensitivity of the case and that we don't 
want to jeopardize any on-going investigation. I will tell you 
one in particular that I have requested and recently requested 
again, and I am trying to work through whatever the protocols 
are.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Imran Awan is a case that I am interested in. We don't seem 
to have much information. I am just trying to verify and 
validate some things. This is an incident where literally the 
Congress is involved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;As I understand it the FBI's involved, yet we can get no 
information--zero. We can't get a briefing. We don't see any 
reports from the FBI so we don't know where the investigation 
stands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;Is it solely bank fraud? Is there something more to do with 
the links to Pakistan and the shadow, if you want to call it 
that, or whatever you want to call the car sales exercise and 
money laundering and so on and so forth? These seem to be 
reasonable questions for Members of Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;    Certainly I have got a bona-fide Top Secret clearance and 
plus whatever you characterize the one here in Congress. What 
must Members of Congress do to get a reasonable briefing on 
events that are appropriate? Is there something I am missing?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;No, sir. We make every effort to provide
those briefings at the request of Congress and others. I would 
encourage you to continue to make that request. We will send it 
up through our channels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;I will tell you that we are hesitant to comment both 
publicly or privately on on-going investigations. As a matter 
of fact, we are prohibited to do that. However, in certain 
instances we are able to provide those briefings when the 
request comes in.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;    So I am very familiar with----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perry&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;If you would please make a note that I have made
the request but maybe it will have a little more weight if you 
send it forward. But we will continue to, and I look forward to 
a continuing conversation on this and other issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Perry"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Perry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;    The gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Keating.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; Former prosecutor himself.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;That is right. That is correct. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, and thank all of you for your service to the country. 
It is really appreciated, and it is great to see the 
interagency cooperation on display here this morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;    I had a question, I guess Mr. Glenn first. You were 
describing some of the conditions in El Salvador and you were 
talking about how many homicides, gang activity, the violence 
that is there. It is a pretty violent place, isn't it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt; Young people that are there, is there coercive
activities with these gangs and other groups to coerce them 
into criminal activities?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt; What would you say, and is it important to
have cooperation, as you mentioned, with the local people in 
the country, not just the leaders themselves? That is part of 
what we are trying to instill. That is part of the three things 
you mentioned, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;So what are we to make of sending 200,000
people back to El Salvador in huge numbers? What is that going 
to--what message does that send to the people we are trying to 
create this cooperation with in El Salvador when they see 
family members who have fled because of danger, fear, being 
sent back?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;    Is that something that instills or will enhance cooperation 
locally in our activities? What kind of message could that 
send?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Sure. Well, I think it is important at least in
terms of why we do what we do in Central America, specifically 
in El Salvador. The reason that we offer the assistance that we 
do is because of the conditions in these countries.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt; Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; So we have----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt; So I mean is it fair to say that sending these
people that fled from those type of coercive activities and 
dangers we could be sending them right back into those 
dangerous situations----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Well, from an INL perspective, our
responsibility is to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt; No, no, I am sorry. I am just asking you with
your knowledge not as an official answer, but----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    Mr. Keating [continuing]. You know, with the knowledge 
which obviously you have for that part of the world and what is 
happening, is that kind-of a possibility?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Yes, but there are tough conditions and that is
why we are there trying to help resolve, to help them get the 
security infrastructure that they need.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt; So nothing has changed suddenly from the point
where those people fled from that coercive activity and it is 
still a problem. I am wouldn't say there's not improvement, but 
it's still a problem.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Oh, yes. I think we have seen some real
improvement, especially in some of the most dangerous 
neighborhoods, the neighborhood of Chamelecon in Honduras, for 
example, outside of San Pedro Sula. You know, in partnership 
with USAID and DOD, INL's place-based strategy has made 
significant improvements in a neighborhood like that that was a 
primary----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt; So but it is still dangerous?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Dangerous and getting better.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt; The country is--yes, great.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;All right. Thank you. I know those are
difficult questions to put you on the line for, but it is 
important to say as part of your earlier testimony indicated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;You know, there are about 100 people, almost 100 people a 
day in the United States dying, and when you look at the gang 
activity and the other activities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;But when we are looking at transnational criminal 
organizations, the one that is killing the most people in our 
country, as I said, almost 100 a day, are those activities that 
surround opioids and Fentanyl coming into our country, being 
counterfeited to look like Percocet or other commercial drugs, 
coming in with great potency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;It has spiked the deaths in my area and most of the country 
enormously. A lot of that is coming from China. Can you comment 
on what we are trying to do where right under the nose of the 
Chinese government the manufacturing of these that are 
occurring and being shipped through?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;    Because clearly that is costing the most American lives 
every day. Anything we are doing to focus on that specifically? 
Any of you, sorry; FBI, too.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;I can just mention briefly some of the things
that INL has been doing. One of the important things on 
Fentanyl and the analogs of Fentanyl, so there are multiple 
types of synthetic opioids that are being produced in China and 
brought into the United States, is to get those substances on 
the list of prohibited substances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;That has been successful. We will be going into the 
meetings in April in Vienna to get additional substances put on 
those lists.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    Engagement with China has been effective, and I think we 
have begun to see China taking a proactive----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;Quickly because my time is running out, it is
important to note that my discussions in private meetings with 
the Customs and Border Patrol, Homeland people, the greatest 
trend now is getting the shipments through UPS, FedEx, the 
United States Postal Service.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;These things are coming and you also have that in 
coordination with use of the internet and maybe some of the 
dark parts of the internet, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;I mean, is that creates a great challenge, a lot of those 
things. How are you doing on that? That is a pretty tough 
challenge to do, but are we getting more cooperation from the 
postal service or from these other countries at the point that 
they are being sent from?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;    FBI, you know, Mr. Richardson.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;Yes, sir, thank you for the question and
certainly realize that opioid addiction and trafficking of 
opioids in this country is a great problem. It will probably be 
worse tomorrow than it is today unfortunately, but we do have 
resources that are targeting the distributors of those illegal 
opioids to the communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;One thing that we are doing that is a little bit unique 
maybe from some of the other agencies is we have stood up a 
unit that looks at the dark net specifically in order to try to 
identify those individuals, those organizations that are on the 
dark net, the net beyond the net, hiding with autonomy that are 
sending the drugs through whether it is FedEx or whether it is 
the postal service or how the narcotics are coming in.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;    So we have had some success with that initiative thus far. 
We are going to add additional resources to that going forward, 
and we have been relatively successful, so----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;Well, thank you. My time is up. I would just
comment. I would rather give you and your collective activities 
on that arena more resources, more money, because it is killing 
more people than having an extended wall would result in saving 
people's lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;The gentleman yields.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;We are going to closed session soon, but I have two 
questions I would like to ask if you can answer them on the 
record. If not, we can wait 'til downstairs. I will ask them 
together and then you can respond.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;My staff recently visited El Salvador and they heard from 
agencies on the ground that the MS-13 leaders are actually 
frustrated that the MS-13 members in this country are not 
violent enough. They are going to be sending more violent 
members to the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;    Now, can you confirm that? If so can you say what, you 
know, the implications of that are? Would you be able to adapt 
to that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;So I will take a crack at it first. I can
tell you from the FBI perspective our intelligence streams tell 
us that what you have mentioned is accurate. Because of 
enforcement actions across the country, some of the leadership 
here at the mid-level within the United States of America they 
have been arrested. They are incarcerated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;    That is frustrating to the leadership of the MS-13 gang in 
El Salvador, and they are very much interested in sending 
younger, more violent offenders, gang members up through their 
channels into this country in order to be enforcers for the 
gang. So that is absolutely correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; Mr. Villanueva.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Villanueva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;Yes, sir. We can actually discuss some of
our on-going efforts later on today downstairs, but yes. We are 
looking at that problem. We are looking at the information we 
are getting and, once again, I mean, we are doubling down our 
efforts against MS-13.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt;    As a matter of fact, this year Operation Citadel, which we 
have been doing for a few years, it is just going to have an 
MS-13 component working with our international partners. We do 
have some other efforts that are going to be paramount to stop 
the flow of those individuals from coming in to the United 
States that we can discuss later today.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; Mr. Glenn, do you have any----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; Again, I would just reiterate that our efforts
are going to be in support of the units that they work with in 
the Northern Triangle region to help mitigate any kind of 
change in behaviors by the gangs.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;Yes. I would just say it is hard to imagine them
being much more violent, so truly a horrifying thought. I know 
within 1 mile of my house I am sure close to where Miss Rice 
lives they are actually digging up bodies of young kids who 
have been butchered by MS-13.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;    So one other question on that. Are there any signs of MS-13 
member partnering with traditional drug cartels?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt; I can--internationally?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. King"&gt; Internationally, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Glenn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;Yes. You know, they control neighborhoods just
like here in the United States. MS-13 and 18th Street gang 
members distribute drugs in their countries so they are an 
essential part of the distribution network of drugs in their 
countries for local consumption there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Glenn"&gt;    There are indications, although not in large ways, but 
there are indications that they do cooperate with the drug 
trafficking organizations that are sending drugs into the 
United States.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Richardson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;So I would say our intelligence tells us or
informs us that most of the relationships are opportunistic in 
nature. The MS-13 would be subordinate to the larger drug 
cartels that we are familiar with and we have worked for years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Richardson"&gt;    MS-13 is used as enforcers for particular shipments and/or 
distribution rings in some of the communities here within the 
United States. So that is the intelligence that we have 
currently regarding the partnership, but MS-13 is subordinate 
to the drug cartels.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Villanueva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Villanueva"&gt; Sir, along the same lines our information
is similar to the FBI. There is connectivity. It is just 
defining what connectivity looks like. So the same connectivity 
to be at par. Maybe not but maybe as a subordinate, the 
enforcers, distributors. There is certainly a connection to 
that effect.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. King&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. King"&gt;OK. I have no more questions in open session.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
