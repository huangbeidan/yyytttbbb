    &lt;option&gt;                     ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
    Mr. COSGROVE. Chairman Buchanan, ranking member----
    Chairman BUCHANAN. Turn on your mike.
    Mr. COSGROVE. Is it on now? Sorry.
    Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member Lewis, members of the 
subcommittee, I am pleased to be here today as you discuss 
Medicare program integrity issues.
    In 1990, GAO first designated Medicare as a high-risk 
program, in part due to the risk of improper payments. These 
are payments that were either made in error or for incorrect 
amounts. Sometimes they may be the result of fraud, and 
according to HHS' most recent estimate, Medicare improper 
payments totaled nearly $60 billion.
    My remarks today will focus on program integrity in 
Medicare part C, also known as Medicare Advantage, the private 
health plan alternative to the fee-for-service program.
    Chairman BUCHANAN. Could you speak up just a little bit, 
please.
    Mr. COSGROVE. Absolutely.
    Back in 1990, relatively few Medicare beneficiaries were 
enrolled in such plans. Since then, enrollment has grown 
substantially, and Medicare Advantage is a popular option. 
Today, one in three beneficiaries are enrolled, and payments to 
plan total about $200 billion. These magnitudes underscore the 
importance of addressing the 10 percent of plan payments that 
HHS estimates are improper.
    In Medicare Advantage, improper payments largely stem from 
beneficiary diagnoses that are unsupported by beneficiaries' 
medical records. That is because CMS uses these diagnoses to 
adjust plan payments up or down, a process known as risk 
adjustment, to pay plans more for sick beneficiaries and less 
for healthy ones. If the beneficiary diagnoses that plans 
report to CMS are wrong, then plans can be paid too little or 
too much.
    To identify and recover improper payments from plans, CMS 
conducts audits known as risk adjustment data validation, or 
RADV audits. In a RADV audit, a contractor checks the medical 
records for a sample of plan beneficiaries to see if the plan 
reported diagnoses are accurate and supported.
    The first RADV audits checked payments from 2007 for 32 
plan contracts. CMS' intention is to conduct about 30 annual 
audits that would identify any improper payments to a plan 
based on a sample of beneficiaries, then extrapolate the 
finding to estimate the total amount of improper payments made 
to that plan, and finally, recover the overpayments. CMS has 
now additional RADV audits underway for payment years 2011, 
2012, and 2013.
    We believe, based on our work, that fundamental changes are 
necessary to improve the RADV audits and recover additional 
substantial amounts of improper payments. First, RADV audits 
should be better focused on those plans with the highest 
potential for improper payments. Second, the RADV process must 
speed up for a variety of reasons, including a lengthy appeals 
process. None of the RADV audits has been completed. Third, 
recovery audit contractors, known as RACs, called for in the 
Affordable Care Act should be incorporated into the audit 
process. The RACs would work on a contingency basis and extend 
the resources available to conduct RADV audits.
    HHS agreed with our recommendations, and CMS has begun 
considering steps to address them, but the details of how the 
agency will address our recommendations have yet to be filled 
in.
    I also want to describe our concerns about the shortcomings 
in CMS' efforts to validate and use the encounter data that 
plans must now submit to the agency. For years, MA plans have 
been somewhat of black boxes. We knew how much the plans were 
paid and who they enrolled, but very little about the services 
that they actually provided. Before 2012, plans simply 
submitted the beneficiary diagnoses needed for risk adjustment. 
However, starting in 2012, CMS required plans to submit 
encounter data, which are similar to fee-for-service claims 
data, and contain information on all diagnoses and the medical 
services and items provided to the beneficiaries. In 2015, CMS 
began using diagnoses from these encounter data, along with 
other plan submitted data on diagnosis to risk adjust plan 
payments.
    In January of this year, we reported that CMS had made some 
progress in validating plans encounter data, but that certain 
important steps identified in our earlier report had not yet 
been fully addressed. For example, CMS had not fully 
established benchmarks for the completeness and accuracy of the 
data or it conducted analyses to compare submitted data with 
established benchmarks. We also found that CMS had not yet 
established specific plans for using the data for program 
integrity or other purposes that had been outlined, except for 
risk adjustment.
    We, therefore, continue to believe that CMS should 
implement our July 2014 recommendations by thoroughly assessing 
the data for completeness and accuracy and by establishing 
specific plans and timeframes for using these data for other 
purposes.
    This concludes my prepared remarks. I would be happy to 
answer any questions.
&lt;/option&gt;

    Mr. Morse, you are recognized.

    &lt;option&gt;                    PROGRAM INTEGRITY, CMMS
    Mr. MORSE. Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member Lewis, and 
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation and 
the opportunity to discuss the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid 
Services program integrity efforts in the Medicare program.
    We share this subcommittee's commitment to protecting 
beneficiaries, ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent 
appropriately, and identifying and correcting improper 
payments.
    As required by statute, each year, CMS estimates the 
improper payment rate and projected dollar amount of improper 
payments for the Medicare program. CMS takes seriously our 
responsibility to make sure our programs pay the right amount 
to the right party for the right beneficiary in accordance with 
the laws and regulations.
    It is important to remember that while all payments made as 
a result of fraud are considered to be improper payments, 
improper payments typically do not involve fraud. Rather, for 
CMS programs, improper payments most often occur when there is 
insufficient documentation to determine whether the service was 
medically necessary.
    CMS' approach to program integrity in the Medicare fee-for-
service and Medicare Advantage programs are determined by 
inherent differences in the programs themselves. I want to 
spend some time highlighting our program integrity work in 
Medicare fee-for-service and our approach to Medicare 
Advantage, and also the cross-cutting work we do with the help 
of our public and private partners, including our colleagues at 
the GAO and the Justice Department.
    To estimate the Medicare fee-for-service improper payment 
rate, CMS reviews a statistically valid random sample of 
Medicare fee-for-service claims. Most recently, the Medicare 
fee-for-service improper payment rate was 11 percent in 2016. 
Unlike Medicare fee-for-service in Medicare Advantage, CMS 
makes prospective monthly per capita payments to the MA 
organizations. As a result, CMS uses a different methodology to 
calculate the Medicare Part C improper payment rate. In 2016, 
the Medicare Part C improper payment rate was 9.9 percent.
    The Part C improper payment rate estimate is based on 
medical record review conducted by the CMS' annual risk 
adjustment data validation, or RADV, process, where the 
unsupported diagnoses are identified and corrected as risk 
scores are recalculated.
    In an effort to reduce the Medicare improper payment rates, 
CMS has instituted many program improvements, and is 
continuously looking for ways to refine and improve our program 
integrity activities. We are always working to more closely 
align payments with the cost of providing care, encouraging 
healthcare providers to deliver better care, and improving 
access to care for our beneficiaries.
    CMS estimates that, through our program integrity 
activities, Medicare prevented or recovered $17 billion in 
fiscal year 2015. For example, our fraud prevention system 
resulted in $604 million in fraudulent payments being stopped, 
prevented, or identified last year. CMS also recently updated 
the version of the FPS, which is now called FPS 2.0, which 
improves our model development time and expands CMS predictive 
analytics capabilities.
    CMS also saved Medicare approximately $400 million in 2016, 
using the National Correct Coding Initiative, or NCCI edits, 
which promote correct coding methodologies and control improper 
payments in Medicare Part A, Part B, and for durable medical 
equipment.
    CMS also conducts various medical review activities to help 
prevent improper payments. For example, CMS uses Medicare 
Administrative Contractors, or MACs, to review claims submitted 
by providers and suppliers on a prepayment basis. In fiscal 
year 2015, MAC prepayment medical review resulted in nearly $5 
billion in improper payments being prevented. Overall, these 
efforts help us to avoid pay and chase, as well as promote 
provider compliance.
    CMS and the Justice Department have also developed a 
partnership with private health plans and State Medicaid 
programs to fight healthcare fraud, known as the Healthcare 
Fraud Prevention Partnership. The partnership provides 
visibility into the larger universe of healthcare claims beyond 
those encountered by any single payer. The goal of the 
partnership is to exchange data and identify trends and 
patterns that will uncover fraud, waste, and abuse.
    CMS now has 79 public-private and State organizations as 
part of the partnership. And just last week, HHS, along with 
the Justice Department, announced the largest ever healthcare 
fraud enforcement action by the Medicare Fraud Strike Force. 
The takedown involved 412 charged defendants across 41 Federal 
districts for their alleged participation in healthcare fraud 
schemes involving approximately $1.3 billion in false billings. 
Over 120 defendants, including doctors, nurses, and 
pharmacists, were charged for their roles in prescribing and 
distributing opioids and other dangerous narcotics. In 
addition, HHS suspended the Medicare payments of 295 providers.
    CMS also takes seriously our commitment to combatting the 
opioid epidemic, and works to address abusive prescribing 
through data monitoring, information sharing with Medicare Part 
D, and law enforcement.
    CMS appreciates the work of the GAO on their 
recommendations of ways to improve Medicare program integrity. 
We look forward to continuing to work with them to improve and 
protect the Medicare Trust Fund, while providing beneficiaries 
with high quality care. I look forward to answering the 
subcommittee's questions on how we can improve our commitment 
to protecting taxpayer funded dollars, while also protecting 
beneficiaries' access to care.
