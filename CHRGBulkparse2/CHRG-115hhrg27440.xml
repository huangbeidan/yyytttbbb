                              ----------                              
                      Wednesday, October 25, 2017
                     U.S. House of Representatives
                     Committee on Natural Resources
                             Washington, DC
                              ----------                              
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in 
room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Rob Bishop 
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Bishop, Lamborn, Wittman, 
McClintock, Pearce, Thompson, Labrador, Tipton, LaMalfa, Cook, 
Hice, Radewagen, Cheney, Gianforte; Grijalva, Tsongas, Torres, 
and Soto.
    Also present: Representative Amodei.
    The Chairman. Thank you. We welcome you to the Committee 
hearing today. I will call this meeting to order when it is 
time. But according to our clock up there we still have a half-
hour before it starts, so if any of you want to just flit 
around for a while, you got it.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. This Committee is called to order. The 
Committee is meeting today to hear testimony on empowering 
state based management solutions for the greater sage-grouse 
recovery.
    I ask unanimous consent at this time that the gentleman 
from Nevada, Mr. Amodei, be allowed to sit with the Committee 
and participate in the hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    However, that is conditioned upon the fact that I never see 
him carrying his laundry to his apartment again in the morning. 
If you want to look like a peasant woman carrying your clothes, 
that is fine, but not in public. OK, we are set.
    Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements are 
limited to the Chairman, the Ranking Minority Member, and the 
Vice Chair. This will allow us to hear from witnesses faster. I 
ask unanimous consent that all other Members' opening 
statements be made part of the hearing record if they are 
submitted to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5:00 p.m. today.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Let me start with my opening statement.
&lt;/option&gt;

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF THE HON. ROB BISHOP, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF UTAH&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP"&gt;    The Chairman. Today, the Committee members are meeting to &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP"&gt;examine state-driven successes that we have seen in the 
management of the greater sage-grouse. Clearly, there is a 
continuing need for local control over both the bird and its 
habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP"&gt;The range of the greater sage-grouse covers millions of 
acres over parts of 11 states. It is as expansive as it is 
varied, and yet there are different ways in which we handle 
that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP"&gt;Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was an 
administration that decided to tell the states we have a 
problem with the sage-grouse, you come up with a plan to solve 
that problem and we will implement that. Then I watched as 
states busily became involved in coming up with a plan that met 
the environmental needs of their particular communities. Only 
then to find, later on, that the administration that said we 
will honor the state plans decided to change their mind. They 
instead came up with a one-size-fits-all approach, based on 
whatever science, we don't know, because it was never actually 
shown to us. Nor were those who came up with that science ever 
allowed to talk to this particular Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP"&gt;So, instead, we have a hybrid system that is not 
necessarily helping the problem today. That is the purpose of 
today's hearing: to provide further evidence that state and 
local control leads to lasting success, not just to actually 
control and manage the bird, but to rehabilitate the species. 
And that is the goal of the state-side programs, which is not 
necessarily the product of a one-size-fits-all Federal approach 
to this particular issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP"&gt;States have consistently proven they are masters at caring 
for their own lands and their wildlife, and sage-grouse is no 
different. In my home state of Utah, for example, the state 
spends an average of $5 million a year managing sage-grouse. 
With its state plan, Utah can cut fire lines, remove flammable 
invasive species, and react quickly in the event of wildfire. 
The plan has produced excellent results, with significantly 
fewer wildfire damages to sage-grouse habitat in 2016, and 
minimizing the impact of this and future fire seasons.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP"&gt;The reason I mention that is, quite frankly, the greatest 
threat we have to sage-grouse in my state is wildfire. If we 
can actually control and manage the wildfire, we actually help 
the habitat of that bird. And if you can get the crows to quit 
eating their eggs, that would be helpful, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP"&gt;I look forward to hearing from local stakeholders, 
representing several sage-grouse states that not only have 
state plans working, but the bird is thriving under their local 
management.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP"&gt;It is important that we applaud the current 
Administration's efforts to correct the flaws in these resource 
management plans of the past. However, it is also important 
that the Administration fully recognize the successes of state 
plans, the opportunity we have with state plans, and to ensure 
a robust local input as they develop these kinds of 
corrections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Bishop follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;I thank our witnesses for traveling great distances to be 
here today and to outline what their states have and can do in 
the future. We have found that implementing their locally 
developed recovery plans will be the best source that we can 
do, not just, as I said, to control sage-grouse, but to 
rehabilitate this species and move forward in the future.
   Prepared Statement of the Hon. Rob Bishop, Chairman, Committee on&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;Natural Resources&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;Today, the Committee meets to examine state-driven successes we 
have seen in the management of the greater sage-grouse. Clearly, there 
is a continuing need for local control over both the bird and its 
habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;The range of the greater sage-grouse, covering millions of acres 
over parts of 11 states, is as expansive as it is varied. Yet, the 
Federal Government under the Obama administration insisted on managing 
greater sage-grouse recovery with a Washington, DC, one-size-fits-all 
approach that fails miserably to address the individual management 
challenges present in each state.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;The purpose of today's hearing is to provide further evidence that 
state and local control leads to lasting success. States have 
consistently proven to be masters at caring for their own lands and 
wildlife, and sage-grouse is no different.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;In my home state of Utah, for instance, the state spends an average 
of $5 million a year managing sage-grouse. The results are encouraging: 
our state has seen the population of the bird increase steadily since 
1990, and Utah is well exceeding the target number of male sage-grouse 
established by our recovery plan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;This success is due to the state's ability to tailor the management 
plan to meet the distinct needs of Utah's environment. Unlike other 
states, the single greatest problem threatening sage-grouse in Utah is 
catastrophic wildfires. With its state plan, Utah can cut fire lines, 
remove flammable invasive species, and react quickly in the event of a 
wildfire. The plan has produced excellent results, with significantly 
fewer wildfires damaging sage-grouse habitat in 2016, and minimizing 
the impact of this and future fire seasons.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;All of this, despite the prior administration's regulatory attempt 
to force a Federal `one-size-fits-all' approach. Simply put, had Utah 
been mandated to implement a Nevada plan, or a California plan, or 
anything less than a tailored solution, much more of Utah would have 
quite literally gone up in smoke and our grouse population would have 
suffered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;Irrespective of what success Utah or other states can achieve on 
their own, however, the Fish and Wildlife Service has dictated its 
intent to re-examine the species for listing by 2020.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;I look forward to hearing from local stakeholders representing 
several sage-grouse states that, not only are the state plans working, 
but the bird is thriving under local management.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;Imposing an ESA listing decision of the sage-grouse would stifle 
state-based management plans, unravel the nearly 15 years of positive 
advances made by western states, and disregard the investment each 
state has made to protect the species. In addition, the BLM and Forest 
Service are currently reviewing the 98 resource management plans that 
were developed simultaneously with the Fish and Wildlife Service's 
decision to not list sage-grouse. These federally decreed plans, which 
left in place would create a `de facto' listing, are overly 
restrictive, rushed decisions that did failed to consider local input 
in many areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;We applaud the current Administration's efforts to correct the 
flaws in these resource management plans. However, it is important also 
that the Administration fully recognize the successes of the state 
plans, and ensure robust local input as they develop their corrections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bishop "&gt;I thank our witnesses for traveling out to be here today to outline 
the successes each of their states have found in implementing their 
locally developed recovery plans, underscoring the all that is possible 
through smart and effective local control.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF THE HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THE HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA"&gt;                                 ______
Ranking Member for his statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grijalva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me also join
with you in welcoming our witnesses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;In 2015, the last time we held an oversight hearing on the 
sage-grouse management, the Majority and their witnesses 
complained about being cut out of the process. Of course, these 
claims were false and have been abandoned. People know that the 
corresponding effort to conserve sage-grouse and sagebrush 
habitat without an ESA listing was highly inclusive and 
transparent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Now, the Majority has shifted from criticizing the process 
to criticizing the outcome. They claim that sage-grouse 
conservation plans put in place last year are not based on 
sound science, are hindering economic development, and are 
increasing wildfires and encroachment by invasive species. 
These claims are also false.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Let's talk about the real facts that are grounded in 
science, and put aside the ``alternative facts'' grounded in 
nothing more than the hope that nobody is really paying 
attention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;It is a fact that restoring sagebrush ecosystems is more 
complicated than allowing more cattle grazing. Scientific 
studies show not only that cattle grazing played a big role in 
spreading cheatgrass, but also that higher grazing intensity 
promotes the continued spread of that plant. The same is true 
for pinyon-juniper encroachment, which scientists have found to 
be significantly greater in grazed areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;The science also shows that grazing will not stop fires 
under very hot and dry conditions, just as those being 
experienced more and more in our West as a result of climate 
change. But climate change is a factor that is not being 
considered by this Administration and Congress. In fact, it is 
being debased and denied as a science and a reality in that 
climate change is and must be factored in the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Making our lands more resilient to these threats is a 
complex challenge, and the solution is painstaking, science-
based range restoration, not turning cattle loose and calling 
it a day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;The science also shows that habitat fragmentation from 
energy development and mining are key threats to sage-grouse. 
The Obama administration worked with states, localities, 
tribes, industry, scientists, and other stakeholders to protect 
core sage-grouse habitats without impacting existing mining and 
energy claims and still maintaining access to the vast majority 
of these recoverable resources.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;That is not a job killer; that is the definition of 
multiple use and sustainable, responsible management of our 
natural resources.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Cries that the Federal Government imposed cookie-cutter or 
one-size-fits-all policies are also disingenuous. States have 
full control over how they manage for sage-grouse conservation 
on state and private lands, and all 98 of the resource 
management plans underpinning the conservation strategy are 
individually tailored.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Of course, the Majority does not really care about any of 
these facts. All they care about is their crusade to transfer 
U.S. public lands, or management of these lands, from Federal 
agencies representing all Americans to states and localities 
that represent a few.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Two of our invited guests, witnesses today, have publicly 
argued for this approach, never mind the fact that the states 
lack the resources to manage these lands effectively without 
selling them off to the highest bidder.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;So, instead of celebrating the sage-grouse conservation 
success, the Majority is focused on keeping two myths alive to 
support their seize-and-sell agenda.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;The first myth is that the Endangered Species Act does not 
work. That has been disproven time and time again, but never 
more clearly than in the particular case that we are dealing 
with today, where state and Federal partners worked hand in 
hand to prevent the listings of a species.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;The second is the myth that the West is a land of 
inexhaustible natural resources that could produce infinite 
wealth and job opportunities, if only the Federal Government 
would get out of the way. Much of the West is evolving. Its 
economic future is in clean energy, outdoor industries, and 
lower-impact, more sustainable resource use.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

wonderful one-liners, I am going through my head and I am not 
going to use any of them right now. We will go directly to the 
witnesses that are there. I appreciate them being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="The Chairman. I am now going to introduce our witnesses"&gt;We will hear from you in this order: the Honorable Scott

from Oakley, Idaho, thank you for being here; Mr. Darin Bird, 
who is the Deputy Director of the Utah Department of Natural 
Resources from Salt Lake City, Utah; the Honorable John Tubbs, 
who is the Director of the Montana Department of Natural 
Resources and Conservation in Helena, Montana; the Honorable 
J.J.--oh, I was going to say that correctly and I screwed it up 
already, Goicoechea--the County Commissioner and the Chairman 
of the Eureka County Commissioners in Eureka County, Nevada.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Actually, this is the first time we have used this committee 
room since it was fixed. Hopefully it works. But at least, on 
the plus side, you don't have to look at the old chairmen of 
the Budget Committee any more. So, at least that is a plus for 
us. Since they are not automatic, you are going to have to 
press the button to be on there, and just adjust how close you 
need to be to be heard from that point on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

green light is on, you are using your 5 minutes and everything 
is going great. When the yellow light comes on, it is like a 
traffic light and you have to hustle through as fast as you 
possibly can, because when the red light goes on I am going to 
cut you off, even though that is rude. But I apologize, we are 
going to have to do that. I will do the same with Members, too. 
So, when it is your turn, remember, if it is yellow, go faster, 
because I am going to cut you off at 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF THE HON. SCOTT BEDKE, SPEAKER OF THE IDAHO HOUSE&lt;/opening&gt;

you for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="THE HON. SCOTT BEDKE"&gt;               OF REPRESENTATIVES, OAKLEY, IDAHO
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and
members of the Committee. Thank you for this invitation to 
testify on the importance of sage-grouse conservation in the 
West. I am the Speaker of the House in Idaho and a charter 
member of the governor's task force on sage-grouse, and I 
perhaps am uniquely qualified to testify on this topic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;For five generations my family has had a ranching operation 
in the heart of greater sage-grouse habitat in the Great Basin 
of Southern Idaho and Northern Nevada. Our ranch operates in a 
way that benefits the greater sage-grouse and its habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;The best available science has shown us that the major 
threats to sage-grouse populations in the Great Basin are, 
Number one, wildfire; and Number two, the invasive plants that 
follow a large fire. The best science also says that livestock 
grazing is a second-tier threat, and then only when it is 
employed improperly. Proper livestock grazing is not deemed to 
be a threat at all.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;The Idaho sage-grouse plan is predicated on decades of 
science and expertise. Instead of adopting Idaho's sage-grouse 
plan, the 2015 Federal land use plan amendments seek to punish 
livestock grazing with unreasonably large lek buffers and 
impossible minimum stubble height requirements. If, as the 
science says, wildfire is the Number one threat to sage-grouse 
populations, then further reductions on livestock grazing 
create and increase fuel load, making the habitat much more 
susceptible to larger and more frequent wildfires. The 
amendments are counterproductive to the sage-grouse 
conservation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;This past summer, my family witnessed firsthand how good 
intentions and a total lack of practical knowledge can 
backfire. Lightning started a small fire on one of our grazing 
allotments on the Nevada-Idaho border. The first burned 
approximately 500 acres before it was declared out and 
contained. The next day the fire started up, however, and the 
firefighters returned with their equipment. To our surprise, 
some of the heavy equipment sat around unused for hours, while 
the fire continued to grow and eventually burned another 20,000 
acres, all of which was in prime sage-grouse habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Why? Because Federal regulations prevented the use of 
firefighting equipment since there was not a qualified Cat 
tender on the fire. A Cat tender is a person that walks in 
front of the bulldozer as the fire line is created, in order to 
assure that no historical artifacts are disturbed. However, 
most of the time the fire line is laid down in an area that has 
already been disturbed, such as an existing road or fence line, 
as it was in this case, thus obviating the need for 
archeological clearance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;So, thousands of acres of prime sage-grouse habitat burned 
because of improper Federal firefighter policy. This scenario 
will be repeated if fuel control activities such as grazing are 
further restricted. There is nothing wrong with using a Cat 
tender, but Federal red tape resulted in a perverse outcome, 
since those on the ground did not have the decision-making 
authority to quickly assess and adapt to a rapidly escalating 
range fire. In other words, they were not allowed to employ 
common sense, and thousands of acres of habitat burned, 
arguably, needlessly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Range fire is the top concern in Idaho sage-grouse habitat. 
Our plans are specifically designed to address the factors 
which result in catastrophic wildfire, but there seems to be a 
growing trend in the Federal resource planning ignoring decades 
of experience and the specific needs of the western states. In 
fact, Federal sage-grouse plans will actually make the 
situation worse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Let me explain how that has happened. Anti-grazing 
activists have been fighting lawsuits for decades, trying to 
list grazing as one of the threats to the greater sage-grouse. 
The activists hold to a completely unproven theory that minimum 
stubble height will help grouse hide from ravens and crows, who 
predate on sage-grouse nests. But because ravens and crows have 
been unmanaged for decades due to Federal restrictions on 
predator control, their numbers now far exceed historical 
levels. As a result, in many places sage-grouse nest predation 
by crows and ravens is somewhere in the range of 60 to 90 
percent mortality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Rather than implement predator control to reduce nest 
predation, the BLM and the Forest Service have adopted unproven 
stubble height requirements that will result in fewer AUMs and 
increased fuel loads. Federal agencies have made the Number one 
threat to sage-grouse in Idaho worse. In fact, these Federal 
amendments, if left standing, will create an explosive wildfire 
situation throughout the Great Basin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Bedke follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;In summary, Mr. Chairman, since 2014, I have been meeting 
with you and your staff regarding the coming disaster of these 
sage-grouse plan amendments. The very things that we warned 
against are now adopted by the BLM and Forest Service. More 
Federal regulation is only making the situation on the ground 
worse for the greater sage-grouse.
 Prepared Statement of Rep. Scott Bedke, Speaker of the Idaho House of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Representatives&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for the 
invitation to testify regarding the importance of protecting state 
sage-grouse conservation in the West. We appreciate your efforts to 
provide congressional protections for Idaho's sage-grouse plans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;I am the Speaker of the House in the state of Idaho and a charter 
member of the Governor of Idaho's sage-grouse task force. I am also 
perhaps uniquely positioned to testify regarding the greater sage-
grouse. My brother and I run a family ranching operation. For five 
generations, our family has operated in the heart of greater sage-
grouse habitat in the Great Basin of southern Idaho and northern 
Nevada. We understand the needs of greater sage-grouse. Our ranching 
operation is designed to operate according to the best available 
science and methodology to benefit the greater sage-grouse and its 
habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Idaho's sage-grouse conservation efforts are designed to address 
the conservation of sage-grouse in the state of Idaho using the best 
available science. That science determined that the largest threat to 
the sage-grouse population in the Great Basin is, Number one, wildfire, 
and Number two, the invasive plant species that proliferate after a 
large fire. The best science also says that livestock grazing is a 
``second tier'' threat--and then only if the grazing is carried out 
improperly. Proper livestock grazing is not deemed to be a threat at 
all.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;All of the sage-grouse stakeholders were disappointed in the 
Federal land management agencies' disregard for the decades of science 
and expertise upon which Idaho's sage-grouse plans are predicated. 
Instead of adopting Idaho's sage-grouse plan, the 2015 Federal land use 
plan amendments seek to punish livestock grazing with unreasonably 
large lek (breeding ground) buffers and impossible minimum stubble 
height requirements. If, as the science says, wildfire is the Number 
one threat to the sage-grouse population, then Federal plan amendments 
that further restrict livestock grazing create an increased fuel load, 
thus making the habitat much more susceptible to larger and more 
frequent wildfires. The amendments are counterproductive to sage-grouse 
conservation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;This past summer, my family witnessed firsthand how good intentions 
and a total lack of practical knowledge can backfire. Lightning started 
a range fire on one of our grazing allotments on the Nevada-Idaho 
border. The fire burned approximately 500 acres and was declared out 
and contained, and the fire crews left. The next day, the fire started 
again and burned approximately another 20,000 acres, all of which was 
in sage-grouse habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;As the fire began to build again, the hardworking firefighters 
showed up with their firefighting equipment. To our surprise, most of 
the heavy equipment sat unused for hours. The fire continued to grow 
and get more out of control. Why? Because Federal regulations prevented 
the use of firefighting equipment since a ``Cat tender'' had not shown 
up. A ``Cat tender'' is a person who walks in front a bulldozer as the 
fire line is created, in order to assure that no historical artifacts 
are disturbed. However, most of the time the fire line is laid down in 
areas that have already been disturbed, such as an existing road or 
fence line, as it was in this case--thus obviating the need for 
archaeological clearance or cat tending. So instead of extinguishing 
the fire, thousands of acres of prime sage-grouse habitat burned. In 
fact, essentially the entire winter unit of our allotment was consumed 
in one large catastrophic wildfire.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;These dangerous situations will be made worse by restrictions on 
fuel control activities such as grazing. There is nothing wrong with 
using a ``Cat tender.'' But Federal red tape resulted in a perverse 
outcome. Rather than being able to quickly assess the situation on the 
ground and doing the right thing, those on the ground did not have the 
decision-making authority to adapt to a quickly escalating wildfire.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;What we are talking about here is using common sense.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;There seems to be a growing trend in Federal resource planning of 
ignoring the needs of the western states, to say nothing of the decades 
of wisdom and practical experience we can offer. Let me speak more 
specifically: catastrophic wildfire is the top concern in Idaho sage-
grouse habitats. Our plans are designed to address the factors which 
can result in catastrophic wildfire. Federal sage-grouse plans not only 
ignore Idaho's science and our decades of experience in addressing 
these contributing factors, but they will actually make the situation 
worse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Let me explain how this happened. Anti-grazing activists have been 
filing lawsuits for decades to list livestock grazing as one of the 
threats to the greater sage-grouse. Their theory has been to reduce 
AUMs by requiring a minimum stubble height on the range. Their 
justification is a completely unproven theory that a minimum stubble 
height requirement will help grouse hide from ravens and crows who 
predate on sage-grouse nests. Because ravens and crows have been 
literally unmanaged for decades due to Federal restrictions on predator 
control, their numbers far exceed historic levels. As a result, in many 
places, nest predation by ravens and crows is somewhere in the range of 
60-90 percent of the sage-grouse nests. So rather than implement 
predator control to reduce nest predation, the BLM and Forest Service 
adopted unproven stubble height restrictions that will result in fewer 
AUMs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;In addition, there are common-sense changes that can be employed in 
firefighting protocols. In the process of placating anti-grazing 
activists, Federal agencies have made the Number one threat to the 
greater sage-grouse in Idaho worse. In fact, these Federal amendments, 
if left to stand, will create an explosive wildfire situation 
throughout the Great Basin. This shows a lack of common sense and 
ignores the threat assessment and the best available science upon which 
the states' sage-grouse plans are based.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, since 2014 we have been 
meeting with you and your staff regarding the coming disaster of these 
Federal sage-grouse plan amendments. The very things which we warned 
against were adopted by the BLM and Forest Service. This summer, our 
family witnessed the catastrophic wildfire which we had predicted could 
occur. More Federal regulation is not helping sage-grouse and their 
habitats; in fact, it is hurting. Placating anti-grazing, anti-
sportsmen, and radical anti-use activists is making the situation on 
the ground worse for the greater sage-grouse. Good intentions are not 
good enough for the people of the West. These plans are bad for the 
West, bad for jobs, and bad for sage-grouse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;We are encouraged by Chairman Bishop's sage-grouse legislation. 
Western states have invested $750 million to address the needs of sage-
grouse. These state conservation measures need to be respected and 
protected. The previous administration's 2015 BLM and Forest Service 
sage-grouse plans are misguided at best, catastrophic at worst. These 
plans are based on restrictions on human activity rather than 
addressing the real threats of pinyon/juniper encroachment, wildfire, 
and post-wildfire effects, which account for the greatest challenges to 
sage-grouse habitat in the state of Idaho and across the Great Basin. 
Instead, these plans seem to be based on the Wyoming and Colorado sage-
grouse plans which do not, and will not, work for Idaho.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;This past winter, Governor Butch Otter and I visited congressional 
leaders and expressed Idaho's strong support for reversing these 
Federal sage-grouse plan amendments and providing congressional 
protections for Idaho's conservation measures. For the last 20 years, 
sage-grouse populations have been steady or increasing in Idaho and 
across the West. We are committed to sage-grouse conservation in the 
state of Idaho. For 30 years, radical environmental activists have been 
petitioning to list this bird and have been filing lawsuit after 
lawsuit. Greater sage-grouse are not endangered. State conservation 
plans are working to protect and conserve sage-grouse and their 
habitat. It is time to take congressional action to protect the state 
plans. Please give the state-based plans a chance and some time to 
work. We in Idaho are committed to their success.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;______
Questions Submitted for the Record by Rep. Hice to the Honorable Scott&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Bedke, Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives
The Honorable Scott Bedke did not submit responses to the Committee by 
the appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Question 1. Speaker Bedke, in your testimony, you indicate that 
sportsmen and women are not being utilized adequately in the fight to 
conserve sage-grouse. This was disappointing to hear as most sportsmen 
and women that I know agree that conservation of public lands and 
species is important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Can you expand on that statement and explain why sportsmen and 
women are integral to conservation and why you feel this is not 
happening in your state?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;Question 2. How should sportsmen and women serve as partners in 
sage-grouse conservation? What options are available to the average 
sportsman to engage in conservation efforts?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Bedke "&gt;                                 ______
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. All right, thank you&lt;/speaker&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF DARIN BIRD, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, UTAH DEPARTMENT OF&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DARIN BIRD"&gt;Mr. Bird, you are recognized for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="DARIN BIRD"&gt;            NATURAL RESOURCES, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;Thank you. Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member
Grijalva, and members of the Committee, thank you for your kind 
invitation for me to appear today. I am appearing on behalf of 
Governor Gary Herbert, and ask that a copy of his written 
testimony be included as part of the hearing record, as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;It is easy to come and testify against unpopular Federal 
programs; however, that is not my purpose today. I am here to 
talk about one of the successes, and what is needed to protect 
sage-grouse, western habitats, and hardworking Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;Catastrophic wildfire has become a major concern across the 
American West. This year the Federal Government has spent $2 
billion on wildfire control. This is a new record, and 
tremendously burdensome for the American taxpayer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;When it comes to sage-grouse, our Number one concern in the 
state of Utah is wildfire. In 2007, Utah experienced a severe 
wildfire season. One catastrophic wildfire burned over 300,000 
acres in central Utah. As a state, we assessed the problem and 
took action. We raised millions of dollars in private and state 
funding. Along with our Federal partners, we began to address 
the root causes of catastrophic fire in sage-grouse habitats, 
and began to restore Utah watersheds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;This program, Utah Watershed Restoration Initiative, has 
completed hundreds of projects in the last 10 years. Over 500 
private, state, and Federal partners have contributed to this 
program financially. We have invested over $150 million and 
treated approximately 1.3 million acres. In just 9 years, we 
have cut the number of wildfire and sage-grouse habitat by 50 
percent. We have had almost no catastrophic wildfires in our 
sage-grouse habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;In fact, the total acres burned since these efforts began 
has been one-fifth of what it was before we started these 
conservation actions. This has saved 514,552 acres of sage-
grouse habitat in these last 9 years. It has also saved tens of 
millions of dollars of wildfire-fighting costs in the state of 
Utah. These projects do more than just control fire; they 
restore our watersheds, native vegetative communities, and 
dramatically enhance habitat for wildlife. These areas are 
wetter, produce more runoff, and they dramatically increase the 
resilience and redundancy of habitats for sage-grouse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;Our researchers are documenting dramatic, measurable 
improvements in habitat utilization, nesting success, and 
population response of sage-grouse in these restored areas. By 
every measure, this program has become a resounding success for 
sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;I am here to do more than just share a feel-good success 
story of a program that is working. I am here to protect these 
programs. In 2015, the Obama administration adopted land-use 
plan amendments aimed at imposing more regulations on human 
activities on millions of acres across the state of Utah. These 
Federal sage-grouse plans may be well intentioned, but they are 
a threat to the partnerships, funding, and collaboration that 
makes Utah's watershed restoration initiative work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;Here is the problem: the state of Utah relies on economic 
activity on areas outside of our sage-grouse management areas 
to help pay for Utah's Watershed Restoration Initiative. These 
new regulations have essentially brought much of the new 
economic activity in areas outside of Utah's sage-grouse 
management areas to a standstill. What this means is that 
funding for mitigation, sportsmen, and state tax revenues are 
being lost. This threatens the one program, the watershed 
initiative, that is doing the most to protect and restore sage-
grouse in the state of Utah.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;Good intentions do not make good policy. My earnest 
petition is that Congress let the people who are impacted the 
most enact the policies needed to protect our families and our 
communities. I am asking you to protect a program that is 
unrivaled in the Nation. The success of our Watershed 
Restoration Initiative in restoring and protecting sage-grouse 
is one of the reasons why Utah's legislature passed a nearly 
unanimous bipartisan resolution in support of a bill introduced 
by Congressman Bishop to protect Utah's sage-grouse 
conservation efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Bird follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Bird "&gt;Take action and pass legislation that will protect the 
proven, on-ground conservation programs that are working for 
sage-grouse, sage-grouse habitats, and hard-working Americans. 
Thank you very much, and I look forward to your questions.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="JOHN TUBBS"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="JOHN TUBBS"&gt;      NATURAL RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION, HELENA, MONTANA
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Grijalva, and members of the Committee. My name is John Tubbs, 
and I am the Director of the Department of Natural Resources 
and Conservation and the Chairman of the Montana Sage Grouse 
Oversight Team. Thank you for the opportunity to provide 
Montana's perspective on how Congress and the Administration 
can effectively empower state management for the greater sage-
grouse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;I have three main points today. First and foremost, the 
states have been and will continue to be empowered if Congress 
and the Administration recognize and support the long history 
of bipartisan state-led collaboration to conserve the greater 
sage-grouse across its range in the West.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;States have served as the primary convener of diverse 
stakeholders for decades, and have been the primary drivers of 
policy initiatives, targeting sage-grouse conservation through 
the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the 
Western Governors' Association Sage Grouse Task Force. Congress 
and the Administration should continue to give deference to 
state leadership and should avoid actions that undermine years 
of collaborative efforts among our partners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Montana finalized its most recent plan in 2015. It too is 
grounded in the work of diverse stakeholders, and continues 
with an all lands/all hands approach. Montana's plan aligns 
closely with Wyoming's plan, only with a greater emphasis on 
private lands, where most of Montana's best sage-grouse habitat 
occurs. It also has a broad bipartisan support of the Montana 
State Legislature.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Our stakeholders are directly engaged with our state 
program on a regular basis. They continue to express support 
for how the Federal plans and state plans work together in 
concert toward Montana's common shared goal of precluding the 
need to list the greater sage-grouse under the ESA, so that we 
maintain authority to manage our lands, our economy, and our 
wildlife.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Second, Congress and the Administration can empower states 
by avoiding policy changes that foster uncertainty and hold the 
potential to land sage-grouse on the Endangered Species Act 
list. The conclusion that the sage-grouse did not warrant 
listing in 2015 was predicated on the fact that Federal and 
state land use plans provide the certainty required to 
demonstrate that the threats would be reduced in approximately 
90 percent of the breeding habitat and a majority of the 
occupied range.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;These regulatory mechanisms did not exist in 2010, when it 
was determined that a listing was warranted. Congress and the 
Administration should avoid changes that undermine the 
foundation of the 2015 not-warranted finding, and must consider 
how future risks of listing may disproportionately impact 
states.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Montana is concerned that the potential changes to Federal 
plans may erode the very underpinnings that were critical to 
achieving the conservation rangewide of sage-grouse, and that 
it was sufficient to avoid listing in 2015. State plans alone 
are not sufficient. Montana believes potential legal issues 
could arise from taking a hasty and narrow view toward changing 
Federal plans. A thoughtful analysis is needed to identify 
elements of Federal plans that were necessary to conserve 
habitat and that were relied upon by the Service when it 
concluded that the listing was not warranted. Any changes that 
would undercut the efficacy of the conservation measures to 
address threats and measured against the best-available science 
should make us pause to reconsider.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Finally, states can be supported by efforts to adaptively 
implement land use plans to address changing conditions, use 
new science, build consistency across ownerships with state 
conservation strategies. The Administration should use all 
available tools, including the issuance of guidance, 
instruction memoranda, training, and other strategies to build 
consistencies. The Administration must exercise due diligence, 
and consult with states prior to embarking on the costly, time-
consuming plan amendments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;We spent 3 years developing those plans in Montana, 
engaging with our state BLM, multiple years working our state 
plan. We are in the process of implementing those plans, and 
believe that the next 3 years is most profitable, working 
together with our Federal partners toward the 2020 consistency 
review by the Service, as opposed to going back into plan 
amendment processes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;of Natural Resources&lt;/paragraph&gt;

empowered best if Congress and the Administration recognize and support 
the long history of bipartisan, state-led collaboration to conserve

the primary convener of diverse stakeholders for decades and have been

The Administration should use all available tools including the

strategies to build consistency. The Administration must exercise due 
diligence and meaningfully consult with states prior to embarking on 
costly and time consuming plan amendments that may spark litigation or 
new petitions for an Endangered Species Act listing. Congress should 
avoid changes that limit the flexibility of Federal agencies to resolve 
conflicts when and where they occur under the Federal plans.
1.  States will continue to be empowered if Congress and the 
Administration recognize and support the long history of states' 
bipartisan collaboration to conserve greater sage-grouse&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Montana has a long history of bipartisan collaboration to conserve 
greater sage-grouse and their habitats. Montana sportsmen, resource 
managers, landowners and other conservation interests have been 
concerned about the status of sage-grouse as far back as the 1950s. 
Similar concerns across the West crystallized in a formal Memorandum of 
Understanding signed by Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Member 
Agencies and Federal natural resource management agencies in 2000. Each 
state committed to convene a work group and craft a plan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Montana adopted its first formal Greater Sage Grouse Management 
Plan in 2005. It was the product of a diverse working group that 
included representatives of Federal and state agencies, tribal 
representatives, private organizations, and the public. The Plan 
charted a path to achieve long-term conservation and enhancement of 
sagebrush steppe that would support not only sage-grouse, but people 
and other wildlife. It created local working groups. As importantly, it 
provided for coordinated management across jurisdictional boundaries 
and development of community support to balance conservation with 
social, cultural, and community values.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;New science, coupled with new or expanded potential threats to 
sage-grouse habitat and populations and litigation prompted Montana to 
update its original 2005 plan. Early in 2013, following efforts in 
Wyoming and other states, Governor Bullock issued Executive Order 2-
2013 creating a diverse citizen-based advisory council. The council was 
directed to gather information, furnish advice, and provide 
recommendations for a state-wide strategy to preclude the need to list 
the greater sage-grouse under the ESA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Private landowners, conservation groups, industry, and state and 
Federal partners worked together intensively for nearly a year. After 
extensive public comment and meetings around the state, the council 
finalized their recommendations. Governor Bullock issued Executive 
Order 10-2014 in 2014 based on their work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Recognizing the value of proactive stewardship and conservation, in 
2015 the Montana Legislature passed the Greater Sage Grouse Stewardship 
Act (Stewardship Act) by an overwhelming bipartisan majority, codifying 
many of the recommendations of the advisory council. The Legislature 
created the Montana Sage Grouse Oversight Team, which has met regularly 
since fall, 2015. Separately, the Montana Legislature appropriated 
funding to implement Montana's Sage Grouse Program and encourage 
voluntary conservation of private lands to address threats. In fact, 
Montana has committed $10 million toward private land conservation. In 
partnership with others thus far, Montana will have protected 72,000 
acres of private land from the threat of cultivation. Additional 
conservation measures have been implemented on private lands through 
Montana Fish, Wildlife &amp;amp; Parks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Governor Bullock issued Executive Order 12-2015 later in 2015 to 
address additional program needs. Taken together, Executive Order 12-
2015 and the Stewardship Act comprise Montana's Conservation Strategy 
(or State Plan). Montana's plan aligns closely with Wyoming's plan, 
only with a greater emphasis on private lands where most of Montana's 
best sage-grouse habitat occurs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Montana has nearly 1,000 leks and an estimated 18 percent of the 
total greater sage-grouse population and nearly 20 percent of the 
rangewide habitat; however, about 78 percent of the occupied range is 
in state, tribal and private landownership. Only 22 percent of the 
occupied range is federally owned and managed in Montana.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Montana takes an ``all lands/all hands'' approach to sage-grouse 
conservation because private lands and state trust lands are 
intermingled with Federal lands in a checkerboard fashion. By working 
with private landowners, conservation groups, industry, and Federal 
agencies, Montana has found a path forward that conserves working 
landscapes and that supports sage-grouse, other wildlife, agriculture, 
economic opportunities for industry, and outdoor recreation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Diverse stakeholders have been at the table every step of the way 
in Montana. They lobbied extensively in support of the Stewardship Act 
in 2015 and continue to be directly engaged with Montana's Sage Grouse 
Program on a regular basis. Moreover, they continue to testify before 
the Montana Legislature and various interim committees to support 
Montana's sage-grouse conservation efforts to this day. They also 
express support for how the Federal plans and the State Plan work 
together and in concert toward Montana's common, shared goal: 
maintaining authority to manage our lands, our economy, and our 
wildlife.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Similar collaborative efforts occurred in other western states, and 
governors have led the way. Along with local citizens and Federal 
partners, states have forged a path that balances economic opportunity 
with conservation. States are committed to maintaining the state and 
Federal conservation efforts developed at the local level, which when 
taken together, will preclude the need to list sage-grouse under ESA 
across its range.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Meaningful consultation and coordination between states and the 
Federal Government has been a hallmark of this effort. Governors have 
consistently demanded that the Department of the Interior offer direct 
and meaningful consultation opportunities given states' track record, 
the commitments of our partners, and the leadership role and 
responsibility states have for managing wildlife. Those expectations 
have been the same, regardless of the administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Given decades of bipartisan work, Congress and the Administration 
must continue to stand behind and respect state efforts and avoid 
actions that unnecessarily polarize the collaborative work of our 
partners. States have consistently requested the Department of the 
Interior work hand in hand with the Western Governors Sage Grouse Task 
Force. Only the governors can speak for whether this consultation is 
adequate. Future policy actions must be developed in concert with the 
states--top down approaches from Washington, DC, whatever their 
intentions, must not be pursued under the guise of state empowerment.
2.  States will continue to be empowered if Congress and the 
Administration avoid policy changes that foster uncertainty and hold 
potential to disproportionately impact individual states&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;In 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS or Service) 
identified habitat loss, fragmentation, and the inadequacy of existing 
regulatory mechanisms to address threats as the key factors leading to 
the determination that ESA protections for the greater sage-grouse were 
warranted. Populations had been in decline for decades and some local 
populations had been extirpated.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\1\ See 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59870 (Oct. 2, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;In September of 2015, the Service concluded that the primary 
threats were ameliorated by conservation efforts implemented by 
Federal, state, and private landowners. Regulatory mechanisms were 
adopted in three state plans and in the Federal land use plans, 
incorporating conservation principles identified by the scientific 
experts to substantially reduce risks through avoidance and 
minimization measures at a landscape scale.\2\ These efforts were 
complimented by voluntary conservation efforts on private lands by 
individual landowners, the NRCS Sage Grouse Initiative, and Candidate 
Conservation Agreements with Assurances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\2\ See 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59874-59882 (Oct. 2, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Along with Wyoming and Oregon, Montana is one of the three states 
that adopted affirmative regulatory mechanisms that addressed threats 
to sage-grouse. In contrast, other states adopted primarily voluntary 
state plans. Federal land use plans filled the gaps across the West 
through sage-grouse specific provisions and land use allocations. 
Federal land use plans provided the high degree of certainty required 
to demonstrate that threats would be reduced across approximately 90 
percent of the breeding habitat and the majority of occupied range 
because common elements were included across the range which avoided 
and minimized disturbance in the remaining large priority blocks of 
habitat, while also providing management flexibility in areas that are 
less critical for conservation.\3\ The Federal plans and state plans 
from Wyoming, Oregon, and Montana provide protective, regulatory 
mechanisms for the majority of the most important habitat for sage-
grouse. All told, the Montana, Wyoming and Oregon plans provide 
assurances for over 56 million acres of occupied range on state, tribal 
and privately-owned lands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\3\ See 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59874-59882, 59928, 59931, 59934 (Oct. 
2, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;The 2015 not warranted finding relies on the foundation of both the 
state and Federal plans. The regulatory nature of state plans from 
Wyoming, Oregon, and Montana provided the greatest degree of certainty 
in addressing threats on state and private lands and were complemented 
by other state plan efforts, and the voluntary work of NRCS with 
private landowners. The Federal plans provided new regulatory 
mechanisms on over half of the occupied sage-grouse range that did not 
exist in 2010 when listing was warranted and sage-grouse became a 
candidate for listing.\4\ The new sage-grouse measures and land use 
allocations adequately addressed threats, and through common elements, 
conserved the most important habitats across the range of the 
species.\5\ All states benefited from the Federal plans contributing to 
habitat conservation and threat abatement in consistent ways across the 
range, regardless of whether individual state plans were regulatory or 
voluntary. This is because the Service analyzed the adequacy of habitat 
conservation measures, threats, and the combined effect of state and 
Federal regulatory mechanisms at a landscape scale and rangewide.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\4\ See 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59873-59882, 59928 (Oct. 2, 2015).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\5\ See 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59874-59882, 59928, 59931, 59934-59936 
(Oct. 2, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Montana believes there are potential legal issues that could arise 
from taking a hasty and narrow view toward changing Federal plans. 
First, a thoughtful analysis is needed to identify elements of the 
Federal plans that were necessary to conserve habitat through avoidance 
and minimization measures in key habitats across the range and that 
were relied upon by the Service when it concluded that listing was not 
warranted in 2015. Any changes that would undercut the efficacy of 
conservation measures to address threats, as measured against the best 
available science, should give us pause to reconsider. Sage-grouse do 
not tolerate habitat loss and fragmentation very well, nor are they 
good pioneers. The science is unambiguous in that regard.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Second, the sum of changes within individual states must be 
analyzed when they are aggregated up to a landscape scale and across 
the range. If the aggregate of changes undercuts that which is 
necessary to address threats adequately and sustain sage-grouse into 
the future, then litigation is not only certain, but a listing is also 
likely. Here, Montana again stresses the need for due diligence and 
meaningful consultation prior to moving forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Montana is very concerned that potential changes to Federal plans 
may erode the very underpinnings that were critical to achieving 
conservation rangewide and that was sufficient to avoid a listing in 
2015. State plans alone are not, and will not ever be, adequate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Montana did however identify a number of areas where plans could be 
improved as part of our governor's consistency review. To date, those 
issues have been addressed through administrative arrangements not 
requiring plan amendment at the state level. Shortsighted, piecemeal 
changes to Federal plans (individually or collectively) would be a step 
back in time to the days when management was focused on administrative 
boundaries alone, not natural resources on a landscape scale. Piecemeal 
changes could impact and fragment larger blocks of known valuable 
habitat, and as a result, could lead to population declines and 
eventual listing. Montana would be disproportionately impacted by such 
a result.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Montana's most valuable sage-grouse habitats occur on private 
lands. In fact, 66 percent of Montana's sage-grouse habitat is 
privately owned. That's 21,582,000 acres. An additional 2.2 million 
acres of sage-grouse habitat is state trust land. All told, about 75 
percent of Montana's sage-grouse live on private and state trust lands. 
For generations, Montana ranchers have knit together grazing 
opportunities on private, state, and Federal lands to sustain their 
families and the integrity of the land.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;The impacts to private landowners and Montana's economy if sage-
grouse were listed would be severe, in both regulatory and pragmatic 
ways. Montana's private landowners should not be forced to carry the 
burden for more than their fair share of the stewardship responsibility 
to preclude or respond to an ESA listing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Habitat conservation for sage-grouse translates to habitat for big 
game. Montana has a deep tradition of hunting on both public and 
private lands. Big game hunting in Montana contributes $324 million 
annually to the Montana economy. In counties that contain designated 
sage-grouse habitats, big game hunters spend over $113.5 million 
annually when hunting Montana's checkerboard landscape.\6\ For these 38 
rural counties, hunter expenditures have significant and positive 
impacts on local economies. Montana's motto of ``think habitat'' 
applies equally to sage-grouse and big game. The state recognizes the 
synergies between sage-grouse conservation, maintaining working 
ranchlands, and supporting our hunting heritage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Sagebrush habitats in the West support over 300 other wildlife 
species, any one of which could be in trouble and heading for the ESA 
emergency room. We have limited data for most of these species, but are 
confident that addressing threats to sage-grouse through habitat 
conservation will take care of them, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Congress and this Administration can empower states by fully 
funding Federal agencies to implement their missions and respective 
land management plans. The existing Federal plans account for the 
complexity of managing millions of acres at a landscape scale and 
endeavor to balance multiple use mandates with conservation. This work 
is expensive, but critical to sustaining future energy development and 
outdoor recreation over the long haul. Farm Bill conservation programs 
remain critical to sage-grouse conservation on working lands and must 
continue to receive adequate funding.
3.  States can be supported by efforts to adaptively implement land use 
plans to address changing conditions, use the best available science 
and build consistency across ownerships with state conservation 
strategies&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;In July of 2015, Montana voiced a number of concerns regarding 
potential issues with the BLM sage-grouse plans in our governor's 
consistency review letter. We continue to see the need for improvement 
and consistency in some areas. However, we have also learned a lot in 
the first 2 years of implementing the state and Federal plans. Many 
issues flagged at the outset in 2015 have either not materialized or 
have not proven to be insurmountable. We have found ways to address 
them administratively and expect to find new ways in the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;For example, Montana BLM now implements Montana's disturbance cap 
threshold of 5 percent. This has been or soon will be institutionalized 
through a new Instructional Memorandum from the BLM State Office. The 
state and Montana BLM now take the same analytic approach to range 
improvement projects. Going even further, conversations have already 
begun in Montana about increasing training and collaboration between 
BLM and livestock producers. This would ensure consistent and effective 
implementation of the plans while also providing needed flexibility for 
local managers to implement science-based management at the local site 
scale in an ecologically meaningful way that's appropriate for Montana 
habitats. It also provides certainty for ranching families. Federal 
land use plans were always expected to evolve based on changing needs 
and circumstances. We have already seen that in Montana, and we will 
continue to adapt and resolve issues locally in the future. A 
commitment to flexibly address conflicts when and where they occur is a 
cornerstone of Montana's Greater Sage Grouse Plan and has proven to be 
a tenant that has been supported by our Federal agency partners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Nonetheless, there are areas where alignment could still be 
improved. But it is equally important that we analyze and exhaust the 
full range of administrative tools to address inconsistencies and 
resolve conflicts before resorting to lengthy, costly plan amendments 
under NEPA. Once more, it is equally important that we ensure that any 
new proposed changes to the Federal sage-grouse plans not create 
further inconsistencies with state policy. Top down policy from 
Washington, DC holds potential to further exacerbate the 
inconsistencies with state and Federal efforts rather than resolve 
them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Montana believes the most efficient approach to address concerns is 
to look at the full spectrum of tools, ranging from public outreach to 
staff training, instructional memoranda at the national and state 
levels, and maintenance actions to existing plans. In short, we can 
best move forward by refining the existing plans. It is imperative that 
we avoid prolonged and unnecessary work that would unravel the 
foundation of the 2015 ``not warranted'' finding to the point that we 
all risk a result we worked so hard to avoid. Adaptive implementation 
of the plans can reduce uncertainty for our partners, industry, and 
working ranch families who take care of the land and the wildlife on 
our behalf and can help address inconsistencies efficiently. While 
properly vetted, limited plan amendments may be needed to address 
concerns over time, Montana believes most conflicts can be addressed in 
the near term through other means.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to share Montana's perspective. We 
look forward to continuing our work with Congress and the 
Administration to improve certainty, address inconsistencies with state 
policy through adaptive actions, and support the collaboration among 
diverse partners that resulted in the 2015 not warranted finding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;______
Questions Submitted for the Record by Rep. Grijalva to Mr. John Tubbs, 
  Director of Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Question 1. Wildfire is a concern throughout greater sage-grouse 
habitat. Secretary Jewell issued Secretary Order 3336 in 2015 to 
address this concern and develop, in partnership with Federal and state 
agencies, working guidelines and plans that break the cycle of 
spreading invasive, non-native grasses after wildfires. In 2016, 
Jewell's Interior Department issued the Integrated Rangeland Fire 
Management Strategy Actionable Science Plan. Do you believe Secretary 
Jewell's response was timely and appropriate? Do you believe it would 
be wise to stick with this approach rather than roll it back or 
substitute range management that is not based on sound science? Can you 
discuss these wildfire planning efforts and what is being done across 
the West to restore the sagebrush ecosystem?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Answer. Yes. The Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy 
(Strategy) and the Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy 
Actionable Science Plan (Science Plan) represent affirmative actions 
that can be taken by local, state, and Federal agencies to address 
wildfire, which is a primary threat to sagebrush ecosystems. The threat 
of habitat loss and fragmentation due to wildfire is particularly acute 
and serious in the Great Basin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Development of both the Strategy and the Science Plan was timely, 
appropriate, and essential to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(USFWS) 2015 determination that listing the Greater Sage Grouse (GRSG) 
was not warranted.\1\ Without these documents, there would be little, 
if any, coordinated and dedicated approach to addressing the 
significant and stochastic wildfire threat that evades all state and 
Federal regulatory mechanisms. Ongoing implementation and adaptive 
refinement should continue in the future. The Strategy is proactive and 
has utility throughout the West, not just states with greater sage-
grouse populations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\1\ See 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59906-59908 (Oct. 2, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Wildfire kills sagebrush and results in the direct loss of 
sagebrush habitat upon which GRSG depend. In 2010, the USFWS identified 
wildfire as one of the primary factors linked to GRSG declines due to 
the long-term loss of sagebrush and conversion of sagebrush steppe 
habitats to invasive annual grasses such as cheatgrass. At that time, 
USFWS determined that GRSG warranted listing under the Endangered 
Species Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Fire intensity and frequency had been increasing due to the 
establishment of a positive feedback loop between increasing wildfires, 
elimination of sagebrush, and subsequent invasion and establishment of 
cheatgrass--which itself acts as a fine fire fuel leading to increased 
fire intensity and frequency and further precluding re-establishment of 
sagebrush. Development of the Strategy and Science Plan was in direct 
response to the 2010 finding, which identified the lack of any 
integrated fire strategy and concluded that gaps in scientific 
knowledge were problematic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;The USFWS relied on the Strategy and Science Plan documents, as 
well as their implementation, when analyzing the threat of habitat loss 
and fragmentation due to wildfire in order to reach its conclusion that 
listing was not warranted in 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Addressing the threat of wildfire and annual invasive grasses is 
vital to long-term GRSG conservation. This is clearly set forth in the 
USFWS administrative record going back at least 10 to 15 years. The 
negative impacts of fire on GRSG and its sagebrush habitat are also 
long supported in the scientific, peer-reviewed literature.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;For example, in the absence of the Strategy and Science Plan and 
under the current burn rates, about 17-25 percent of GRSG range within 
the Great Basin could be impacted in the next 20-30 years. Without 
affirmatively managing wildfire response and restoration, wildfire and 
invasive plants could cause GRSG abundance to decline by 43 percent 
over the next 30 years.\2\ This has important implications for long-
term conservation of the species over a significant portion of its 
range.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\2\ See 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59900 (Oct. 2, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;The Strategy outlined a long-term approach to better prevent and 
suppress wildfire through improved efficiency and efficacy of response 
and restoration of fire-impacted areas. Even while maintaining the 
safety of firefighters and preserving the efficiency of operations, the 
Strategy prioritized the protection, conservation, and restoration of 
the sagebrush steppe ecosystems particularly for GRSG.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Quite simply, states and Federal agencies share a common goal to 
reduce the size, severity and cost of rangeland wildfires. The Strategy 
concluded that a coordinated, science-based adaptive management 
approach was needed. One of the action items specifically called for 
enhancing the capability, capacity, and utilization of non-Federal 
wildlife fire assets and organizations so that local communities were 
in a better position to provide local protection. Rural Fire Protection 
Associations were specifically mentioned. The Strategy also called for 
a coordinated approach to positioning fire-management resources to 
improve fire response and post-fire restoration actions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;The Strategy also identified the need for and recommended 
development of an actionable science plan to improve knowledge, reduce 
uncertainty and provide better tools for local communities, livestock 
grazing permittees, and on-the-ground fire and natural resource 
managers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;The Science Plan was completed in 2016. It was developed by a 
multi-disciplinary team comprised of state and Federal experts in their 
respective fields. The document: (1) prioritizes research needs to fill 
current knowledge gaps; (2) connects scientists with fire and natural 
resource managers so managers can make informed decisions and achieve 
management objectives; and (3) creates a process to fund the needed 
science, implement research, and communicate results.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Specifically, the Science Plan prioritized a total of 37 science 
needs--areas where more research is needed: 8 are specific to fire; 6 
are specific to invasives; 10 are related to restoration; 9 are 
specific to sagebrush and GRSG; and 4 that are related to climate and 
weather. A key emphasis of the Science Plan is to get information and 
tools to on-the-ground fire and land managers so they can make better 
decisions and achieve better outcomes with, and on behalf of, local 
communities. One example where new science has direct application to 
management is a recent study that found that annual wildfire risk 
across the Great Basin can be modeled and predicted based on 
precipitation patterns alone (e.g. consecutive wet years followed by 
consecutive dry years). This information can be applied ahead of each 
fire season to adjust wildfire preparedness or plan fuel treatments as 
appropriate.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\3\ See Pilliod, D.S., Welty, J.L. and Arkle, R.S. 2017. Refining 
the cheatgrass-fire cycle in the Great Basin: precipitation timing and 
fine fuel composition predict wildfire trends. Ecology and Evolution, 
1-26.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;With respect to invasives, annual exotic grasses like cheatgrass 
are more prevalent in the Great Basin than the Rocky Mountain 
States.\4\ Absent cheatgrass, many sagebrush ecosystems have 
experienced frequent fire return intervals but exhibited resilience to 
mixed-severity fires common across the West. Range management through 
livestock grazing alone, even if it were infallible, will not be 
sufficient to address habitat loss and fragmentation due to wildfire at 
the necessary scale. Wildfire risk is compounded by unfavorable soil 
and moisture regimes regionally, due to low resistance to fire in the 
first instance, as well as by growing conditions at localized scales in 
any given year. In addition to well-managed grazing practices, 
eradication of invasives such as cheatgrass and restoration of native 
species is required to foster resilience to changing conditions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\4\ See 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59898-59900 (Oct. 2, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;An estimated 2,070,451 acres of GRSG burned in 2017 across the 11 
western states. In Nevada alone, approximately 965,567 acres burned. 
The total number of acres burned rangewide in 2017 is up substantially 
from 2016 (626,268 acres) and 2015 (562,734 acres). It unrealistic to 
think that grazing regimes can effectively reverse soil moisture 
patterns, improve resistance to fire, and align weather and climatic 
trends to neutralize the fact that large portions of GRSG range is 
already predisposed to significant wildfire, particularly in the Great 
Basin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;About 54 percent of GRSG breeding habitat in substantial portions 
of Nevada and Utah is classified as having a low resistance to wildfire 
and invasion by exotic species. Range management at that scale is not 
commensurate with the response necessary to truly address the threat of 
more frequent and intense wildfire.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Ameliorating the risk of habitat loss and fragmentation due to 
wildfire at the scale necessary to ensure that listing is never 
warranted requires a more direct, concerted approach--like the Strategy 
and the Science Plan. Continued implementation of both the Strategy and 
the Science Plan is needed to reduce future losses of sagebrush 
habitats, successfully restore that which does burn, and to break the 
cheatgrass invasion-wildfire cycle. To be successful at addressing the 
primary threat of wildfire, managers need to make scientifically 
informed decisions. These documents are scientifically sound.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Last, the Western Governors' Association (WGA) National Forest and 
Rangeland Management Initiative was launched in July 2016 under Montana 
Governor Steve Bullock's tenure as Chair. This Initiative will 
ultimately lead to valuable administrative and legislative 
recommendations for improving forest and rangeland management. The 
goals of the initiative are to:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Examine existing forest and rangeland management&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;authorities and programs to determine their strengths and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;weaknesses;&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;A Report was issued in June of 2017.\5\ Based upon the input from 
state and Federal land managers, private landowners, local governments, 
businesses and non-governmental organizations, WGA sought to identify 
best practices and offer recommendations that put western states on a 
path toward healthier, more resilient ecosystems, while continuing to 
support diverse economic opportunities for western communities. The 
Report's findings and recommendations speak to many of the same themes 
raised in the Strategy document: the need for improved collaboration 
and coordination with respect to regional land management challenges 
and opportunities for restoration. The Report also calls for the 
application of the best available science. The Science Plan charts a 
path to fill important knowledge gaps.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;\5\ See Special Report: Western Governors' National Forest and 
Rangeland Management Initiative. June 2017 (available at: http: / / 
westgov.org/reports/national-forest-and-rangeland-management-
initiative-special-report).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;During the Initiative's second year, Western Governors will be 
primarily focused on the implementation of recommendations in the First 
Year Report, within their own states, collaboratively through WGA and 
with the U.S. Congress. Opportunities to further refine the Integrated 
Rangeland Fire Management Strategy and the Actionable Science Plan may 
be identified.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Question 2. A 2013 study conducted by scientists at Oregon State 
University and published in the Journal of Applied Ecology found that 
``cattle grazing reduces invasion resistance [to cheatgrass]'' and 
``exacerbates [cheatgrass] dominance in one of North America's must 
endangered ecosystems''--the sagebrush steppe. In light of that fact, 
do you agree with other witnesses that increased grazing is the best 
way to reduce cheatgrass invasions and wildfire potential?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Answer. No. Historically speaking, improper grazing and severe 
drought affected the sagebrush ecosystem and GRSG habitat across the 
West. Grazing that was inconsistent with local ecological conditions, 
coupled with other disturbance pressures reduced the vigor of native 
rangeland plants and resistance to invasion by exotic annual species 
like cheatgrass. Long-term changes in plant communities and soils 
resulted so that exotic annual grasses like cheatgrass flourished. 
These shifts permanently changed the ecological trajectory of 
rangelands that were historically overgrazed because thresholds of 
recovery by native perennial species were crossed. The entire plant 
community structure shifted. Now, these areas are more prone to 
wildfire, as discussed above.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Carefully prescribed livestock grazing in the spring or late fall 
may be effective in controlling cheatgrass in small, localized areas. 
This is in combination with other methods of control. The goal is to 
prevent cheatgrass from producing seeds while at the same time not 
impacting desirable native perennial vegetation through overgrazing. 
Preventing seed production should reduce the number of seeds in the 
soil overall, as seeds only remain viable for about 2 to 3 years. Also, 
maintaining the vigor of desirable perennial species and preventing 
soil disturbance helps prevent cheatgrass invasion and expansion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;However, a blanket increase in grazing is not the best way to 
reduce cheatgrass invasions and potential for wildfire. This is because 
cheatgrass is only palatable as livestock forage during the early 
spring green-up period, not season long. After a certain point in the 
growing season, it is no longer suitable for livestock grazing and 
livestock may then overgraze desirable species. Once grazed, 
cheatgrass' residual growth (from early spring through to when seeds 
are set and the plant cures) will eventually become the fine fuel which 
carries wildfire.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;The upshot is that cheatgrass is not palatable forage for a long 
enough period of time, nor can it be grazed intensively enough to 
actually reduce the frequency of fire, its intensity, or its behavior. 
Quite the opposite is true. Cheatgrass thrives in disturbance. The 
greater the disturbance, the more it thrives. The relationship between 
fire frequency, intensity, and behavior and cheatgrass cannot be 
explained alone, nor will it be strongly influenced by, livestock 
grazing at the scales necessary for conservation of sagebrush 
landscapes and GRSG. As noted above, as cheatgrass abundance increases, 
wildfires become more frequent and more intense. Native perennial 
rangeland plant species are lost eventually, leaving a near monoculture 
of cheatgrass, ripe for recurring wildfires.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Tubbs "&gt;Rather than a blanket increase in grazing, most rangeland 
management and noxious weed professionals recommend targeted grazing to 
avoid negative impacts to livestock performance and range conditions 
and further recommend that targeted grazing be complemented with an 
integrated strategy for invasive control and restoration. Careful, 
targeted grazing is one tool among many that may help reduce the 
impacts of invasive species and wildfire.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

only a Commission Chairman, but also, I think, Chairman of the 
Ecosystem Council in Nevada.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA, DVM, CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;You are recognized for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;EUREKA COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, EUREKA, NEVADA&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;Dr. Goicoechea. Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, 
and members of the Committee, my name is Dr. J.J. Goicoechea, 
and I am a fourth-generation cattle producer from Eureka, 
Nevada. I am the current Vice Chair of the National Cattlemen's 
Beef Association Federal Lands Committee, and the Chairman of 
the Eureka County Board of County Commissioners. It is a 
pleasure to testify before you today regarding empowering 
state-based management for the greater sage-grouse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;A fundamental question before us today is what is being 
done today at local and state levels that benefits the recovery 
of the greater sage-grouse. It should be no surprise that 
western states are actively implementing plans within their 
respective borders that are having positive impacts on 
habitats.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;In 2013, Nevada took a major step in providing for the 
management and recovery of the greater sage-grouse. The 
creation of the Nevada Sagebrush Ecosystem Council by the 
Nevada Legislature during that session demonstrated Nevada's 
commitment to the long-term management of the sagebrush 
ecosystem and the species that rely upon it. These species 
include the multiple-use industries dependent upon those same 
ecosystems for their survival.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;Nevada, like most other western states, developed a state-
specific plan for the conservation of the greater sage-grouse. 
It contained state-specific goals and objectives, and was 
intended to be the preferred alternative for the 2015 Nevada, 
Northeastern California land use plan amendment. Instead, a 
broader cookie-cutter approach was taken by the Federal 
agencies. In an attempt to find consistency in the West, the 
Department of the Interior greatly overlooked the fact that no 
two states are exactly alike, no two states have the exact same 
threats and impacts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;The arbitrary designation of millions of acres of sagebrush 
focal areas and further restricting the very activities that 
made these areas the best of the best is an example of over-
reach and a top-down approach to management that has failed in 
the past, and will only harm populations of sage-grouse if left 
in place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;Similar to my counterparts, the major threats in Nevada to 
the greater sage-grouse are fire and invasive species. Nevada 
is working diligently with the BLM in an attempt to limit the 
size and severity of wildfires in our state, and to better 
manage invasive species. But we continue to encounter hurdles 
as we work to decrease invasive annual grass.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;The vast majority of these hurdles at the district office 
level arise from the 2015 LUPAs, including the habitat 
objectives contained in Table 2.2. This table, while perhaps 
ideally what sage-grouse would like to have for habitat, is 
being used as nothing more than a tool to further limit 
multiple use on Federal lands, and in the process is allowing 
for fuel loading and the continued spread of invasive species.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;This last summer, a prime example of this occurred in 
Nevada. A ranching operation asked for a period of time to 
leave their cattle on beyond their permit, due to an increased 
fuel load from two back-to-back record winners. The request was 
denied, the cattle were moved, and on July 9 at 4:00 p.m. in 
the afternoon the Rooster Comb Fire ignited. Before it was 
contained, 220,000 acres of sage-grouse habitat had burned in 
Elko, Lander, and Eureka Counties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;While the birds in that area of the Rooster Comb Fire may 
have ideally wanted 7 inches of deep-rooted perennials and 25 
percent forb cover, today they have 220,000 acres of zero 
cover, no perennial plants, and another attempt to restore 
burned habitat begins with the issuance of livestock grazing 
closures for that area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;As you can see from my written testimony, Nevada is clearly 
aware of the threats to our state. We are committed to helping 
our Federal land management partners, and we have the statutory 
authority within the Sage Brush Ecosystem Council to coordinate 
with Federal agencies. The creation of the Nevada State Plan 
was an example of collaboration and coordination among all 
groups.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;If there is still a perception that there is a lack of 
regulatory mechanism in place for protecting the greater sage-
grouse, let me say it is not a lack of regulatory mechanisms, 
it is the wrong regulatory mechanisms. Why don't we listen to 
state and local officials that implement plans that were 
developed at the ground level?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="THE HON. J.J. GOICOECHEA"&gt;The top-down approach has squeezed public land industries, 
all while continuing to lose sensitive habitats and imperil 
wildlife species. If the true goal is conservation, put it back 
in the hands of those closest to the land. If the goal instead 
is to remove economic drivers from rural communities and there 
is no desire to protect habitats, then we can continue on the 
path that we are on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Goicoechea follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Prepared Statement of Julian Joseph (J.J.) Goicoechea on behalf of 
Public Lands Council, Nevada Cattlemen's Association, and Eureka County&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;Nevada&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and members of the 
Subcommittee, my name is J.J. Goicoechea and I am a fourth generation 
cattle producer from Eureka, Nevada. I am a past president of the 
Nevada Cattlemen's Association and currently serve on the Executive 
Committee for that organization and I am the current Vice-Chair of the 
National Cattlemen's Beef Association Federal Lands Committee. In 
addition, I am in my second term as a Eureka County Nevada Commissioner 
and currently serve as chairman of the board. In 2013 I was appointed 
to represent Local Government on the Nevada Sagebrush Ecosystem Council 
and last year I was reappointed to a second term. I have been honored 
to serve as the chairman of the SEC since its creation. It is a 
pleasure to testify before you today regarding empowering state based 
management for the greater sage-grouse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;A fundamental question before us today is what is being done at the 
local and state levels now that benefits the ``recovery'' of the 
greater sage-grouse. It should be no surprise that western states are 
actively implementing plans within their respective states that are 
having positive impacts on habitats. In 2013, Nevada took a major step 
in providing for the management and recovery of the greater sage-
grouse. The creation of the Nevada Sagebrush Ecosystem Council by the 
Nevada Legislature during the 2013 regular session demonstrated 
Nevada's commitment to the long-term management of the sagebrush 
ecosystem and the species that rely upon it. These species include the 
multi-use industries that rely upon this same ecosystem for their 
survival. Nevada Revised Statute 232.162, the chapter establishing the 
Nevada Sagebrush Ecosystem Council, reads in part;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;7. The Council shall:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;(a) Consider the best science available in its determinations&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;regarding and conservation of the greater sage grouse&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;(Centrocerus urophasianus) and sagebrush ecosystems in this&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;State;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;(b) Establish and carry out strategies for:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;(1) The conservation of the greater sage grouse and sagebrush&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;ecosystems in this State;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;(h) Coordinate and facilitate discussion among persons, federal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;and state agencies, and local government concerning the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;maintenance of sagebrush ecosystems and the conservation of the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;greater sage-grouse;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;Nevada, much like most other western states, developed a State Plan 
for the conservation of the greater sage-grouse. This plan, entitled 
the 2014 Nevada Greater Sage Grouse Conservation Plan was adopted 
October 1, 2014 and updated April and May of 2015. The Nevada plan 
contains specific goals and objectives for Nevada. It also identified 
state specific threats to the greater sage-grouse and the sagebrush 
ecosystem. The Nevada plan was intended to be the preferred alternative 
in the 2015 Nevada and Northeastern California Land Use Plan Amendment 
by the Bureau of Land Management. Instead, a broader cookie cutter 
approach was taken by the Federal agencies. In an attempt to find 
``consistency'' in the West, the Department of the Interior greatly 
overlooked the fact that no two states are exactly alike, no two states 
have the exact same threats and impacts. Even within states, the 
threats vary among geography location, elevation, and land management 
agencies, etc. In addition, many habitats and populations of sage-
grouse are stable. A robust plan should include the protection of these 
areas and birds in addition to providing lift to others in need. The 
arbitrary designation of millions of acres as Sagebrush Focal Areas and 
further restricting the very activities that made these areas the best 
of best is an example of over-reach and a top down approach to 
management that has failed in the past and will only harm populations 
of sage-grouse if left in place. At no time did the state of Nevada 
endorse or advocate for a special land designation. The Sagebrush 
Ecosystem Council recognizes the importance of quality habitat and is 
ultimately responsible for its protection and enhancement. Restricting 
activities lessens the value of credits created in Nevada's 
Conservation Credit System and actually deters enrollment in protective 
actions that would benefit the sage-grouse for generations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;Nevada can't carry out our own legislatively mandated management of 
sage-grouse and habitat in our state because the Federal agencies 
elected to once again take a heavy handed top down approach to 
management. Wildlife is the responsibility of the state in which they 
reside. If a species is not on the Endangered Species List, it should 
be the state making decisions for the species.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;The major threats to the GS in Nevada are fire and invasive species 
that often invade the ecosystem after fire. Nevada is working 
diligently with the BLM in an attempt to limit the size and severity of 
wildland fires in our state and to better manage invasive species. We 
continue to encounter hurdles as we work to decrease fuel loading 
invasive annual grass seed loads. The vast majority of these hurdles at 
the District Office level arise from the 2015 LUPAs. Habitat objectives 
for the GS included in the LUPAs are a recipe for disaster when 
considering their impacts on fire behavior. Grazing allotments in SG 
habitat need to meet the objectives contained in Table 2.2. This table, 
while perhaps ideally what SG would like to have for habitat is nothing 
more than a tool to further limit multiple use on Federal lands, and in 
the process allow for fuel loading and the continues spread of invasive 
species. How can the driest state in the Nation address its top threat 
to SG, fire, when a table being used by BLM employees to manage lands 
is defining habitat as having a minimum of 7 inches of droop height. 
When managing for a native deep rooted perineal plant to have 7 inches 
of height in the summer months, what do you think we are also managing 
for?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;It is no secret that cheatgrass is the Number one invasive plant 
threat in Nevada today. Cheatgrass greens up early, ahead of native 
perineal plants and takes the nutrients and water from the soil before 
the native plants growing season. As we wait idly by with our rulers 
and yard sticks, hoping the native grasses get to 7 inches, hoping we 
maintain a canopy cover of shrubs for nesting, we are allowing gasoline 
to grow unchecked. By June, the cheatgrass is over a foot tall in 
places, it is cured, meaning seed heads have developed, it is no longer 
palatable to animals and it waves in the wind waiting for a spark. When 
the spark comes, Nevada's Number one threat to sage-grouse and sage-
grouse habitat once again devastates the ecosystem. Fires of 200,000 
acres plus gobble up islands of previously unburned habitat and 
annihilate restoration efforts in old burn scars. We are seeing the 
same areas burn again and again. What is the first step taken when this 
happens? Remove the one tool that could have prevented severity of the 
fires in the first place, grazing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;This last summer a prime example of this occurred in Nevada. Late 
spring a ranching operation asked the BLM if they could stay on an 
allotment for a few more weeks beyond the permit. The reason for this 
was that a large buildup of fuel due to two back to back record winters 
was being seen. The ranching operation knew this fuel loading was going 
to be an issue and they had livestock there and were willing to make 
changes in order to help. The answer from the agency was no. The fear 
of litigation by doing something outside a set a sideboards drives 
decisions like this daily. So despite repeated requests to stay longer 
and reduce fuel, the livestock were moved. The Rooster Comb Fire 
ignited on Sunday, July 9 at 4:00 p.m. Before it was contained, it 
burned nearly 220,000 acres of sage-grouse habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;Now large fires were not unusual this summer, but this fire was the 
result of repeated attempts to rehabilitate an area that has burned 
numerous times over the past few decades. Livestock grazing had been 
excluded from the area during recent rehabilitation efforts and this 
year grazing was allowed, but as mentioned above, not effectively to 
help alleviate the Number one threat to sage-grouse in Nevada. So while 
the birds in the area of the Rooster Comb Fire may very well have 
ideally wanted 7 inches of deep rooted perineal plants across the 
landscape with at least 25 percent shrub cover, they now have 220,000 
acres of zero cover, no perineal plants, and another attempt to restore 
burned habitat begins with the issuance of a livestock grazing closure 
decision for the area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;The Nevada State Plan under the threat of Wildfire and Invasive 
Species lists Objective 1.1: Reduce the amount of sage-grouse habitat 
loss due to large acreage wildfires and invasion or potential 
domination by non-native plants.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;Pre-suppression&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;In order to address the threat of fire and invasive plants,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;which continues to challenge land managers throughout the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;western United States, the State proposes a paradigm shift.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;This entails a shift in focus from the current suppression-&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;centric approach to a more nuanced, cost effective and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;proactive approach focusing on pre-suppression activities;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;The second significant threat to sage-grouse habitat in Nevada is 
Pinion Juniper Encroachment. This is a threat isolated to the Great 
Basin for the most part. In the Nevada Plan, our state lays out 
objectives and actions to tackle the continued spread of Pinion Juniper 
into our sagebrush ecosystems. To date thousands of acres of invasive 
Pinion Juniper have been removed from predominately private property. 
The red tape associated with getting NEPA done on public lands once 
again is limiting how effective treatments can actually be. The west 
slope of the Diamond Mountains looks like a patchwork quilt with nearly 
every acre of private property treated for Pinion Juniper and vast 
expanses of public lands remaining untreated. We need to keep in mind 
that sage-grouse will not use habitat that has over 4 percent pinion 
juniper on it per some reports. While private property owners continue 
to leverage grants and expend private dollars to match, and even create 
leks in some cases, to have meaningful watershed wide improvement, we 
need the Federal agencies to remove the red tape, come to the table 
with state and local officials, and spend dollars on meaningful 
projects to better habitat, slow fire spread, decrease fire intensity, 
and bolster our rural economies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;As you can see, Nevada is clearly aware of the threats to our 
state, we are clearly committed to helping our Federal land management 
partners and we have the statutory authority within the Sagebrush 
Ecosystem Council to coordinate with Federal and state agencies. The 
creation of the Nevada State Plan was an example of collaboration and 
coordination among all groups. The nine (9) voting members representing 
conservation and environmental issues, the Board of Wildlife 
Commissioners, local government, Native American tribes, mining, 
energy, agriculture, general public and ranching consulted with and 
considered input by ex-officio members of the council. The ex-officio 
members were the State Directors of BLM, United States Fish and 
Wildlife and Natural Resource Conservation Service, the State 
Supervisor for the Humboldt Toiyabe National Forest, the Directors of 
Nevada Department of Wildlife, Nevada Department of Agriculture, and 
Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Hundreds of 
hours of public comment was accepted and a balanced plan was created 
that will protect the greater sage-grouse, its habitats, all the while 
preserving the economies of rural Nevada.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Goicoechea "&gt;If there is still a perception that there is a ``lack of regulatory 
mechanisms'' in place for protecting the greater sage-grouse, I will 
state as I have in numerous public meetings, it isn't a lack of 
regulatory mechanisms it's the wrong regulatory mechanisms. Insanity is 
doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome. 
Why don't we listen to state and local officials and implement plans 
that were developed at the ground level? The top down approach has 
continued to squeeze public land industries all while continuing to 
lose sensitive habitats and imperil wildlife species. If the true goal 
is conservations, put it back in the hands of those closest to the 
land. If the goal instead is to remove economic drivers from rural 
communities with no desire to protect habitats, then continue on the 
path we are on. We have a tremendous head start at that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

that actually the case?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;Dr. Goicoechea. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Congressman. 
There was coordination and cooperation, if you will. But those 
have become buzz words. We need to stop checking the box, we 
need to stop holding meetings to say that we are coordinating 
and cooperating with local and state agencies, and we need to 
get down to actually using what they presented.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;    While they did take input, I think you can see from the 
final documents that they were not seriously considered. Again, 
they wanted uniformity across the West, they took bits and 
pieces, but they did not use the state-specific or local-
specific recommendations, as they should have under FLPMA.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lamborn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;OK, thank you. And then for you, or Mr. Bird,
or Mr. Bedke, or all three of you, my home state of Colorado 
has spent more than $10 million, set aside 130,000 acres for 
habitat, and is developing a mitigation marketplace, all for 
protecting the sage-grouse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;    Some people have expressed fears to me that Secretary 
Zinke's recent order, S.O. 3353, will somehow make the sage-
grouse more likely to be listed as threatened or endangered, 
thus negating the commendable efforts of states like Colorado 
and your states. Are those fears surrounding Secretarial Order 
3353 well founded?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Congressman, I don't think those
fears are very well-founded at all. And while I don't know the 
specifics of the Colorado plan, I do know the specifics of the 
Idaho plan. The Idaho plan came about as a direct result of 
then-Secretary Salazar coming to Idaho, asking us to put 
together all of the stakeholders, and coming to a consensus-
based sage-grouse plan, one that worked for Idaho. I am 
assuming a similar process happened in Colorado.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;This plan went on to be blessed by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. Again, all under the Obama administration and 
then-Secretary Salazar. It became the preferred alternative 
with the BLM.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Yet, then there was a change at the Secretarial level, and 
all of our plans went out the window. Overlaid on top of them 
were all of these withdrawals, some of which are encompassed in 
Secretary Zinke's removal. Everything that they are worried 
about was stuff that was on top of already federally approved 
state management plans. So, they went over and above, at least 
in our case, and that is where the rub is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    We reached consensus in Idaho with this broad group. All of 
the stakeholders were in the room from Day 1 until the very 
end, and we did not quit until we had consensus. As a result, 
again, it was blessed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it 
was a co-preferred plan from BLM, and then it was jettisoned.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lamborn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;Mr. Bird?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;Mr. Goicoechea?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;Dr. Goicoechea. Thank you. Secretarial Order 3353 did dive 
down in and take a look at some of these inconsistencies and 
asked for those to be brought back to the Secretary of the 
Interior. I think it is critical that we recognize we need to 
collect the data from these states that shows that we are 
protecting habitat, and what the bird populations are doing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;    We will need that data for the 2020 data call, when the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service again decides on the status of 
the greater sage-grouse. And much like Idaho, Nevada's plan 
was, in fact, endorsed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
and our state director was an active participant in the Sage 
Brush Ecosystem Council at every meeting and helped us 
construct that plan to what their wants and desires were for 
the bird.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lamborn&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;Thank you all for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt;Grijalva.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt;    OK, Ms. Tsongas.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Tsongas&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. More than 2 years
ago, the Department of the Interior announced that, thanks to 
unprecedented, proactive partnerships between our Federal land 
management agencies, 11 western states which you represent in 
part today, sportsmen, ranchers, farmers, and conservationists, 
the greater sage-grouse does not need protections under the 
Endangered Species Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt;This very significant achievement was possible thanks to 
years of on-the-ground collaborations and Federal land 
management plans that conserve sagebrush habitat, while 
simultaneously providing predictability for economic 
development, something we all care about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt;The Federal land management plans are based on plans 
developed by each state, not one-size-fits-all, but individual 
plans to suit each state's individual needs. And it was these 
very partnerships that made it possible for the Fish and 
Wildlife Service to conclude in 2015 that the greater sage-
grouse does not need to be listed as endangered or threatened 
under the Endangered Species Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt;The Trump administration's effort to overturn the Federal 
land management plans, I believe, is putting all of these 
efforts at risk, creating uncertainty for those working on the 
ground to conserve this iconic species and its habitat, and 
increasing the likelihood that the species will need to be 
listed under the Endangered Species Act, something we all want 
to avoid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt;    Mr. Tubbs, thank you for being here. You mentioned in your 
written testimony that Montana has a motto of ``Think 
Habitat.'' Why is focusing on habitat the best way to approach 
conservation of the sage-grouse?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Mr. Chairman, thank you, Congressman. What we do
know about sage-grouse, especially in Montana, since that is 
where I come from, is if you have quality habitat, the birds 
will survive. Populations will go up and down over years. The 
trend had been down. We are improving, most recently. But if 
you have good-quality habitat, you can assure that the 
population will remain and grow into the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    The biggest threat in Montana, as opposed to the prior 
testimony, is fragmentation of that habitat, not fire.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Tsongas&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt; So, then, what would your thoughts be on some
of the sort of proposed alternatives to habitat-focused 
conservation, such as setting specific population targets or 
running a sage-grouse captive breeding program? What are your 
thoughts about those possible alternatives?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Congresswoman, while we certainly
track population of sage-grouse, and also do lek counts every 
year, the populations vary year to year. One wet spring 
snowfall at the wrong time, and your brood will die and will 
lose all the population of that year, or a lot of it. Then it 
will take several years to rebound. So, any one given year is 
concerning to us, because we might fall into ESA restrictions 
because of a bad spring.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Instead, we think that quality habitat is a better measure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    Excuse me, what was the second part of the question?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Tsongas&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt; The second part was captive breeding programs.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt; Captive breeding? Captive breeding, and you can
read all the literature, is not a useful tool in sage-grouse 
conservation. It has not been successful, and is limited to 
remnant populations. I do know Alberta is trying it, but again, 
it is a very small, marginal tool.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Tsongas&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt;One of the things I have become aware of in
Montana, you have the significant challenge of having 78 
percent of the state sage-grouse habitat spread across state, 
tribal, and private lands. But despite that, you have been able 
to create the all lands/all hands approach, as you call it, 
bringing all these diverse stakeholders to the table.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt;    What keeps these partnerships together at a time when the 
Trump administration is seeking to upend the existing plans? 
What holds you all together?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Congresswoman, we have actively
kept the coalition together. Our plan is not a static plan. We 
are implementing it now with those stakeholders. And we have an 
Audubon to land trust to oil and gas industry and coal industry 
at the table. We have a common motivation: to conserve the bird 
and make sure that Montana has an economy. With those two 
goals, we are working together quite well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    Ultimately, maybe plan amendments will be needed, but right 
now let's do implementation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Tsongas&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. Tsongas"&gt; Thank you for your testimony. It sounds to me
like the existing framework established by the states focused 
on habitat protection and restoration is certainly working in 
Montana, and is the best chance we have of protecting the 
species from extinction or being listed under the Endangered 
Species Act. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt;Wittman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt;Dr. Wittman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank 
our panelists for joining us today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt;This is a great opportunity to recognize the importance of 
state management plans and the critical role that they play in 
preserving species. And also understanding how, in the past, 
Federal management plans, I think, have in many ways been 
harmful to certain elements of local and state economies, 
understanding what those impacts are and understanding, too, 
that our states are, in many areas, better situated to make 
decisions about species and conservation plans in their states. 
What works best, what their experience has been, I think, is 
where we need to be.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt;And with that, Mr. Bedke, I wanted to get your perspective. 
Several years ago the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service imposed 
certain overflight restrictions in the area of Mountain Home 
Air Force Base in the Little Jacks Creek area. And what 
happened with that, is it was in response to peregrine falcon 
nesting times.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt;And what it did was it cut off a large majority of the base 
air space to training in that particular region, cutting back 
on the opportunities for pilots to get the training they need 
to make sure that they are proficient. And, as you know, with 
pilots, especially in the Air Force and the Navy, if they don't 
have training as tactical pilots, then they lose their 
certifications and that creates an overall reduction in 
readiness for our Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt;And many of us served both on the Armed Services Committee 
and the Natural Resources Committee, so we see the crossover 
there, and those are concerns that many of us have in how these 
decisions impact our Nation's military readiness.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt;    Is there a possibility of additional overflight or use 
restrictions at Mountain Air Force Base by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service because of sage-grouse? And, if so, is that a 
continuing concern for Idaho and the impacts that that may 
have, both on the state and on our military readiness?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Congressman, I believe that it does. In some of
the earlier plans there were withdrawals and limitations on the 
use of the training areas, not only around Mountain Home, but 
also out in Tonopah in Nevada and other places. These are some 
of the best last places to go practice. Limiting that certainly 
inhibits our readiness as a Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;I think that you can have it both ways. However, this is 
not the first time that we have had training areas. And the 
sage-grouse has been able to get by.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;And that is maybe even understated. The sage-grouse 
population in Idaho is still hunted. In 9 of the 11 western 
states, these are still game birds, so it has nearly become a 
surrogate issue, about controlling the land management in these 
Federal lands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;I appreciate the position that has been expressed from 
Montana and other states, but with respect, Idaho's land 
management overlay is not like Montana's, nor is it like 
Wyoming's or Colorado's or any of the other states. Each state 
is unique, and the take-home message is that Mountain Home and 
the Air Force were at the table when we created the state plan. 
And we touched all of the bases with all of the stakeholders in 
there, again, gaining the blessing of the then-U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and BLM, and then new secretary, new rules, 
and new overlay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;We are not trying to circumvent, we want a good, viable 
bird population there. Again, coming back to the firefighting 
protocols, if both sides of the room agree that wildfire is the 
Number one threat, then we ought to be about changing the way 
we fight fires.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    It is foolish to have a fire boss come in from a fire in 
Arizona to a fire in Nevada. He has zero expertise with that 
area, and as he gets into cell phone range, we need to be able 
to e-mail him firefighting protocols where, when we didn't have 
the fire, we went in and we have a series of if-then 
statements. If the fire is here, you already have clearance to 
put a fire line there. And if the fire is in that quadrant, 
here is your permission to do what is needed. We are not 
talking about circumventing any of the historical values, or 
any of the cultural values, or any of the values out there at 
all. But during the fire is a bad time to try to get clearance 
for all of these things, and we can do a better job than we 
are.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you, I appreciate that&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, I appreciate that"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, I appreciate that"&gt;    Dr. Wittman. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, I appreciate that"&gt;    The Chairman. I wonder where I have heard those questions &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, I appreciate that"&gt;Dr. Wittman. Thank you.
before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, I appreciate that"&gt;    Dr. Wittman. I don't know.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, I appreciate that"&gt;    The Chairman. Too bad there is nobody here from Yakima to &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, I appreciate that"&gt;    Dr. Wittman. I don't know.
say what the bird did out there, too, right? For the Army.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to start with,
there was a new land management plan that came out and, 
obviously, that is why we are here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;    First, Mr. Tubbs, is this new land management plan 
affecting grazing, or is this about oil and gas drilling, or is 
this about home building? What real restrictions of those three 
categories are affected by the new land management plan?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt; Mr. Chairman, Congressman, one clarification.
Land management plan being the state's plan or the Federal 
plan?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt; The Federal plan. Forgive me.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;So, coming into it, Montana did raise concerns
about the resource management plans that were being developed 
by the Bureau of Reclamation. Montana's sage-grouse plan had 
yet to be authorized and implemented.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;We were concerned that there would be major impacts, absent 
a state conservation plan if only Federal lands were protected 
in Montana. Given the limited scope of sage-grouse habitat that 
they manage, we were basically being told that their only 
choice would be to lock down Federal lands without a sage-
grouse conservation plan for the state.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    We put that in place. Governor Bullock showed leadership in 
developing that plan, and we have maintained flexibility for 
our economy within sage-grouse habitat. We have reviewed 
thousands of proposals, rarely does a grazing plan require any 
permitting from a Montana perspective.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt; Sure. So, because I am particularly sensitive
about the grazing issue, it is not affecting grazing, per se, 
on Federal lands right now?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Well, Congressman and Mr. Chairman, most
recently our sage-grouse oversight team, with review of the 
Federal team, have authorized as accepted practices putting 
water lines for stock tanks so that we can spread out grazing 
and do better land management.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    Montana has a very strong culture of good conservation 
through our ranchers and farmers, and we think our plan 
protects that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt; I wanted to go back a little bit. There was, I
believe, in our last farm bill a sage-grouse initiative which 
created incentives for voluntary conservation. How did that 
initiative end up playing out?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Congressman, the sage-grouse
initiative in Montana is a key partnership with NRCS, our 
conservation districts, and the state. We have initially had 
three staff work with landowners across the state on a number 
of projects.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    The good news is that good sage-grouse conservation also is 
good range management. That helps good stock numbers and 
maintaining a healthy range. It also maintains the bird, as 
well as wildlife species. This area of Montana is also some of 
our top hunting in the United States, some of the biggest mule 
deer bucks or elk that you can get in any state will be found 
in sage-grouse habitat in Montana, and good range management 
preserves all those.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;Thank you. Speaker Bedke, first of all, I am
sorry about what happened to your land with the fire. That is 
terrible, what happened. And that perhaps is one of the things 
that we have to look at, either incorporating state or Federal 
amendments to look at fire prevention that makes sense. And 
also your suggestion about invasive species and how, either 
through state or Federal, we need to address that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;    Is the current land management plan preventing you from 
grazing on Federal land and lands that you own right now?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Well, Mr. Chairman and Congressman Soto, right
now, no. But next year, arguably, yes. What we have out there, 
we are blessed to have a lot of sage-grouse. So, therefore, you 
have a lot of leks, strutting grounds, or breeding grounds, and 
early in the spring the birds congregate on these leks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Then out around the leks there is a 5-mile buffer zone. And 
in that buffer zone, then, we are required to maintain minimal 
stubble height. The problem is that a cow, when she puts her 
head down to graze, she doesn't stop at 4 inches. And that 
becomes a problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    We want to have all of these objective goals, but we need 
to also have subjective goals. If a population is there, then 
that needs to be OK. So, our concern is that leaving that much 
stubble height contributes to the Number one cause of 
degradation, wildfire.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt; Thank you, and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt; Thompson.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Thompson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;Once again, thank you for being here and lending your 
expertise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;Mr. Tubbs, I have been impressed for the past couple years 
where we have had witnesses before us to talk about how top-
down, heavy-handed, punitive approaches to endangered species 
has just failed, and it has failed since the beginning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;But what has really impressed me is how, when we get to 
voluntary conservation and partnerships, when it is not 
punitive, how many species actually have been de-listed as a 
result of that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;    I know Montana has been one of the Nation's leaders in 
conserving and restoring the sage-grouse habitats, and I 
understand that Montana established a series of competitive 
grants that led to the restoration of thousands of acres of 
critical land. How effective have these grants been, and the 
spirit of voluntary conservation and other conservation 
partnerships been?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Congressman, Montana is blessed
with wonderful habitat, and much of that habitat is on private 
lands. As a result, land trusts have been working with 
landowners in Montana for decades in conservation practices. 
And, more recently, in conservation practices specifically at 
protecting the greater sage-grouse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;We have invested just over $3.5 million of state funds in 
sage-grouse conservation on several hundred thousand acres of 
ranch land in Montana, protecting it, and also stewarding those 
ranches into the future as working lands and working ranches.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;The effect is to preserve extremely high-quality habitat. 
That is where most of our money has been invested. We did 
invest in a couple of general habitat easements and are now 
trying those out in our new habitat conservation and mitigation 
plans as to how it can then bridge the gap where we need 
development.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    And development will happen in Montana. By providing this 
type of conservation investment with state dollars, we are able 
to maintain the economy, as well, where impacts to sage-grouse 
are not preventable.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Thompson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt; How many people have applied for these
grants? And will that trend continue to grow in the future? And 
what kind of leverage are you seeing on those investment 
dollars? What are the grant recipients bringing to the table? 
Any idea, in terms of matching dollars or voluntary dollars in 
this effort?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Congressman, we can provide you
with a full record of it, so that the Committee has the record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    We've had tremendous value, we are generally in it at a 1-
to-10 or 1-to-5 ratio, in those kind of parameters. Other 
conservation investors are the big land trusts. And it is the 
Montana Land Reliance, which is a big land trust made out of a 
small, little group of folks in Helena, Montana. But they have 
preserved over a million acres, so they celebrated that just 
this year. The Nature Conservancy is the other big land trust 
party that works in this landscape, and we have done deals with 
both. And then the private landowners and their families have 
been donators, as well.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Thompson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;Mr. Bird, we all know the devastating wildfire impact. We 
see that, unfortunately, all too real every day, especially 
right now. It is really highlighted, and we know it is 
continuous. And you mentioned wildfire is the sage-grouse's 
Number one threat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;    It seems that Utah has been somewhat successful in 
controlling wildfires, maybe better than some areas, through a 
state program. With a little bit of time, can you elaborate on 
the efforts taken between local, state, Federal, and private 
entities to do that with wildfires?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Congressman, I think the key to it
is getting money on the ground early, pre-suppression, and then 
post-suppression work in those areas. That is where Utah has 
done a great job. Our Legislature has done a wonderful job of 
getting money on the ground.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;    Before fire happens, and afterward, in fact, for every 
state dollar spent on restoration we have had $5 from partner 
agencies. And on pre-suppression work in the state, for every 
dollar we have had $20 from other partners, both local, 
private, and even individual landowners.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Thompson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Thompson"&gt;    Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt; Grijalva.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grijalva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Going back to that point that most of the
sage-grouse habitats in Montana are on private land, an ESA 
listing would have big implications. So, Montana initiated 
conserving habitats a long time ago.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;    A question on that, is energy development and other 
resource use easier or more difficult when sage-grouse 
populations are healthy, as we find the situation in Montana 
now, or when they are threatened by extinction?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, the situation in
Montana that we feared was without a Montana sage-grouse 
conservation plan, the Department of the Interior, through its 
Bureau of Land Management, was indicating that it would have to 
severely restrict development of any resources on Federal 
lands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    It also impacts our agricultural community, both on 
agricultural land, as well as grazing land, if only land use 
plans on the Federal side were there. By adopting a Montana 
conservation plan, we actually freed up the ability to develop 
energy resources, as well as other resources on Federal lands. 
And it is that partnership that we continue to strive to 
succeed at.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grijalva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt; So, a tremendous amount of outreach and state
involvement in the various plans, Director Tubbs, ultimately 
led to the 2015 decision not to list the sage-grouse. How has 
Montana been involved in the Secretary's recent decision to 
revisit and review those plans?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Congressman, Governor Bullock was
Chair of the Western Governors' Association when the 
Secretarial Order came out. Working with all 11 western 
governors, they created the Sage Grouse Advisory Group within 
the WGA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    Initially, there was good consultation early on with the 
Secretary's office. However, they rapidly pushed forward a 
product and defined which direction they were going to go, 
prior to re-engaging with the Governors' Association. And even 
though we continue to meet, we would ask that the 
Administration continue to work with our governors and the 
state of Montana, so that we can continue to improve the 
process.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grijalva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt; Just to follow up, changing the strategy at
this point on the conservation plans, would that threaten the 
bird?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, I think that it
is wholly dependent on what those changes would be. While one 
could argue that there is no increased risk to listing, that is 
significantly a question as to whether protections are taken 
away for any one state.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt;    That is part of the issue with the rangewide conditions 
determination. There are states like Montana that have good 
populations, great habitat. But we have been impacted and would 
be in the future if other states were allowed to change 
protections such that the species was warranted.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grijalva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Thank you, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;OK. Now, for ground rules here, a
couple of things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;First of all, this is in deference to Mr. Grijalva. Your 
microphone is on your left. It is the only thing that is going 
to be on the left in the room, but your microphone is on the 
left.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;    The Chairman. Second, for the witnesses, you don't have to &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;[Laughter.]
address me on every answer. When I ask my questions, they will 
be intelligent. You can address me then.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. So, you don't have to say ``Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="The Chairman. So, you don't have to say ``Mr"&gt; Chairman''
every time you open your mouth.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gosar&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Gosar"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Gosar"&gt;Dr. Gosar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Obama 
administration's de facto sage-grouse listing and the 20-year 
mineral moratorium on 10 million acres of land has been one of 
the greatest threats to the livelihood of western communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Gosar"&gt;Some of the most stifling consequences of the Obama-era 
regulations were targeted at businesses. New mining operations 
on this massive swath of land, where more than 7,000 active 
claims were already present, were prohibited for 2 years. 
Thankfully, President Trump's Department of the Interior 
canceled the massive proposed withdrawal, allowing job creators 
and hard rock miners to get back to work immediately.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Gosar"&gt;    Speaker Bedke, it is good to see you again. Given the 
litigation risks, the time it would take to once again amend 98 
management plans, and that the Forest Service has not even 
started to unwind their Obama plan amendments, do you agree 
with me that Congress must act and kill these 98 politically 
amended Obama plans, once and for all?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Yes, Congressman, I do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    Dr. Gosar. Would such actions provide the most certainty in 
the timeliest manner for the local stakeholders?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Yes, it certainly would, and here is the irony.
We are holding up the Obama administration rules as the 
standard by which all sage-grouse should be managed. And our 
state plans were compliant under that administration. They were 
blessed by that administration. And then, to guild the lily, if 
you will, at that point smacks of over-reach.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;We were on a good path. All we need is for everybody to 
roll it back to the way it was and let the state plans work. 
Montana's plan is going to look different than Idaho's. That is 
because the underlying topography is way different. Idaho is 
going to have similarities to Nevada's and Utah, but we have 
zero oil and gas. So, our mix is going to be different.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;And to have other states say that, if I may, I just heard 
that if Idaho changes its plan, or if the management is changed 
in Idaho, that that somehow threatens Montana. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. But I do take issue with the fact that 
Idaho is providing off-site mitigation for these other states. 
That is not right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;We have a plan. Hold us to a standard, give us the numbers, 
describe point B, and turn us loose, again, back to all the 
stakeholders that we had at the table. This was not a myopic 
group. It was broad-based. And we came up with a plan, a 
consensus plan, that was eventually endorsed by the then-Obama 
administration. These can work. Just give us the time, get out 
of our way and give us some time to let it work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;With all due respect, that is my point here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    Dr. Gosar. Well, my colleagues from the left, it defies 
everything they stand for--it is the all-encompassing, all-
knowing in Washington, DC, the bureaucracy. And, in Arizona, we 
actually had to fight the Fish and Wildlife Service. That was 
very belligerent. They were anti-law in regards to that, so it 
has been very cumbersome. So, I believe that I would trust the 
rancher back in Idaho or in Nevada versus the Federal 
Government.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;I would agree with you, Congressman, the
Nation's natural resources are best served by having local 
families acting as those stewards. The Nation's interests and 
these family interests coincide on being good, long-term 
stewards of the public lands in the West.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Dr. Gosar. I fully agree with you. My grandfather was a 
rancher. And if they cannot be conservationists, they don't 
have the luxury the following year. So, they are extremely in 
tune with the land and nature.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Dr. Goicoechea, it is good seeing you again. A couple of 
questions for you. At the risk of over-simplifying the issue, 
why would other state management plans not work for Nevada?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Dr. Goicoechea. Our threats, our topography are very 
different, Congressman. While Speaker Bedke says fire and 
invasives are the same in Idaho, we are the driest state in the 
Union, and no one knows that better than those of us that make 
a living off the land. We cannot apply prescriptions from 
Montana to Nevada. They will not work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    Dr. Gosar. Well, I am extremely grateful to Secretary Zinke 
and the acting BLM Director Nedd for their actions to unwind 
the bureaucratic mess of the previous administration, which was 
preventing effective state management of the sage-grouse 
recovery. And while taking steps to unwind the de factor sage-
grouse listing through the administrative action is welcome, 
Congress must act in order to provide timely and permanent 
certainty on this issue for local stakeholders in the western 
communities. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt; Labrador.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,
Speaker Bedke, for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt;I had the privilege of serving with Speaker Bedke for 4 
years in the Idaho Legislature, and it is always good to see 
him.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt;    Speaker, in 2011, when Secretary Salazar invited western 
states to partner with the Federal Government to work on 
solutions related to sage-grouse, how did the state of Idaho 
respond?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;We responded with enthusiasm. In the formal
conversations and the informal conversations that we had, we 
took this as an opportunity to help plan our own destiny. For 
once, it looked like the locals would be empowered to solve a 
broad-based problem. It was what we have been talking about for 
decades. And we went into it with good faith. We had a lot of 
meetings, a lot of discussions. Again, this was not a 
homogenous group. And we had a good work product come out of 
that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    So, you can only imagine our disappointment when the goal 
line was moved, and the rules changed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt; Absolutely. What role did the Federal
agencies in Idaho play during that process?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;They were in the room. We had all of them in the
room. And it is not like they got pre-decisional, but they 
certainly were able to communicate kind of a warmer, warmer, 
colder, colder type of an approach as we noodled and 
contemplated and had discussions on what the plan might look 
like.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    And we had Jack Connelly, you know, he wrote the sage-
grouse bible. He was in the room the whole time. And our plan 
reflected what was good for the bird at every turn.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt; Did these agencies approve of the plan?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Certainly, yes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service ultimately blessed the plan. I don't think that is the 
proper terminology, but endorsed it, and it became the co-
preferred alternative, with the BLM, under the NEPA process.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt; You have mentioned that the main threat to
sage-grouse in Idaho is fires. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Yes. Not just I, but that is what the science
says.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt; Correct. Do the Obama administration plans
address these threats?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Well, the old plan did, because baked into the
Idaho plan were robust, firefighting measures, some of the 
things that I have talked about here, having if-then 
statements. You know, if the fire starts here, then it is OK to 
put a fire line there, and getting all the clearances ahead of 
time so that you have an algorithm, basically--if the fire is 
in this section, then it is OK to do this other list of things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    So, fire was integral, and its control was in the middle of 
all these plans.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt; What could be done to make firefighting more
effective to better protect sage habitat?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Thank you. I have alluded to that at the time.
The firefighters know how to put out fires. We hamstring them, 
and tie their hands with Federal regulatory overlay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;They are as frustrated, that day that we went from 500 
acres to 20,000 acres was a frustrating day for the guys on the 
fire line, it was a frustrating day for the ranchers, whose 
livelihood and the ability to feed their livestock was going up 
in smoke. And to have the heavy equipment sit on a truck 
because there was no Cat tender there, someone to walk in front 
of it as they put the line in, by an existing road that had 
already been disturbed by existing fence lines that had already 
been disturbed, was counterproductive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    By anyone's standard, they ought to be able to make on-the-
ground decisions. If we are going to tie their hands on the 
ground, then let's give them an algorithm ahead of time that 
they can have in their file, so that they can say it started in 
this quadrant, so therefore I can do these things. And we have 
touched all the archeological, historical, cultural, other 
species concerns ahead of time when you are not under the gun 
of having a fire.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt; And it is not just frustrating, but it is
more dangerous for the firefighters, too, is it not?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Well, certainly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt; Yes. Are you aware of the notice of intent
that was recently released by the Department of the Interior?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt; Can the existing plans that affect Idaho be
fixed, or do they need to be completely repealed and replaced 
with a state plan?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; I think that we need to be able to roll back the
Federal plan amendments to go back to the state's plan, so that 
each state has a plan that works in their locality. I applaud 
these other states, they should applaud us, and we should go 
back to the state plans.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Labrador&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Labrador"&gt; Thank you, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"&gt; Tipton.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tipton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the panel for
taking the time to be able to be here today, as well. It is 
interesting, being able to hear the stories from the different 
states, from Nevada to Montana to Idaho and into Utah, as well, 
in terms of being able to come up with plans that actually work 
for our individual states.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;I come out of the state of Colorado. We have very unique 
topography in the state of Colorado. One of our local counties 
had invested several million dollars in actually mapping out 
the best areas for sage-grouse rehabilitation for the actual 
habitat that would work. That was completely in contradiction 
of what the BLM had originally put out with a broad-brush 
stroke, to where the entire western half of Colorado was 
virtually sage-grouse habitat, even though it could not sustain 
it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;So, those private-public partnerships, which were developed 
with the local ranchers, with the local counties, with our 
state, were actually yielding what we wanted to be able to 
achieve.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;I certainly applaud the efforts that we are seeing in our 
state and I listen to the conversation. It seems that the 
debate is not so much about species rehabilitation as about 
should the Federal Government make the determination, or should 
the states be able to implement some of those policies. And I 
think a sensible person would certainly step forward and say if 
we want to be able to achieve the goal, let's follow the best 
route.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;Mr. Goicoechea, when you were talking about the fire that 
broke out in your state, you had the ranchers apply to be able 
to actually get in to graze, to be able to create better 
habitat, because you had good moisture growing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;What was the policy of the Federal Government, and how did 
that impact, ultimately, the habitat of rehabilitating the 
species?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;Dr. Goicoechea. Thank you. So, Mr. Congressman, when you 
are 87 percent controlled by the Federal Government, you find 
yourself a lot of times asking Father or Mother May I, and that 
is what happened in this case. There was not the flexibility to 
go beyond the term permit, even though the range conditions 
showed we have a high fire risk here. In no way, shape, or form 
was there going to be resource damage by allowing those 
livestock to stay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;    The Bureau of Land Management is afraid of litigation. They 
have been litigated time and time again. They do not want to 
step outside. They don't have the flexibility, and these plans 
are not giving them that flexibility. So, when they said no, 
the cattle moved on, and 30 days later we had 220,000 acres of 
black.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tipton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;I am a small business guy, and in terms of
having the flexibility, that was one of the issues that we 
actually had in Colorado. Unfortunately, when they were 
revisiting the plan, some efforts were made in the original 
efforts to be able to incorporate some of the Colorado ideas. 
But they were discarded for consistency of a one-size-fits-all 
program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;When we are talking about science and the best 
understanding of it, each one of you in your states, you have 
game and fish departments that are there, you have local county 
officials that are there. Would you say they are pretty good 
experts, in terms of probably knowing the habitat, knowing how 
to best be able to address an issue?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;Mr. Goicoechea?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;Dr. Goicoechea. Yes, sir, absolutely. And when it comes to 
firefighting, as well, your state and local departments, those 
volunteers in Nevada, the Nevada Division of Forestry, we know 
the best. We know the conditions on the ground, we know where 
to make that stand. We know who has grazed, how long they have 
grazed, when they have grazed, where the natural breaks are.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt;    If we don't empower the locals and the state agencies, we 
will never get ahead of habitat loss.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tipton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt; Director Bird, Speaker Bedke, would you speak
to that, as well?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt; I would agree, we do a good job of managing
wildlife in the states. That is what we do with our wildlife 
agencies. I wish you could come and see some of our local 
meetings with the local landowners, the agencies, the 
sportsmen, and all those folks who are involved working 
together to come up with priorities for projects in their area. 
It is an amazing thing to watch.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Congressman, many of us have been in these types
of meetings before, and we did not want to go through the 
frustration and disappointment of having the wrong people in 
the room at the start. So, we went out of our way at the 
beginning of the process to make sure we had the right people 
in the room, the right scientists.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    Again, I referenced earlier Mr. Connelly is the standard. 
He wrote the sage-grouse guidebook. He was in the room with us. 
We, again, did not want to have happen, what has ultimately 
happened, that we would look back at our process and say it was 
deficient in some way, and therefore we have to start over. We 
went to great lengths to have the right people in the room all 
the time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tipton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Tipton"&gt; My time has expired, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;    Mr. Pearce, are you ready? OK. The one on your left.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt;It is hard for me to reach the left, sir. I
will take your orders, if you make me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt;Mr. Tubbs, you seem to be in a position where you would 
work with the Fish and Wildlife Service, you kind of know the 
way they operate, the way they think. And that is not a trick 
question, I was just trying to get everybody on the ground 
here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt; Congressman, we certainly have been working with
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Montana for decades.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; I know, but when I look at the estimates of
numbers of birds, the estimates are 200 to 500,000. That is 
kind of a big gap. Behind the scenes, do they ever sit there 
and say, ``Can't we get this a little bit closer?''
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt; Mr. Chairman, sorry about that, Congressman----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; Don't put any thoughts in my head.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt; It is a fact of my Montana State Legislature,
Congressman. In Montana, our fish and wildlife agency is the 
agency that is required to report populations. While we know 
lek counts, actually counting birds is a statistical exercise, 
and not an easy thing to do. So, I think that probably 
results----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; Do you think that is an acceptable gap?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt; Congressman, we are putting additional efforts,
in fact, our State Legislature has directed our wildlife agency 
to report population estimates into developing those, so we 
hope to have better statistics in the future.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tubbs&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Tubbs"&gt; It will remain a statistical question, though.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; Mr. Bedke, you are the one that experienced the
fire, right, on your property?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Yes, this year. But fire is part of the
ecosystem in the Great Basin, and we experience fires in some 
sort, either I do or my neighbors or my extended family, each 
and every year.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; It is part of the ecosystem, but the ecosystem
used to be in balance. Is the ecosystem in balance today?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;I believe that it is not, Congressman. If you go
back to the days where there were huge sage-grouse numbers, 
they were also arguably some of the bad old days of grazing. It 
was a continuous graze situation. There were not any rotational 
systems like we employ now and have for the last 40 years, 30 
years, for sure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    Back in those days, that is when the bird flourished. And 
the reason is because you turned the cattle out in the spring, 
and they found their own level, so to speak, over the entire 
allotment. And as they did that, they created natural fire 
breaks because they camped out in the bottoms where the streams 
are. If you are out where there are 10 inches of rain per year, 
or 12, then that is where the cattle go, and they eat the more 
desirable plants in the bogs, and then work up the side hills.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; Yes, I appreciate that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; So, that created natural fire breaks that, in a
deferred or a rotational system, you do not have now.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt;I understand. In New Mexico, I know that we
experienced that. The ecosystem used to have a major fire every 
8 years. The tree rings would show that. And when we quit 
putting out fires, then we logged to make the difference. Then, 
when we quit logging, instead of 50 trees per acre, we have 500 
or 2,500 trees per acre. The system is out of balance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt;Then the Forest Service says we are going to reintroduce 
fire into the wild, kind of like we just discovered this thing 
here, and it is the way it ought to be. Now we are getting the 
3,000-acre fires. We are seeing what is going on in California. 
And the system is badly out of balance, and fire is 
destructive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt;    Did you ever hear the Fish and Wildlife Service complaining 
about the fires and the destruction of habitat and endangered 
species, especially the sage-grouse? Do you ever hear that? Did 
you hear it when you experienced that major fire?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; We certainly did. And those discussions and
those 18 months of meetings is where I learned that the Number 
one threat to sage-grouse was fire.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; Yes, but what do they do? The Fish and Wildlife
will stop every activity, but they do not stop the Forest 
Service from mismanaging our forests.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Congressman, we must conclude that it is not
about the bird, and it is more about land management.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; Mr. Bird, you are spending a lot of money in
Utah on trying to stop the problem. What do you all do for 
active management? You just fight fires? What do you do with 
your money?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt; No, again, it is active, hands-on management. It
is pre-suppression, it is getting rid of pinyon-juniper, it is 
getting rid of the threats and the problems.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; Does the Forest Service help you in those
efforts?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt; They have in this area. The Forest Service and
BLM have.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Pearce"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. All right&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="The Chairman. All right"&gt; Speaking of wildfires, Mr. LaMalfa
from California, the Burn State.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LaMalfa&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this
panel. Again, thank you for your time and travel, being here, 
and for the level of patience you have with trying to deal with 
this issue. I do have several of these counties in my area, 
whether it is burning forest, burning sage habitat, or what 
have you, that continues to be a problem with little solution 
coming out of Washington. I am more hopeful here in the last 
few months.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;But what I want to hear from the panel here is, how do you 
feel lately, especially that the engagement with the Federal 
Government has been with the state, local level, tribal 
officials on getting to a better solution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;Again, my area on the California side has Modoc County, 
Lassen County, Plumas County, a neighbor to Mr. Amodei, over 
there on the Nevada side, where he is working very hard, doing 
great work on that, as well, over there, with that common 
backyard.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;The gentleman, Mr. Bird, you were talking a little bit 
earlier about when you get people in the room it was a really 
good, positive meeting, and also Speaker Bedke, as well, when 
you get the right people in the room, the collaboration has 
been pretty good. Do you feel lately, both of you, that the 
Federal collaboration side of that has been helpful? Do you 
feel the ball is being moved?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;    Somebody said on this panel also that there is the fear of 
litigation. Just touch on those two things, Mr. Bird, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt; I would think it works best, obviously, at the
local level. We get along well with our local managers, and 
when they are given the flexibility to work with us, that works 
well. That would be my statement there, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;You will always be surprised if you have a
common goal. Then, there are ground rules that are set up that 
no one's position in the room is going to trump the other 
positions, and you are going to stay until you are finished, 
you are going to stay until you have a solution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    It takes you a few meetings to get into that mode, frankly. 
But once you do, then it turns out you have the expertise, good 
ideas, and the good thinking that happens in a group dynamic. 
Then, you have a good product. And that is what we experienced, 
and that is why we are so indignant that they changed it on us 
after all that good work.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LaMalfa&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt; They changed it? Which ``they''?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; They, the Federal Government. They amended our
amendments. Over the top of these state plans, they went to the 
next level that made it impossible, or certainly would make it 
very difficult, to continue things like livestock grazing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LaMalfa&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt; When you show them the results about the
number of acres of sage-grouse habitat that is being burned and 
lost and the negative results you are seeing, does this shake 
them up any? What do they say when you have these meetings with 
them?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Well, it depends on how formal a meeting it is.
No one likes to see the habitat burn.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LaMalfa&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt; I wonder. I wonder. Do they like it because of
the preventative measures, whether they are talking sage 
habitat or forestry, as well, they don't seem to really allow 
effective measures to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Any decent land manager knows that the growth
increment every year will build up, and it does not matter 
whether you are in a forest situation, or a range situation. 
That growth increment is going to be there every year, and you 
can either harvest it or you can eventually burn it. Those are 
your two choices.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LaMalfa&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;Mr. Goicoechea, again, when we see that the
environmental groups really spend most of their time suing the 
Forest Service or BLM when these efforts are being made, don't 
you feel they are essentially preventing the ability of the 
sage-grouse to actually thrive and be populous in the area at 
the end of the day?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Absolutely. They are preventing the 
flexibility and adaptive management that we need to allow the 
bird to flourish.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LaMalfa&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;And we have heard even in this Committee today
that grazing is not the answer, that grazing somehow is making 
it worse. Please address that, as my time expires here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Grazing is a huge tool, and the most 
readily available tool to limiting the size of our fires. In 
the Great Basin, that is the Number one threat. You have heard 
it over and over again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LaMalfa&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;What does it cost the government to have
grazing? I would just like to hear that number.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. It benefits the government. It makes the 
government money.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LaMalfa&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;The government makes money. Yes, all right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"&gt;    Thank you, panelists, I appreciate it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Good answer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="The Chairman. Good answer"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="The Chairman. Good answer"&gt;    Mr. Graves, who asked me my favorite sage-grouse recipe. 
You can maybe ask them, as well.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the
opportunity to be here. And I want to thank all of you for the 
travel today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Mr. Bird, I am from Louisiana and I am a little slow, I 
guess, right? I just want to make sure I understand this 
clearly. This is an issue where the Federal Government is 
mismanaging a species and you are asking for more state control 
of that. Is that accurate?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt; I think, Congressman, any time we have more local
control it works better.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; I am sorry. You said any time you have more
state control it works better?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt; More local/state control, it works better.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; Wow. How about that? Thank you very, very much.
I cannot even tell you how much I appreciate that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    The Chairman. I am assuming that applies to fish, as well &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; Wow. How about that? Thank you very, very much.
I cannot even tell you how much I appreciate that.
as birds?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; Oh, wow, look at that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. OK&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="The Chairman. OK"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;How about that?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;I didn't think you would draw that connection.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Speaker Bedke, you are a fifth-generation rancher, as I 
understand. You have people from Washington, DC, that are 
making decisions in your state. Can you talk a little bit about 
what you see as being a disconnect between some of the 
decisions that are being made, versus practical application on 
the ground in your state?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    And what I mean by that is, if you are truly trying to 
advance an objective, whether it is an environmental objective, 
a land management objective, or others, could you talk a little 
bit about how you see a disconnect, or perhaps a 
misunderstanding of practical solutions trying to address some 
of these objectives?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;The reason that I include that, I am the fourth
generation, and I am in Washington, DC, and the fifth 
generation is doing all the work while I am here. So, the 
reason that we even mention that in our bios is because we are 
proud of that, and we have a legacy and an experience over 
decades, generations of stewardship.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;In my tenure at the ranch, with every new administration we 
make 90-degree turns to the previous policy. That is 
disruptive, over time, to good ecosystem management. Livestock 
has grazed out in this part of the world since the 1860s. So, 
the fact that we are there, and the bird has flourished up to 
this time ought to tell us something. And we can continue to do 
that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    But the disconnect is that no never means no, yes never 
means yes. We are just waiting for the shift in the political 
winds, and that is ultimately bad land management.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Let's see, I have one more question. I just
want to make sure, actually, maybe I will ask Mr. Bird, because 
I am not sure I can pronounce the other name.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; Can you talk a little bit, and just give your
perspective. I heard you all talk about this when I came in, 
but you are talking about multiple states, and the ability of 
states to work together toward a common solution, whenever 
states in some cases may have different objectives. Can you 
talk about perhaps an experience that you have had in working 
together with other states and the ability of states to work 
together toward a common objective like this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;Well, like you say, Congressman, all states are
different. We all have different objectives, different needs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;    I think one example in Utah is that we don't have the same 
percentage and the issues with the oil and gas industry and 
sage-grouse that Wyoming would, or other states. And I think 
working through those differences and/or working through our 
similarities is always helpful.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; Would any of the rest of you care to comment on
that, just on experiences?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;I will jump in. The sage-grouse working group is
a product of the state legislators getting together. We have a 
common issue, we learned this from the wolf de-listing. So, 
Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming came together to coordinate our 
efforts, to coordinate our state plans so, ultimately, the wolf 
could be de-listed. And we were successful doing that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    Now the next issue that comes along is the sage-grouse 
issue. We keep that same coordination between the existing 
three states. We add Utah, Nevada, Colorado, and eastern 
Oregon. Those state legislators come. We met regularly in Salt 
Lake City, and we formulated these plans, knowing full well 
that there had to be coordination between the state plans, 
ultimately.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt;The principal question I have is whether
our laws are actually counterproductive to protecting 
endangered species. For example, our experience in the Sierra 
is we now have Draconian restrictions over land management, 
catastrophically overgrown forests.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt;Those forests are now susceptible to natural stressors such 
as drought, pestilence, disease, and ultimately catastrophic 
wildfire. We have lost 1,100 square miles of forestland in my 
district to catastrophic fire in the last 5 years, and a lot of 
that has incinerated protected wildlife habitats. In fact, I 
think two fires cost us about 80 spotted owl habitats that we 
lost because we could not manage the land because of laws that 
were purportedly protecting the spotted owl. Now those habitats 
are gone completely.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt;    Is that the same story for the sage-grouse and other 
management restrictions?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Sir, to a degree, it is. A range fire is a lot
different than a forest fire. It is not as hot, and things grow 
back quicker under a range situation, if you can ever get any 
rain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    But in the forest, it is certainly a much bigger deal. You 
have to thin the growth increment in a forest. And if you 
don't, then, like I said earlier, either man will harvest it or 
nature will harvest it. And when man has pre-empted nature as 
long as it has in a forest situation, then the fires are 
catastrophic, and they are sterilizing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt; But in the case of range land, you
mentioned the fact that forest firefighting efforts were 
delayed catastrophically for lack of, what did you call it, a 
Cat spotter?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Cat tender.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt; Cat tender.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Yes, and it has nothing to do with felines, and
everything to do with the machine that is built in Peoria, 
Illinois.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt; But, basically, in the middle of a wildfire
emergency, where they are trying to cut a fire break, they were 
delayed because there wasn't an expert who could precede the 
bulldozer to determine whether or not there might be 
archeological finds or, I assume also, sage-grouse nests in 
front of the bulldozer as the fire was bearing down on it? Do I 
understand that correctly?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; You understand it perfectly. It is as if we had
a fire in this room, and fire extinguishers hanging on that 
wall, and you couldn't use them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt;When I was at the Detwiler Fire, which
caused the evacuation of Mariposa and threatened the Yosemite 
Valley just a couple of months ago, the firefighters were 
complaining to me that they had been trying for years to get 
permits for controlled burns so that they could have defensible 
space between the dying forests and the range land, which they 
rightly calculated was in immediate danger of igniting. And it 
did. And they couldn't get permits for it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt;    And then fire comes through, and the amount of carbon being 
released by these fires makes a mockery of all of our 
environmental laws.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Again, if you want to argue with me,
Congressman, you are going to have to change the subject.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Because that is exactly the point. All of these
preventative measures that you reference have to go through 
NEPA. And our NEPA process is set up so that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt; It is needlessly time-consuming and
ultimately cost-prohibitive.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; It is time consuming and prone to lawsuits. So,
you have this paralysis by this wanting to love the ground 
through NEPA.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt; Let me change the subject for a moment.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; All right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt; Nobody wants to see any species go extinct.
But I don't understand why captive breeding programs and fish 
hatchery programs shouldn't be employed to maintain these 
populations.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; That is exactly the mentality that I took in the
room, as well. I have learned since that it is hard to do 
captive breeding programs with the sage-grouse. It works very 
well with other species, but for some reason----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt; But in many cases they still don't let us
include them in the population counts.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; That is the case, certainly, with fish.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McClintock&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt;OK. One more, oh yes, on climate change. It
seems to me that the climate has been changing for about 4\1/2\ 
billion years. The planet has been warming on and off since the 
last Ice Age.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. McClintock"&gt;    But it is changing, it is warming. Doesn't that argue in 
favor of more active management of our lands, so that we can 
match the density of the vegetation to the ability of the land 
to support it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; And in unison, the choir said yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Cheney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Cheney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you to all of our witnesses for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;Speaker Bedke, I was particularly struck by your testimony 
and by your description of what had happened most recently on 
your land. And you had a line in your written testimony where 
you noted that good intentions are not good enough. I think 
that is a very apt description for what has happened here. And 
I think it is a diplomatic description, frankly, for what has 
happened here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;But when you look at the policies that we have seen, 
particularly out of the last 8 years, and the attempt to impose 
this one-size-fits-all, Wyoming has 37 percent of the sage-
grouse population, and we are very proud of our state 
management plan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;    I wonder, though, if you could describe in a little bit 
more detail what happened when you saw these amendments 
imposed, and specifically, what were the brakes that you saw 
put on the state management plan that had been so carefully 
developed and put into place in Idaho?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Well, they went beyond the mark. And we knew we
had to defend these plans, long term, and made them as bullet-
proof as we possibly could, and still allow for the traditional 
uses out there. Everyone at the table, including the ranchers, 
knew that their practices were going to have to be modified, 
and they were in agreement to do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;All right, so then you have the plan amendments that 
overlay over the top. Like I described, the lek buffers. If you 
have a lot of leks, you have a lot of 5-mile circumference, or 
5-mile circles around each one of these leks, where their use 
at certain times of the year are severely limited. And to 
conduct a grazing program in these polka dots, over, literally, 
tens of thousands of acres, you cannot fence them economically 
to keep the cattle out.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;So, it becomes very, very subjective, based on, again, the 
political winds that are blowing. And that was our largest 
concern.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Then these wholesale mineral withdrawals, the tens of 
millions of acres that were lifted and all the headlines read 
that Zinke is removing the protection for the sage-grouse. 
Well, that was never a problem in the first place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;I look to everything through the lens of a livestock 
person, and not a miner or the others, or a mineral or gas 
explorer. So, specifically for the livestock were the buffer 
zones and the stubble height requirements. After you graze, you 
still had to have 7 inches of stubble height after you go in 
there, and that is hard to accomplish.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    And it becomes a judgment call each and every day out there 
by the land management agencies whether or not you are in 
compliance. And if you are not, then baked into their protocols 
was this 50 percent reduction, and a 50 percent reduction, and 
a 50 percent reduction. Well, you can only stand so many of 
those, and then you are out of business.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Cheney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;Thank you. And in addition to the damage that
has been done to the grazing industry, for example, and I 
apologize if I don't get your name right, Mr.--J.J.? J.J., you 
can call me Liz.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;In addition to the damage that has been done to some of our 
industries, the grazing industry and the mineral industry, 
isn't it true that when we are trying to impose a one-size-
fits-all solution to Washington we are also not as effective as 
we could be in helping to preserve the sage-grouse?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;Dr. Goicoechea. Congresswoman Liz, that is exactly correct. 
And that is why we have to get away from it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;And what Speaker Bedke is alluding to as he talks about the 
grazing and the 7 inches are the habitat objectives in that 
table. They may work well in parts of Wyoming, they may work 
well in parts of Montana. There are hardly any places in Nevada 
where they are going to work well. Seven inches? If we had 7 
inches of grass and could grow it regularly, we would not be 
sitting in here, having this conversation today. And that is 
part of the problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt;    We have to get back to that local, we are damaging the 
bird, we are burning the habitat by trying to achieve something 
that ecologically is impossible to do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Cheney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Ms. Cheney"&gt; Thank you very much. And I think it is a sad
and tragic example, but a really important example of, across 
the board, what happens when you have mismanagement from 
Washington, and I am fully supportive and very proud to be a 
co-sponsor of the Chairman's legislation. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt; And I appreciate Representative
Cheney for covering for me on the Floor the other night, too. 
Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gianforte&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gianforte&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt;Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you
to the panel for being here. And it is great to hear the 
successes you are having.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt;I want to call out Director Tubbs first, for the phenomenal 
work that has been done in Montana, and you have led that 
effort. We have been able to protect the great sage-grouse in 
Montana. I understand that our male sage-grouse population is 
up 153 percent since 2014, largely thanks to the all lands/all 
hands approach that you have spearheaded.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt;I can attest myself last week being in southern Phillips 
County, trying to fill an antelope tag, that there were many 
sage-grouse that we witnessed in the pastures, so that was 
good. Keep up the good work. I appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt;My first question is for Speaker Bedke. I want to dig in a 
little more. You testified that rangewide plans lack the 
recognition of the issues that are facing the species in a 
specific state. And some states are happier with these rules 
than others, because of the differences we have talked about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt;You have also noted a disregard for science in some of 
these plans. I want to go specifically to wildfires, because 
you listed that as the primary issue in affecting habitat, and 
we talked at some length here about the specific regulations 
that are impeding local firefighting. You mentioned a couple.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt;    My question is, what additionally should we be doing to 
free up and provide more local control, as we attempt to fight 
fire and protect sage-grouse habitat?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Well, I envision a world where an edict comes
from Washington, for a change, out to the local offices that 
says, ``You will have pre-fire suppression plans so that we can 
accomplish some of the,'' and that is not going to eliminate 
all the fires out there. Every front that comes through is 
going to have lightning with it, and there are going to be 
fires started, but we can minimize the size of these fires.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    Because if it is an all-hands-on-deck for the sage-grouse, 
and the Number one issue or the Number one threat is fire, then 
we can do better here. Yet, our actions out on the ground 
contradict that statement. I can only describe my frustration 
watching that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gianforte&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt; And we have heard testimony here that we are
better off----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Yes, but what we need to do, then, is create
fire districts out there, so that the ranchers are trained and 
have access to equipment. Because they live out there, and many 
times they will be the ones to see the smoke, and they can go 
out and address that, so they need to be properly trained and 
their communication systems need to be able to talk to the 
Federal land management agencies. We have started doing that 
with great success in some parts of the state.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gianforte&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt; OK. Mr. Bird, you testified that you have
actually cut the wildfire impact on sage-grouse by 50 percent, 
protecting over 500,000 acres. Can you just go into a little 
more detail on how you did that, and what should we do at the 
Federal level to encourage that behavior or get out of the way?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;Every acre of pre-suppression saves a ton of
money in the end. And we know, as states, as local entities, 
where our greatest threats are. And the key is working those 
areas. Whether it is sage-grouse habitat or whether it is near 
communities, we know where those threats are. And it is a 
matter of getting ahead of ourselves and doing that pre-
suppression work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;    Oftentimes, as we know, when the fire season goes on and 
Federal money gets fewer and further between, the Forest 
Service, for instance, will go over budget on their fire. And 
what goes first? That pre-suppression money that could have 
been on the ground and could have prevented those fires in the 
first place.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gianforte&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt; So, reducing fuel loads, doing preparation
actually reduces the intensity and the severity of the fires?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;Right. And just following up on Speaker Bedke, we
have a new program in Utah called the catastrophic fire 
program, and that is getting into those local fire districts, 
getting into those local areas, training them so that they can 
take care of those fires immediately.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;    In fact, I think it is closer to 90 percent of the initial 
fire attack in Utah is done by those local volunteer agencies. 
And if they are properly trained, they can do a remarkable job.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gianforte&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt;Again, I want to thank the panel here for
your testimony today. It is clear that when there is more local 
control, we get better outcomes for the sage-grouse and for our 
local producers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Gianforte"&gt;    And, with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your
indulgence in letting anybody show up at this meeting. I 
appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Mr. Goicoechea, for those of you who have a hard time 
pronouncing his name, the only reason I know is because I spent 
14 years in the Nevada Legislature with his father. They are 
Spanish Basque, I believe. So, for those of you that are into 
kind of that what side of the ridge line those sheep herders 
are from, the French Basque will not be happy to know that Dr. 
Goicoechea, who is a large-animal vet, is from the wrong side 
of the ridge line.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;That notwithstanding, though, I go into that embarrassing 
part for both of us to underscore the fact that as I look at 
this distinguished panel with the Speaker from Idaho, the 
Deputy Director from Utah's Natural Resources Department, and 
the Director from Montana, what we have sitting over there in 
the nice Basque gentleman's chair is the guy who is the head of 
the Nevada Sagebrush Ecosystem Council, which was the policy 
group formed by the legislature. The bill was signed by the 
Governor to do numerous things, if you look at the statute, but 
it is basically to establish what the facts are and what the 
policy ought to be, and create a sagebrush conservation plan 
for the state of Nevada. Thank you for your service, Dr. 
Goicoechea.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;So, when we talk about collaboration and transparency, I 
want to start out with a few questions that are pretty easy 
ones to answer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Have you completed a Nevada plan for the conservation of 
the sage-grouse and its habitat?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Does that plan contain a provision dealing with
wild horses?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Did the plan that was put into the BLM resource
management plans and travel management plans in Nevada contain 
an element that dealt with wild horses?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Not efficiently at all, no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Thank you. Now, let me ask you this. Did your
plan have a mitigation system in it?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Yes, sir, the Nevada conservation credit 
system.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Did the one that was enacted in the six or
seven Nevada district offices, their resource management and 
travel management plans, did it include a mitigation system in 
it?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. No, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Can you tell me any part of the Nevada plan
that was adopted after the draft EIS was circulated in Nevada 
and the final one came out? Was there any part of the Nevada 
plan that was picked up in that transparent collaborative 
process?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. No, sir, I can't tell you of one.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;So, when we hear about transparency, let's go
to another area, sagebrush focal areas. About 3 million acres 
in Nevada, is that correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Yes, sir. A little over.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Did your group--by the way, your group worked
for how long on this plan?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Several, a couple of years.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Public hearings?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Public hearings, hundreds of hours of 
hearings and public testimony.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Noticed in accordance with the open meeting
law?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Your members included environmentalists, they
included members of the public, they included members of the 
State Wildlife Commission, ex officio were all the Federal land 
managers in the state. Is that accurate?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. That is accurate.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;When did you find out that Nevada was to have 3
million acres of something called a sagebrush focal area?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. When the record of decision was signed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;And that was not in the draft EIS?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. No, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;I would like to add for the Committee's record
that in my service on an inferior committee, when we had the 
Director of the Bureau of Land Management, the Chief of the 
Forest Service, we asked the question, ``Where did the 
sagebrush focal areas come from?''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;I would further represent for the Committee's record that 
the answer from those gentlemen basically said it came from 
fish.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;So, when then-Director of Fish and Wildlife, Mr. Ashe, was 
there, we said, ``How did you figure out where the lines 
were?'' Well, that was an open, collaborative process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;It was such a good, open, and collaborative process that if 
you look in your Committee brief you will see that a Federal 
district court judge, who probably does not show up as a 
contributor to the present Administration's campaign fund, 
ruled that they had not complied with NEPA and that these came 
out of nothing that would resemble, these are my words, no one 
else's, an open and collaborative process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;So, as you can tell, I want to thank you for those answers. 
I want to also do a couple other things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;One is it is my understanding that, of the $65 million that 
the people in the 114th Congress appropriated to the Department 
of the Interior to take care of sagebrush things on the ground, 
that $35 million of it stayed within the Beltway. So, when we 
talk about fuels management and other sorts of collaborative 
things, that is not a great record of putting things in the 
Beltway.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Are we thinking maybe things closer to the state are 
better, perhaps?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Now the last thing I want to go through, real quickly, 
because I am almost out of time. Mr. Chairman, it is my 
understanding that, in the last 20 years, BLM statistics, not 
counting the last fire season, there were between 6 and 7 
million acres burned in Nevada, that sheep grazing is about 20 
percent of what it used to be, that Federal land managers have 
basically permitted 150,000 acres in mining, and that cattle 
grazing is down about 20 percent from its height. Are those 
numbers basically accurate?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Those are basically accurate. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;So, based on those numbers, when you talk about
the Number one threat to habitat, whether it is fragmentation 
or loss, would it be your conclusion that when we talk about 
mining and grazing and things like that, and the decisions of 
Federal land managers, that those are not the threats?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. Yes, sir. The threats are----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Amodei&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;Thank you. And thank you Mr. Chairman, and God
bless the West.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Amodei"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. I don't want the gavel to come flying at 
me.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Yes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="The Chairman. Yes"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="The Chairman. Yes"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="The Chairman. Yes"&gt;    The Chairman. And after that you can carry your laundry on &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="The Chairman. Yes"&gt;[Laughter.]
the streets if you want to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="The Chairman. Yes"&gt;Let me just take a couple seconds to ask a few questions 
here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="The Chairman. Yes"&gt;Mr. Goicoechea, first of all, there have been three reviews 
of sage-grouse by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Each time they 
have said that they did not warrant listing. There is another 
one scheduled in 2020. Based on your experience in past times, 
do you expect them to find something different in this fourth 
review that they have not found in the other three?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="The Chairman. Yes"&gt;    Dr. Goicoechea. No, sir, I do not. And I believe that it is 
critical that we continue to collect that data that shows what 
we are doing in our states is effective and is protecting those 
birds.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. OK, Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="The Chairman. OK, Mr"&gt;Bird, the state of Utah spent roughly
$3 million in the management of habitat and things like the 
watershed protection initiative, and everything else.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="The Chairman. OK, Mr"&gt;    What is the difference between the population, say, in the 
last 30 years of the bird in the state of Utah?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt; Up, they are up.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt;    The Chairman. Significantly?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt; Up, they are up.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bird&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Bird"&gt; They are up.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. They are up&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="The Chairman. They are up"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="The Chairman. They are up"&gt;    Same thing, Mr. Speaker. You put, like, $750 million in 
sage-grouse management in Idaho?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; I think that is a cumulative number from all the
western states.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    The Chairman. As I think some of the others have been &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; I think that is a cumulative number from all the
western states.
saying here, have the requirements that have been put on you 
most recently from the Federal Government, the BLM, as well as 
the Forest Service, have they augmented those situations, what 
you are trying to do, or has it been basically a hindrance to 
what you are attempting to do?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bedke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt; Well, it is certainly a hindrance within the
stakeholder community. The creation of the sagebrush focal 
areas, as Congressman Amodei referenced, plus the buffer zones, 
plus the stubble height requirements seem more designed to 
limit livestock grazing than anything else.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    The Chairman. And we will not even go into detail of what &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Well, it is certainly a hindrance within the
stakeholder community. The creation of the sagebrush focal 
areas, as Congressman Amodei referenced, plus the buffer zones, 
plus the stubble height requirements seem more designed to 
limit livestock grazing than anything else.
happens if you let that growth take place without any kind of 
limitations to it, without any kind of grazing on it. 
Eventually what happens when it gets old and dies and cuts out 
any kind of new growth, it becomes fodder for wildfires, making 
it even more dangerous than it was before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;There is one thing I just want to notice, that from the 
four of you that are here, you are representing Idaho, Utah, 
Montana, and Nevada. And, as was mentioned by the Ranking 
Member, in private lands there has been great control as far as 
habitat. I think it was also mentioned by Mr. Tubbs, you have 
done great habitat on your private lands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Fifty-four percent of the West is owned by the Federal 
Government. Montana, though, is about 20 percent below that 
average. You bring the average down there. You have much more 
private land than the rest of the states have. No offense. You 
and California lower the average for the rest of us here. You 
have more private property, which means you should do a better 
job in managing than the other states do. If not, it is on your 
head.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;I know Utah would love to have something like 30 percent of 
Utah or even 54 percent of Utah owned by the Federal 
Government. We don't. We have a much more difficult problem, 
which means the state has control over these areas, but not on 
the Federal lands. And I realize in Nevada you don't have 
squat, as far as private lands in the state of Nevada. 
Everything has to go through this process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;What you four gentlemen have illustrated is that every 
state is indeed different, and it has been brought out by 
several Members here. Every plan has to be different. If we 
really care about the bird, if we care about not just 
controlling anything, but rehabilitation of the species, it has 
to be done differently. And that was what the original intent 
that Secretary Salazar said. And at one time that was the 
approach that you all went through in coming up with state 
plans, and then it was cut off.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;Mr. Tubbs, I think you said it. One time the governors were 
simply cut off of the process, and then brought back in 
afterwards. Too late. And that is why there have been a lot of 
lawsuits by governors from different states in the West, 
because they were cut off and then brought back too late.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;If we really want to solve this problem, you have to let 
state plans go into effect, and you have to give them a chance 
to show that they can actually accomplish their results, and 
that is going to take a couple of years to do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;But what we are doing right now is wrong, and I applaud 
this Administration for trying to see if we can roll it back. 
But what we have to do is roll back in an intelligent way to 
make sure that the states are not only just given the 
authority, but also are not going to be limited in what their 
authority does by outside sources or outside limitations that 
come in there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;I thank all four of you for being here. I thank the 
Committee also for being here and the questions they have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Bedke"&gt;    Are there other questions on another round?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grijalva&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;No, Mr. Chairman. Just to enter into the
record from Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness, Mr. 
Feehan, on a response to a question regarding the Endangered 
Species Act and effect on military preparedness, in which he 
says that the current status without any legislative change 
protects their interest, in terms of preparation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;And to just clarify that response by Director Tubbs was in 
terms of inclusion in the review of the current plans had to do 
with this present Administration, not the former.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;    With that, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;    The Chairman. Is there anyone else?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;With that, I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Then, if not, for our witnesses, once again, thank you for 
being here. I appreciate that. The public record will stay open 
for a while.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;If there are other questions that Members have, they may be 
submitted to you. We would ask you to respond to those. Those 
will all be part of the record in a timely fashion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Where is my other sheet of what I have to say at the very 
end? No one can go until I say it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Well, it is not there, not there, or not there. Oh, well, 
thank you for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;    The Chairman. There is something I have to say, and it is &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;[Laughter.]
we are adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;[Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;[ADDITIONAL MATERIALS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD]
  Prepared Statement of Gary R. Herbert, Governor of the State of Utah&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for holding 
this important hearing. I appreciate you inviting me to share with you 
and members of this Committee some thoughts on management concepts for 
public lands as they pertain to ``Empowering States in Sage Grouse 
Management.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;introduction&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;It is easy to come and testify against unpopular Federal programs. 
That is not my purpose today. I am here to deliver a message about our 
successes and what is needed to protect sage-grouse, western habitats, 
and hardworking Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Catastrophic wildfire has become a major concern across the 
American West. This year, the Federal Government has spent $2 billion 
on wildfire control. This is a new record and a tremendously burdensome 
expenditure for the American taxpayer. The fires were so bad that the 
smoke plume literally spanned the Nation this summer. Some of America's 
most pristine forests, national parks, and vistas burned for months. 
The impacts of catastrophic wildlife to the lives of millions of 
Americans cannot be understated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;watershed restoration initiative&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;When it comes to sage-grouse, our Number one concern in the state 
of Utah is wildfire. In 2007, Utah experienced a severe wildfire 
season. The state's wildfires in sage-grouse areas were particularly 
bad. One catastrophic wildfire burned over 200,000 acres in central 
Utah. The wildfire burned so hot, that it jumped a multi-lane 
interstate freeway and actually killed a driver. As a state, we 
assessed the problem and took action. We raised millions of dollars in 
private and state funding. We began to address the root causes of 
catastrophic wildfire in sage-grouse habitats and began to restore Utah 
watersheds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;This program, The Utah Watershed Restoration Initiative, has 
completed hundreds of projects in the last 10 years. Over 40 private, 
state, and Federal partners contribute to this program financially. We 
have invested over 150 million dollars and treated approximately 1.5 
million acres. By any standard, this program has been an overwhelming 
success. It has not only saved the state from wildfire, it has saved 
hundreds of millions of dollars in firefighting costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;These projects do more than just control wildfire. They restore our 
watersheds, native vegetative communities, and dramatically enhance 
habitat for wildlife. These areas are wetter, produce more runoff, and 
they dramatically increase the resilience and redundancy of habitats 
for sage-grouse. Our researchers are documenting dramatic measurable 
improvements in habitat utilization, nesting success, and population 
response of sage-grouse in these restored areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;results for wildfire&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;The Watershed Restoration Initiative is working to control 
wildfire. We have fewer fires in our Sage Grouse Management Areas. 
Naturally occurring fires are smaller and easier to put out. 
Catastrophic wildfire numbers are a mere fraction of what these were 
just 10 years ago.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;One measure of success: ``Total acres burned'' has improved 
dramatically. From 1999-2007, the 9 years before these conservation 
actions, wildfires within the state of Utah burned 628,663 acres within 
Utah Sage Grouse Management Areas. This amounts to 8.7 percent of 
acreage within Utah's SGMAs in a 9-year period.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;From 2008-2016, the 9 years after these conservation actions were 
commenced, wildfires within the state of Utah burned 114,111 acres 
within Utah's Sage Grouse Management Areas. This amounts to 1.5 percent 
of acreage within Utah's SMGAs that were impacted by wildfire during 
the 9-year period.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;This is fivefold improvement since just 2008. Just as importantly, 
this means that 514,552 fewer acres were burned by wildfire in the last 
9 years compared to the 9 years before the Watershed Restoration 
Initiative Commenced. The improvement within Utah's SGMAs is 
significant and demonstrates that Utah's regulatory system is more than 
adequate to control the threat of wildfire.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;why this matters&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;I am here to do more than just share a feel good success story of a 
program that is working. I am here to protect these programs. In 2015, 
the Obama administration issued new Federal land use plans in the name 
of sage-grouse. This followed 30 years of listing petitions that 
claimed that western states could not manage sage-grouse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;We understand the needs of our sage-grouse, and their unique 
habitats within the state. We have protected and grown our grouse 
populations for decades. We have studied and adaptively managed for 
sage-grouse success. We have spent tens of millions of dollars to 
protect, restore, enhance, and grow sage-grouse habitat in the state of 
Utah. The state, stakeholders, and citizens support these common-sense 
programs that work for Utah and its citizens. Our investment in sage-
grouse conservation has been very successful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;federal plans hurt programs needed the most&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;The new BLM and Forest Service sage-grouse plan amendments are 
aimed at imposing more regulations on the state of Utah. Let me be very 
direct so there can be no confusion. These new regulations are a far 
cry from ``collaboration'' or ``balance.'' In fact, these plans 
undermine the programs that are doing the most for sage-grouse in Utah.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Let me give you one example. The Federal sage-grouse plans are 
based on a paradigm of regulation, not conservation. Take oil and gas 
drilling. Documents obtained by the state of Utah show that Federal 
officials are mandating ``no surface occupancy'' for oil and gas 
drilling within Utah's Sage Grouse Management Areas. Is oil and gas a 
big problem in Utah's Sage Grouse Management Areas? Not at all. In 
fact, there are less than 200 active oil and gas wells on the 7.4 
million acres of Utah's SGMAs. This is far below the oil and gas 
density levels for priority habitat agreed upon with Federal officials.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Ninety-four percent of Utah's sage-grouse are protected within 
Utah's Sage Grouse Management Areas. This is the highest percentage of 
birds protected within core areas of any western state. This is also 
our best sage-grouse habitat. Instead of looking for ways to augment 
the Watershed Restoration Initiative that has saved 500,000 acres from 
wildfire and post wildfire effects, Federal sage-grouse plans were 
focused on a few oil and gas wells.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;It gets worse. The state of Utah relies on economic activity in 
areas outside of our Sage Grouse Management Areas help pay for Utah's 
Watershed Restoration Initiative. These new regulations have 
essentially brought much of the new economic activity in areas outside 
of Utah's SGMAs to a standstill. What this means is that funding from 
mitigation, sportsmen, and state tax revenues are being lost. This 
threatens the one program, (i.e. the Watershed Restoration Initiative) 
that is doing the most to protect and restore sage-grouse in the state 
of Utah.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;These Federal sage-grouse plans may be well intentioned, but they 
are a threat to the partnerships, funding, and collaboration that makes 
Utah's Watershed Restoration Initiative Work. Let me be clear: These 
BLM and Forest Service Plans are bad for conservation, bad for Utahns, 
and bad for sage-grouse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;good intentions unintended consequences&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Good intentions do not make good policy. This year the Federal 
Government has spent $2 billion trying to control western wildfires. 
This is the most that has ever been spent in American history. For 100 
years, we have controlled the natural fire cycle that kept stands of 
invasive pinyon and juniper trees in check. Litigation has stopped most 
logging and forest thinning needed to control the fuel loads. Federal 
regulators continue to cut cattle and sheep grazing which also are an 
important fire prevention measure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;These ill-advised policies are not working. Western states must now 
live with the catastrophic wildfires, toxic smoke filled air, loss of 
homes and businesses, and even the loss of human life. Certainly, this 
was not the outcome environmental activists expected. However, it is 
the good citizens of my state who must live with the unintended 
consequences of these failed policies on a daily basis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;let western states manage&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;My earnest petition is that Congress let the people who are 
impacted the most enact the policies needed to protect our families, 
and our communities. Western states are in the best spot to look beyond 
the good intentions and consider the very real, and very disastrous, 
real world impacts of these policies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;I am asking you to protect a program that is unrivaled in the 
Nation. The success of our Watershed Restoration Initiative in 
restoring and protecting sage-grouse is one of the reasons why Utah's 
legislature passed a nearly unanimous bipartisan resolution in support 
of a bill introduced by Congressman Bishop to protect Utah's sage-
grouse conservation efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;It is time to revitalize and replace outdated Federal land 
policies. The new era of public lands will be one in which state and 
local entities take on a greater role and will use their skill, 
flexibility, and innovation to meet the recreation, environmental, and 
energy needs of the 21st century.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Congress must look at these policies from a conservation, fiscal, 
and human standpoint. Let our state's programs continue to work. Take 
action and pass legislation that throws out these ill-advised Great 
Basin BLM and Forest Service Land Use Plans. Protect the proven on-the-
ground conservation programs that are working for sage-grouse, sage-
grouse habitats, and hardworking Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

The Honorable Adam Smith

    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Dear Representative Smith:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;This letter is in response to your request regarding the Greater 
Sage-grouse and whether a future decision to list the species under the 
Endangered Species Act would affect military training, operations, and 
readiness.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;The Department of the Army is closely monitoring the status of the 
Greater Sage-grouse and its relationship to the Army mission. We 
currently believe that existing statutory authorities adequately 
protect the interests of the Department and we do not anticipate a need 
for additional legislation from Congress. The Army's responses to your 
specific questions are attached.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Thank you for your inquiry into this matter and your continued 
support of the Army, our Soldiers and their Families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Enclosure&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;*****
1. How would the land use plans, and other requirements for protection 
of the Greater Sage-grouse and its habitat, affect military training, 
operations, or readiness? The Army has reviewed relevant portions of 
Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, and state management 
plans and does not believe these plans will affect Army training, 
operations, or readiness to any significant degree. Army installations 
such as Yakima Training Center with a resident population of greater 
sage-grouse have already included conservation measures for this 
species in their Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP). 
INRMPs and the species conservation measures therein are approved by 
both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the state 
conservation agency. The Greater Sage-grouse conservation measures in 
the INRMP have not prevented Yakima Training Center from meeting its 
military mission.
2. If the Greater Sage-grouse were to be listed as threatened or 
endangered under the ESA, what affect would that decision have on 
military training, operations, or readiness? If the species were to be 
listed as threatened or endangered, consultation under Section 7 of the 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) would be required for actions on Army 
lands that may affect the species. While there had been some concern 
that listing the Greater Sage-grouse may result in additional 
restrictions, the Army now expects the USFWS to take into account the 
Greater Sage-grouse conservation measures we have implemented through 
our INRMPs, rather than requiring additional restrictions or mitigation 
actions. We also expect our installations would be exempt from the 
designation of critical habitat because of the conservation measures in 
our INRMPs. Therefore, considering these expectations, the Army does 
not anticipate a significant impact to military training, operations, 
or readiness if the species is listed under the ESA.
3. How do the Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans (INRMPs) 
allow for both training and wildlife conservation at U.S. military 
installations while not adversely affecting military training, 
operations, or readiness? Army INRMPs establish conservation measures 
for the natural resources on Army installations that are consistent 
with the military use of our installations and ensure that there is no 
net loss in the capability of installation lands to support the 
military mission. Army INRMPs arc developed by the Army's installation 
natural resource managers in close coordination with our training range 
managers and installation commanders. This ensures that there are 
effective species conservation measures and that those measures are 
tailored to the installation military mission to avoid adverse effects 
to mission.
4. What statutory authorities does the Department of Defense have to 
address potential conflicts that may arise in the future to ensure that 
military training, operations, and readiness will not be adversely 
affected? Does the Department believe these authorities are sufficient 
to protect the interests of the Department of Defense without 
additional legislation from Congress? Congress made several important 
changes to Section 4 of the ESA in 2003 that provide DoD the 
authorities to address conflicts. ESA subparagraph 4(a)(3)(B) exempts 
military lands from critical habitat designation if the lands are 
covered by an approved INRMP that provides a benefit to the subject 
species. The DoD may also rely on ESA paragraph 4(b)(2) to exclude the 
installation from critical habitat designation based on potential 
impacts to national security. The DoD may also invoke subsection 7(j) 
of the ESA. This provision directs the Endangered Species Committee to 
grant an exemption for any action the Secretary of Defense believes is 
necessary for reasons of national security. The cited authorities are 
sufficient to protect the interests of the Army without additional 
legislation from Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Oil and gas leasing and development
Only lands within one mile of active leks are closed to leasing. 
Agencies are required to prioritize oil and gas leasing and development 
outside sage-grouse habitat. Neither the Rocky Mountain Record of 
Decision nor the Northwest Colorado Plan specify methods for 
prioritization--focusing instead on what BLM state offices should 
``consider.'' Similarly, BLM's guidance (IM 2016-143) provides a set of 
``factors to consider'' in prioritizing leasing and development, 
including:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Parcels immediately adjacent or proximate to existing oil&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;and gas leases and development operations or other land use&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;development should be more appropriate for consideration&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Greater Sage-grouse Conservation--The Collaboration Continues
The BLM's Greater Sage-grouse Plans provide a framework for managing 
the activities on our public lands in a way that preserves multiple 
use, sustains the land for future generations, and meets the 
conservation goals for sage-grouse and the sagebrush habitat. Thanks to 
these plans, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the greater 
sage-grouse no longer required listing under the Endangered Species 
Act, a status we can keep with thoughtful implementation in each state 
and region. The collaborative framework provides discretion to BLM 
state and field offices. This allows them to work with cooperating 
agencies and other partners, to determine the best way to achieve the 
goals and objectives of the plans in the context of proposed uses.
An overview of the discretion available to the BLM to manage major 
public land uses under the Montana Plans \1\ is provided below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;\1\ These plans provide management for all but Southwestern 
Montana, which is managed under a separate sage-grouse plan that 
contains similarly flexible provisions as the Montana Plans.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consistency with Montana's plan&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Montana Plans are designed to be consistent with the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;State of Montana's sage-grouse plan and to ensure that&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;sage-grouse are managed similarly on state, private and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="681" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;federal lands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="682" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Montana Plans contain a built-in review process&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="683" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;allowing for changes, including to disturbance caps, based&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Protective measures&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Practices, such as avoiding large-scale transmission&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;lines, to preserve land and vegetation, are limited to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;sage-grouse habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="689" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The strongest measures, for instance only allowing oil and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="690" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;gas development without surface disturbance, are only&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;targeted on the most important habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; These habitat areas are identified by state and federal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="693" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;scientists.
Avoidance
The Plans' framework, rather than closing lands to uses, identifies 
potentially harmful uses that should be avoided but may be permitted as 
needed, even in high quality habitat, such as:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="694" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Wind energy development in General and Restoration Habitat&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Management Areas&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;lines--in General, Restoration and Priority Habitat&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Restoration and Priority Habitat Management Areas
Oil and gas leasing and development
No areas are closed to leasing. Agencies are required to prioritize oil 
and gas leasing and development outside sage-grouse habitat. Neither 
the Rocky Mountain Record of Decision nor the Montana Plans specify 
methods for prioritization--focusing instead on what BLM state offices 
should ``consider.'' Similarly, BLM's guidance (IM 2016-143) provides a 
set of ``factors to consider'' in prioritizing leasing and development, 
including:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Parcels immediately adjacent or proximate to existing oil&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;and gas leases and development operations or other land use&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;development should be more appropriate for consideration&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Greater Sage-grouse Conservation--The Collaboration Continues
The BLM's Greater Sage-grouse Plans provide a framework for managing 
the activities on our public lands in a way that preserves multiple 
use, sustains the land for future generations, and meets the 
conservation goals for sage-grouse and the sagebrush habitat. Thanks to 
these plans, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the greater 
sage-grouse no longer required listing under the Endangered Species 
Act, a status we can keep with thoughtful implementation in each state

Greater Sage-grouse Conservation--The Collaboration Continues
The BLM's Greater Sage-grouse Plans provide a framework for managing 
the activities on our public lands in a way that preserves multiple 
use, sustains the land for future generations, and meets the 
conservation goals for sage-grouse and the sagebrush habitat. Thanks to 
these plans, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the greater 
sage-grouse no longer required listing under the Endangered Species 
Act, a status we can keep with thoughtful implementation in each state 
and region. The collaborative framework provides discretion to BLM 
state and field offices. This allows them to work with cooperating 
agencies and other partners, to determine the best way to achieve the 
goals and objectives of the plans in the context of proposed uses.
An overview of the discretion available to the BLM to manage major 
public land uses under the Utah Plan is provided below.
Protective measures&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="961" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Practices, such as avoiding large-scale transmission&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="963" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;sage-grouse habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="964" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The strongest measures, for instance only allowing oil and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="965" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;gas development without surface disturbance, are only&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="966" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;targeted on the most important habitat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="967" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; These habitat areas are identified by state and federal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="968" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;scientists.
Avoidance
The Plan's framework, rather than closing lands to uses, identifies 
potentially harmful uses that should be avoided but may be permitted as 
needed, even in high quality habitat, such as:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="969" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Major rights-of-way/infrastructure--such as transmission&lt;/paragraph&gt;

The Utah Plan provides for BLM to permit uses without specifying in 
detail how protections will be managed for:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="973" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Major rights-of-way/infrastructure in General Habitat&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="980" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;Areas
Oil and gas leasing and development
No areas are closed to leasing. Agencies are required to prioritize oil 
and gas leasing and development outside sage-grouse habitat. Neither 
the Great Basin Record of Decision, Rocky Mountain Record of Decision 
nor the Utah Plan specify methods for prioritization--focusing instead 
on what BLM state offices should ``consider.'' Similarly, BLM's 
guidance (IM 2016-143) provides a set of ``factors to consider'' in 
prioritizing leasing and development, including:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="981" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Parcels immediately adjacent or proximate to existing oil&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="983" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;development should be more appropriate for consideration&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="985" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Parcels that are within existing Federal oil and gas units&lt;/paragraph&gt;

The Plans' framework, rather than closing lands to uses, identifies 
potentially harmful uses that should be avoided but may be permitted as

Oil and gas leasing and development
No areas are closed to leasing. Agencies are required to prioritize oil 
and gas leasing and development outside sage-grouse habitat. Neither 
the Rocky Mountain Record of Decision nor the Wyoming Plans specify 
methods for prioritization--focusing instead on what BLM state offices 
should ``consider.'' Similarly, BLM's guidance (IM 2016-143) provides a 
set of ``factors to consider'' in prioritizing leasing and development,
