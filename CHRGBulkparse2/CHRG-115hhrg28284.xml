    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PETE OLSON, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Good morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;The Subcommittee on Energy will now come to order. The 
chair now recognizes himself for 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;When the Trump administration proposed to zero out the 
Energy Star program earlier this year, it got people talking. 
Many manufacturers said Energy Star is worth saving but that 
there is room for improvement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;This is a discussion draft. I repeat, discussion draft, and 
offers possible solutions--and I repeat, possible--possible 
solutions and reforms.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;It would make the DOE the lead agency for Energy Star while 
requiring them to consult with the EPA. Today, each 
administration can choose whether EPA or DOE runs the show. 
This is an energy program, which is why some want the 
Department of Energy in the driver's seat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;This draft also has liability protections like what's in a 
bill by my friends Bob Latta from Ohio and Peter Welch from 
Vermont. Energy Star has its own penalties for those who break 
the rules. We don't need more lawyers involved on top of that. 
And I say that as a member of the Texas Bar and active with a 
UT law degree on my wall.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;This draft also creates more chances for industry input in 
the program. I look forward to hearing your thoughts about any 
and all sections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;One other point--last Friday, our Democratic colleagues 
sent a letter asking to delay this hearing because they wanted 
a government panel. You should know that staff tried but 
couldn't get the appropriate witnesses. We need to have a high 
level panel with live bodies confirmed by the Senate. Our 
friends there have to move forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;But both EPA and DOE have submitted statements and comments 
and will respond to any questions for the record that they get. 
And we will remind them that they need to be prompt with their 
answers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Pete Olson&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Pete Olson"&gt;At this point, I would like to give the balance of my time 
to Mr. Latta, who has been a leader on these issues for years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Pete Olson"&gt;When the Trump administration proposed to zero out the 
Energy Star program earlier this year, it got people talking. 
Many manufacturers said Energy Star is worth saving, but that 
there is room for improvement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Pete Olson"&gt;This discussion draft offers several possible reforms.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Pete Olson"&gt;It would make DOE the lead agency for Energy Star, while 
giving them the power to bring EPA in. Today, each 
administration can choose whether EPA or DOE runs the show. 
This is an energy program, which is why some want DOE in the 
driver's seat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Pete Olson"&gt;The draft also has liability protections like what's in a 
bill by my friends Rep. Latta and Welch. Energy Star has its 
own penalties for those who break the rules--we don't need to 
get more lawyers involved on top of that. And I say that as 
someone with a UT Law degree on my wall.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Pete Olson"&gt;The draft also creates more chances for industry input in 
the program, among other things. I look forward to hearing 
thoughts about any and all sections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Pete Olson"&gt;One other point. Last Friday, our Democratic colleagues 
sent a letter asking to delay this hearing because they wanted 
a government panel. I'm told that staff tried but couldn't get 
the right witnesses. I think we need a few more live bodies 
confirmed by our friends in the Senate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Pete Olson"&gt;BUT, both EPA and DOE have submitted statements and will 
respond to any questions for the record they get. We will 
remind them that they need to be prompt with the answers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Pete Olson"&gt;    At this point I would like to yield my time to Mr. Latta 
who has been a leader on these issues for years.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Well, thanks very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you very much for yielding, and to our panel of witnesses 
today, thanks very much for being here. We really appreciate it 
for this discussion that we are going to have today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Energy Star program has been a win-win for consumers and 
manufacturers over the past 25 years. This program has proven 
to be a successful tool in advancing the development and use of 
efficient energy technologies. It has also promoted economic 
expansion and job growth for participating manufacturers across 
the nation including many across my home State of Ohio.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;This hearing today is a starting point for reforming Energy 
Star program. We have heard from stakeholders that reforms are 
needed to Energy Star and that this draft is an opportunity to 
discuss those ideas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;I want today to be a step in the process toward building a 
strong bill that shows support for this program while making 
the necessary changes that we need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;I am looking forward to the testimony. I hope that the 
engagement of these issues will not stop after today's hearing. 
We need to hear from all the stakeholders about reform ideas so 
that we can move this package forward. I have an open-door 
policy and I hope that anyone who is interested will share 
their thoughts, concerns, and suggestions with me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;One provision in the draft directly addresses a recent 
trend that has led to a chilled participation in the program. 
This language protects manufacturers that have fallen out of 
compliance if they have complied with all corrective measures 
and penalties from litigation related to noncompliance. The 
draft also moves the primary responsibility of the program to 
the Department of Energy since the heart of this program is 
helping consumers make energy-efficient choices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Additionally, we will look at opportunities for more 
transparency and public engagement in the standard-setting 
process. The Energy Star program is widely recognized by 
consumers and has seen major investments by the manufacturing 
community over the past two decades.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;The updates we are considering today are important for 
ensuring that this program remains strong. I want to again 
thank the committee for holding today's hearing and I also look 
forward to hearing from our witnesses, and I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;    Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BOBBY L. RUSH, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. BOBBY L. RUSH"&gt;    Now the chair calls upon a man who's very happy that my 
Houston Astros took the place of his Chicago Cubs as the World 
Series champs, the subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Rush, for 5 
minutes for an opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rush&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I have never been introduced like
that before and I am stunned with that introduction. But thank 
you anyway, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Mr. Chairman, as you know, Ranking Member Pallone and 
myself, we sent a letter to you and Chairman Walden on Friday 
asking that this hearing be postponed until representatives 
from the EPA and from the DOE were made available to testify 
before this subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Mr. Chairman, it is highly unusually and wholly 
unacceptable that we are now in the month of November and the 
administration witnesses have been allowed to repeatedly thumb 
their noses at requests made by this subcommittee to get them 
to come here and to testify before the representatives of the 
American people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I am very deeply concerned and disturbed that 
this subcommittee seems to be completely feckless in persuading 
the administrative officials to provide testimony on pending 
legislation and to engage members in person as has been the 
tradition of this subcommittee for as long as I can remember 
and for as long as I have been on this subcommittee. At some 
point very soon, Mr. Chairman, I would hope that we would use 
all the power available to us to convince representatives of 
this administration to answer our call when they receive an 
invitation from this subcommittee to come before us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I think it does not do us well for us to 
continue to accept these refusals to come before this 
subcommittee, to continually accept this restraint and 
disregard for this subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;And Mr. Chairman, to me it's the epitome, rather, of 
foolhardiness for us to continually give government officials 
from this administration namby-pamby excuses for not coming 
here before this subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I can only imagine the howls and the growls 
and the threats that we would have heard from your side of the 
aisle if former EPA administrators, Gina McCarthy or Lisa 
Jackson, would have simply refused to even show up in person or 
even send a representative in their place to answer members' 
questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I think it is time to bring this kind of 
disrespect to a screeching halt and I hope that you and the 
Republican members of this subcommittee will be as outraged at 
this inaction and this disrespect from the administration. Show 
up before us and let's have some real discussion about 
politics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Mr. Chairman, for these two bills before us, I support H.R. 
3477, the Ceiling Fan Energy and Conservation Harmonization 
Act, and I strongly oppose the Energy Star Reform Act of 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I am going to yield right now the balance of 
my time to the gentleman from Vermont.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Rush.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;This Energy Star draft is a step, and I appreciate the 
intent of the drafters. Energy Star has had 25 years of a 
fantastic success.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;It has done a lot since 1992 on a voluntary program, saving 
consumers and businesses $430 billion on their utility bills 
and reducing carbon emissions by 3 billion metric tons, and I 
appreciate the work of Mr. Walden, Mr. Upton, and Mr. Latta, 
who I have worked with very, very closely in putting this draft 
out there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;I appreciate the effort of Mr. Latta to maintain the 
development of energy efficiency appliances through Energy Star 
by preventing the need for class action, something he and I 
worked on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;That said, here's the concerns I have about proposed 
changes in the current draft that I hope we can address. I 
think moving the program from EPA to DOE is a significant 
issue, instituting the Administrative Procedure Act standards 
and allowing for self-certification of certain products. All of 
these, in my view, could be detrimental to the continued 
effectiveness of this program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;So I look forward to working with my colleagues. This is a 
bipartisan effort and I thank the authors of the draft 
legislation for getting us moving.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    Thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;The chair, responding to the ranking member's concerns 
about the people ignoring this committee, I remind my good 
friend it took us 10 months--10 months to have our first 
cabinet secretary, Rick Perry, speak before this committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;The problem about this committee, it's a slow confirmation 
process in the Senate. We tried to get witnesses. We tried. We 
tried. But there is none available that have the stature we 
need to do our job.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREG WALDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GREG WALDEN"&gt;    And so we're going forward. With that, I yield to the 
chairman of the full committee, Mr. Walden, for 5 minutes' 
opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I thank the gentleman and appreciate his
comments. That is what we face. We share the frustration the 
minority has expressed today about the inability to have the 
administration's people confirmed by Senate and in place so we 
would have somebody that could give us the administration's 
perspective on these matters of legislation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Our committee's energy focus is not limited to energy 
production and delivery. As you all know, we are also 
interested in policies that promote energy efficiency. Doing 
more with less is always a win for consumers, for 
manufacturers, for jobs, the environment, and for the economy 
overall.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;H.R. 3477, the Ceiling Fan Energy Conservation 
Harmonization Act, authored by my good friend from North 
Carolina, Mr. Hudson, is one of the two bills that we will 
examine today. This legislation would align the compliance date 
of the next efficiency standard for ceiling fans with the 
compliance date for ceiling fan lights so the manufacturers can 
deal with both at the same time. What a concept. Amazing we 
have to pass legislation to fix something like this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Shifting gears, I believe the Energy Star program is a nice 
complement to the mandatory federal energy efficiency standards 
for many energy-using products in that it helps consumers 
identify those models that go above and beyond the minimum 
standards. I know I look at that and my wife does when we buy 
different appliances and things. It's a guide. Surveys show 
that consumers are aware of the Energy Star label, that many of 
them look for it when making their purchasing decisions. In 
addition to appliances, Energy Star also helps building owners 
and renters save on energy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;The Energy Star program received a great deal of attention 
earlier this year when the administration's FY 2018 budget 
proposed to zero out the program. I certainly disagreed with 
this approach but I do believe the program could be improved 
upon and now is a great time to kick off that dialogue. Today's 
hearing will focus on our discussion draft of Energy Star 
reforms. Keep in mind this is just a draft. We welcome 
constructive criticisms of what it contains as well as 
suggestions for things that we should add onto it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;One of the quirks of the Energy Star program is that it has 
no permanent lead agency. Each new administration can decide 
how to divide responsibilities between the Department of Energy 
and the Environment Protection Administration, or agency. And 
in 2009, the Obama administration shifted the lead to EPA. In 
my mind, Energy Star is fundamentally an energy program and 
belongs at the Department of Energy. I understand that many 
participants in the program are happy with it being at EPA now. 
The discussion draft proposes to make DOE the lead agency while 
still giving EPA an important role. And, again, I stress that 
this is just a discussion draft and we welcome all comments on 
how the program should be structured.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;As I mentioned, Energy Star is a well-functioning program 
overall but there are areas for improvement. The discussion 
draft addresses some of these such as protections against 
unhelpful class action litigation as well as assurances that 
companies have a chance to comment on major actions under the 
program. It also has provisions to help safeguard consumer 
choice.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I would also like to note that thoughtful legislating often 
takes time. This is the first of what I am sure will be several 
hearings and markups on legislation. Today's hearing is focused 
on a discussion draft and has yet to be formally introduced. I 
am looking forward to receiving feedback again from all the 
stakeholders including EPA and DOE as we continue to move 
through the legislative process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;As we discuss potential changes to the program we can't 
lose sight that consumers are the reason for the Energy Star 
and that the focus should always be on what is best for the 
consumer. Any ideas that improve the process by which consumers 
get the information they can use to save on their energy bills 
is something we would like to hear about. So I thank the 
witnesses for participating in this hearing. I look forward to 
your testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Greg Walden&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my 
time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Our committee's energy focus is not limited to energy 
production and delivery--we are also very interested in 
policies that promote energy efficiency. Doing more with less 
is always a win for consumers, for manufacturers, for jobs, the

this approach, but I do believe that the program could be 
improved upon and now is a great time to kick off that 
dialogue. Today's hearing will focus on our discussion draft of 
Energy Star reforms. Keep in mind that this is just a draft--we 
welcome constructive criticisms of what it contains as well as 
suggestions for things we should add to it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;One of the quirks with the Energy Star program is that it 
has no permanent lead agency. Each new administration can 
decide how to divide responsibilities between DOE and EPA, and 
in 2009 the Obama administration shifted the lead to EPA. In my 
mind, Energy Star is fundamentally an energy program and 
belongs at DOE, but I understand that many participants in the 
program are happy with EPA. The discussion draft proposes to 
make DOE the lead agency while still giving EPA an important 
role, but again I stress that this is just a discussion draft 
and I welcome all comments on how the program should be 
structured.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;As I mentioned, Energy Star is a well-functioning program 
overall, but there are areas for improvement. The discussion 
draft addresses some of these, such as protections against 
unhelpful class action litigation as well as assurances that 
companies have a chance to comment on major actions under the 
program. It also has provisions to that help safeguard consumer 
choice.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;I'd also like to note that thoughtful legislating often 
takes time. This is the first--of what I'm sure will be 
several--hearings and markups on the legislation. Today's 
hearing is focused on a discussion draft that has yet to be 
formally introduced and I'm looking forward to receiving 
feedback from all stakeholders--including EPA and DOE--as we 
continue to move through the legislative process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;As we discuss potential changes to the program, we cannot 
lose sight that consumers are the reason for Energy Star and 
that the focus should always be on them. Any idea that improves 
the process by which consumers get the information they can use 
to save on their energy bills is something we would like to 
hear about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;I thank the witnesses for their participation in this 
hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR., A REPRESENTATIVEIN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. FRANK PALLONE"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the ranking member of the full 
committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Today's hearing will look at two pieces of legislation 
relating to energy efficiency, a very troubling discussion 
draft entitled the Energy Star Reform Act of 2017 and another 
bill, H.R. 3477, the Ceiling Fan Energy Conservation 
Harmonization Act, that seems to have no opposition.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;But before I discuss the legislation, I must say that it's 
totally unacceptable to have a legislative hearing on a bill 
that will make major changes to the Energy Star program without 
witnesses from the Environmental Protection Agency and the 
Department of Energy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Unfortunately, the Trump administration's blatant refusal 
to participate in our committee's legislative process has been 
a common theme since President Trump took office in January.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;It is now November and we are expected to believe that 
there is not a single person at EPA who can discuss the impact 
of a bill that completely moves the Energy Star program to DOE.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I have looked at the committee records and both the Obama 
and Bush administrations were able to get EPA witnesses 
including the administrator up here within 3 months of taking 
office.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;It has been almost 10 months now and this committee has yet 
to have a single EPA witness before us and that is simply 
unacceptable. If the administration's absence is due to a 
scheduling conflict then today's hearing should have been 
postponed. But if they're just refusing to appear before our 
committee to discuss any legislative proposal then we should 
not accept that. On Friday, Ranking Member Rush and I asked 
that this hearing be postponed until we could have both EPA and 
DOE before us. Clearly, that did not happen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;But I would hope that committee Republicans would join us 
in saying enough is enough. The days of the administration 
hiding are over. It is time that they appeared before us so 
that we can hear their thoughts on the legislation that we are 
considering.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Now let me move to one of the bills before us. I have 
serious concerns with the Energy Star Reform Act of 2017 
discussion draft, which makes several significant changes to 
the Energy Star program, and I have one question. What problem 
are we trying to solve with this proposal? The Energy Star 
program is extremely successful, reducing energy consumption 
and saving consumers money. According to EPA, in 2014 alone 
this completely voluntary program saved consumers $34 billion 
on their utility bills while stopping the release of 300 
million metric tons of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. 
This program is a win-win for consumers and the environment and 
yet this bill is proposing major changes including taking the 
program out of EPA and moving it to DOE.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Energy Star was originally established at EPA and the 
program was codified into law with EPA as the co-lead agency in 
the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was produced by a 
Republican Congress and president. It remains an extremely 
effective and popular volunteer program so, again, why the need 
for change.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I have yet to hear a credible argument from anyone as to 
why this is necessary. The discussion draft also requires that 
product certifications and other program specifications be done 
using the administrative procedure act process which would 
require every product certification be published in the Federal 
Register and be subject to public notice and comment. And I 
worry that this will make the program less nimble and harm both 
consumers and companies by opening the process to new needless 
litigation from companies who otherwise couldn't meet Energy 
Star standards.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Two other provisions in the draft would harm consumers who 
purchase products under this popular program. The no warranty 
subsection would create a liability shield, blocking consumers 
from recovering costs when the Energy Star labeled product they 
bought turns out to be mislabeled and doesn't achieve the 
energy savings promised. And another provision would allow 
companies to once again deem their products to be energy 
efficient with little to no outside verification of those 
claims. GAO warned us back in 2010 that the Energy Star program 
was vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse due to its self-
certification policy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So EPA implemented reforms including a third party 
certification program to ensure products with the Energy Star 
label actually save energy. Rolling back this critical reform 
would endanger the long-term viability of the Energy Star 
program. It is particularly reckless when combined with the 
liability shield because it would leave consumers with no 
outside verification of manufacturer claims or removing a 
critical avenue for consumers to make whole if the 
manufacturer's claims prove to be wrong.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So, again, Energy Star is a program that enjoys broad 
support from American consumers, manufacturers, and efficiency 
advocates. It is a voluntary program and companies can choose 
not to participate. The changes in this draft would undermine 
the integrity of the Energy Star label, Incentivize companies 
to cheat the system, and allow bad actors who lie about the 
efficiency of their products to get off scot free. In all these 
scenarios, consumers are left paying the price for the 
legislative mistakes proposed in this draft.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    And I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the
future of Energy Star.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers represents 
the producers of the vast majority of home appliances purchased 
by U.S. consumers. Our members are strong supporters of the 
Energy Star program. AHAM has significant experience with the 
Energy Star program, having worked closely with EPA and DOE 
since the program's inception for home appliances in 1996.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;AHAM is an Energy Star verification testing body approved 
by both agencies. Because the Energy Star brand is known to 
more than 80 percent of consumers nationwide, AHAM strongly 
supports maintenance of the program within the federal 
government. This program should not be privatized or 
eliminated. The program should be adequately funded. But we 
strongly believe the program should be improved in recognition 
of its significant role in the marketplace.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Energy efficiency gains across core major appliance 
categories have been dramatic over the past decades. A new 
clothes washer today uses 70 percent less energy than it did in 
1990 and less than half the water. Energy Star has played a 
critical role in educating consumers on the benefits of energy 
efficiency and it had become so ubiquitous that it is now 
referenced in building codes. It is part of utility rebates, 
federal procurement, and retail buyer specifications. Thus, the 
voluntary program has effectively become mandatory in the 
marketplace. As such, manufacturers must make significant 
investment decisions to qualify products for the program just 
as they must invest products to comply with mandatory appliance 
efficiency standards.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;The Energy Star program for home appliances originally was 
administered by DOE so that critical coordination with 
appliance standards and test procedures could occur. However, 
in 2009, the program was transferred from DOE to EPA. The lack 
of expertise within EPA has led to complications with 
verification testing requirements and EPA officials began to 
broaden the scope of the program into non-energy related 
product requirements such as product performance and warranty 
terms. This expansion has added consideration confusion for 
manufacturers and diminishes the brand. Energy Star has drifted 
from its original mission and operates at many levels as it if 
were still an experimental program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Within 25 years from its creation, the Energy Star program 
is a full matured de facto mandatory federal program that needs 
additional statutory authorization to keep it focused and to 
create long-term stability and certainty. It must maintain its 
focus on its intended and sole purpose--energy efficiency. To 
address these concerns, AHAM proposes the following.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;First, move the Energy Star for home appliances from EPA 
back to DOE and provide funding for a reform program. I believe 
Secretary Perry was receptive to this suggestion when he 
appeared before this committee recently. While Energy Star can 
be transferred back to DOE administratively, and we support 
that, statutory requirement to house the program at DOE will 
keep it from becoming a ping pong ball. We respectfully suggest 
that the draft bill indicate that authority over the Energy 
Star program be held by DOE and except for home appliances 
covered under EPCA may be delegated to EPA as determined by the 
secretary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Secondly, we support the bill's revision to increase 
transparency and long-term certainty of the program by 
establishing administrative procedure process requirements. 
There should be a formal and transparent process for changing 
and developing Energy Star specifications for all stakeholders. 
The APA will not slow down the Energy Star processes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Finally, we support the draft bill's provision to stop 
Energy Star class action lawsuits that undercut fair 
enforcement by the federal government. Because Energy Star has 
its own remedies, allowing class actions undermines the program 
and fosters a system of double jeopardy for Energy Star 
partners. Congress should make clear it does not intend this 
program to be used for that purpose. Our members must earn the 
trust of consumers each and every day, as our products are so 
vital to their well-being.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;We look forward to working with the committee to improve 
the Energy Star processes and make the program stronger to 
deliver reliable energy efficiency tools to consumers 
purchasing home appliances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;On behalf of our industry, I'd like to thank the 
subcommittee for its work on this issue including this draft 
bill and I respectfully request that my written statement be 
included as part of the hearing record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF KATERI CALLAHAN&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="KATERI CALLAHAN"&gt;    The chair now calls upon Kateri Callahan, the President of 
the Alliance to Save Energy. I am sorry if I butchered that 
first name with that thick Texas drawl but----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Sir, you did it just right and a Kentucky
drawl appreciates that Texas drawl.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and members of the 
subcommittee. I have the pleasure of serving as the President 
of the Alliance to Save Energy, which is a nonprofit coalition 
comprised of over 130 different businesses and organizations 
and I would note that all the witnesses before you today are 
members of the Alliance to Save Energy's associate's program 
and our businesses represent about $870 billion in market cap.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;We were founded way back in 1977 by Senators Chuck Percy of 
Illinois and Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, and our bipartisan 
heritage had continued the 40 years since.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Today, we have 15 members of Congress who serve in an 
honorary capacity on our board representing both sides of the 
Capitol and both sides of the aisle and I am just honored and 
delighted that five members of this committee serve on the 
Alliance's honorary board including Dr. Burgess, Mr. Kinzinger, 
Mr. McKinley, Mr. Tonko, and Mr. Welch. We thank them for their 
support.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;The Alliance's history with the Energy Star program is 
long. We supported the creation of the program and we worked 
then with the Congress, with EPA, DOE, and all the Energy Star 
partners to keep the voluntary program both robust and 
impactful. For this reason, we very much appreciate and applaud 
the subcommittee members and staff for fully engaging all the 
key stakeholder groups as you seek to craft legislation that 
will impact this program. While we are open to continuing to 
improve the program, we have to caution the subcommittee to be 
very careful to assure that there are no unintended negative 
consequences as you consider changes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;As many have already mentioned and as detailed in my 
testimony and those of other businesses and organizations that 
are offering comment on the discussion draft, Energy Star today 
is a venerable program. It is widely recognized as the world's 
gold standard for public-private partnerships. More than 90 
percent of Americans recognize and trust that familiar blue 
label.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Energy cost savings to consumers have grown to over $430 
billion and we are still counting. The program has driven $165 
billion in private sector investment and new technology and 
innovation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Ten percent of the homes built today are built and proudly 
display the Energy Star label and over 50 percent of the 
commercial building floor space--50 percent--is using the 
Energy Star portfolio manager to monitor and control energy 
consumption. I think it was Mr. Pallone who mentioned this, but 
if the old adage ever stood true--if it ain't broke, don't fix 
it. That is the case with today's Energy Star program and it 
should be the test against which the subcommittee determines 
the content of any bill that will impact its future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Our greatest concerns with the discussion draft are 
twofold--the proposed wholesale move of the program from EPA to 
DOE, and the application of the Administrative Procedures Act, 
or APA. We oppose a wholesale move of the Energy Star program 
from EPA to DOE. As Joe said, such a shift in responsibility 
for parts of the programs can be done and the flexibility is 
there under current law for EPA and DOE to assign or reassign 
responsibilities to assure the most effective and streamlined 
management of the program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;So we encourage the stakeholders and the committee to look 
to the administration to move any parts that may make the most 
sense over and back and forth between the two agencies. We also 
oppose the broad application of the APA, which was designed and 
intended for regulatory programs that carry the force of law, 
not voluntary programs like the Energy Star.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;We do believe, however, that there should be adequate 
transparency and predictability to the specification-setting 
process for Energy Star products and we'd very much like to 
work with the agencies and the subcommittee to consider 
provisions that can accomplish this goal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;The Alliance appreciates the efforts made by the 
subcommittee to reduce costs for manufacturers that are in good 
standing to the program. But we do not support an exemption of 
third party certification for only certain manufacturers of 
consumer electronic devices. We stand ready to work with the 
subcommittee, EPA, and its partners to consider options that 
could lower certification costs for all manufacturers who are 
in good standing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Finally, the Alliance does support the discussion draft 
provision to explicitly put in a no-warranty clause to defend 
against class action suits. In our experience, the agencies 
have actively enforced specification compliance and have 
delisted products and assessed penalties in an appropriate 
fashion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;In conclusion, I would note, as other members of the 
committee have, that the subcommittee's deliberations are 
coming at a time when the Energy Star program is under threat 
of elimination by the administration and significant budget 
cuts by the Congress. We urge this subcommittee, therefore, to 
continue to work closely with all of us who support this gold 
standard public-private partnership and make sure that the 
program has the congressional support, it has the guidance, 
and, very importantly, it has the funding it needs to continue 
to deliver the enormous energy and dollar savings that American 
consumers and businesses have come to expect from the Energy 
Star label.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF GREG MERRITT&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="GREG MERRITT"&gt;    Our next witness is Mr. Greg Merritt. Greg is vice 
president at CREE. You have 5 minutes for an opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Thank you, and good morning. I'd like to thank
the committee, the chairman, and ranking member for the 
opportunity to speak to you today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;CREE is a U.S.-based developer and producer of advanced 
technology LEDs, LED lighting products, and power and wireless 
semiconductor components. We are headquartered in North 
Carolina and have facilities in Wisconsin, Arkansas, and 
California with over 6,000 employees worldwide. Our 
technologies, products, and solutions are all focused on 
advancing energy-efficient improvements across the lighting, 
communications, electric transportation, renewable energy, and 
energy storage industries. We helped to launch what we called 
the LED lighting revolution over 10 years ago and have 
witnessed firsthand the important role Energy Star has played 
in helping guide consumers to higher quality energy-efficient 
products driving adoption by facilitating rebates and incentive 
programs and providing a trusted brand among the confusion of 
new technologies and many unknown manufacturer which, by the 
way, included CREE in those early days.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Energy Star continues to be a trusted brand to consumers 
and a valued partner to suppliers like CREE. The program's 
remarkable success is undeniable, as you've heard earlier, and 
as a marketing executive I will tell you that there are many 
companies around the world that would envy the 90 percent brand 
recognition that Energy Star enjoys today. This brand is an 
incredibly valued asset and we should fiercely protect it. As a 
participating Energy Star company with over 400 Energy Star-
rated products, CREE is very supportive of changes that will 
improve the program and help secure its future but is also wary 
of those that may do otherwise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Our foremost interest, and I think you've heard this 
earlier, is to ensure that Energy Star is fully funded, retains 
its experience and capable staff and management, and continues 
to deliver multiple valued programs including product 
certification, commercial buildings, and homes. Furthermore, we 
would advocate specific authorization of funding to ensure that 
the appropriated levels going forward are adequate to keep the 
program strong and viable and at least match historical levels 
of funding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Among the proposals included in the discussion draft we are 
addressing today we are particularly concerned by the proposed 
transfer of the program to DOE and the proposal to apply the 
Administrative Procedures Act to the development of Energy Star 
specifications. We believe the wholesale transfer of the 
program to DOE threatens to severely disrupt funding, staffing, 
and operations, and while there are always improvements that 
can be made and we believe they could be made under the 
existing structure, we believe Energy Star is running smoothly 
and is well managed at EPA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;EPA has a talented team of professionals, years of 
institutional knowledge and experience, not to mention 
established and strong working relationships with 16,000 Energy 
Star partners. We are, therefore, opposed to moving Energy Star 
to DOE, an agency that does not have budget authority 
appropriations or staff who are trained and experienced in the 
critical marketing, brand management, and partnership aspects 
of this important program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;As for the proposal to apply the APA to Energy Star 
specifications, we are adamantly opposed. We believe this 
proposal would add unnecessary, time-consuming, and burdensome 
regulation and process to a voluntary program that by its very 
nature must be nimble, flexible, and responsive to rapidly-
changing products, technologies, and markets.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;We believe imposing APA will eliminate the ability of 
program staff to make quick adjustments to the specification 
that are necessary in response to technology evolution and the 
program will forever be chasing technology and market 
evolution, rendering it ineffective. I would also note that 
recent experience with Energy Star, at least by my company, has 
reflected improved engagement of product manufacturing and 
specification process, multiple rounds of comment and drafts, 
and many of these have been in response to our earlier requests 
to EPA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;We would also be opposed to providing exemptions for 
specific manufacturers or products from third party 
certification. Third party certification was added to the 
program to prevent bad actors from misusing the program with 
products that don't meet Energy Star standards, depriving 
consumers of their promised savings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;We believe allowing exemptions would create the opportunity 
for this bad behavior to happen. While external testing does 
create a longer process and adds some costs, we believe it is a 
necessary and worthwhile trade-off. The trustworthiness of the 
Energy Star certification and label is the most valuable 
attribute of the program and it should not be risked for 
convenience.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Finally, while we don't have a firm position on the 
warranty provision, we would oppose it if it is paired with 
exemptions from third party certification for the reasons I 
delineated above.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;The chair now calls upon Mr. Christopher Drew, the 
executive vice president and chief marketing and strategy 
officer for the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration 
Institute.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER DREW&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="CHRISTOPHER DREW"&gt;    You have 5 minutes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Drew&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Rush, and members of
the subcommittee, good morning, and thank you for the 
opportunity to testify here today on possible reforms to the 
Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;My name is Christopher Drew and I am the Executive Vice 
President for Burnham Holdings. I am also Chairman of the Air 
Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, an 
organization representing more than 320 manufacturers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Currently, our industry as a whole represents 1.3 million 
employees and generates $257 billion in economic activity. AHRI 
represents over 90 percent of the domestic HVACR and water 
heating industry and more than 70 percent of the global 
industry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Today, 160 AHRI members participate in the Energy Star 
program. I am pleased to say Burnham Holdings participates in 
the Energy Star program and has about a hundred products 
listed. From our experience, we have enjoyed a positive working 
relationship with the EPA and we would like the program to 
continue as a resource consumers can rely on and trust for 
information on the efficiency of the products they are 
considering for purchase.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;My comments as chairman of AHRI reflecting the concerns 
held by the HVACR manufacturers are covered in greater detail 
in the testimony submitted for the record. The industry's 
concerns are related to the approach taken to move the program, 
compliance burdens that should be addressed, as well as 
ensuring the program is able to continue as a valuable and 
informative tool for educating consumers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;AHRI and its members have concerns about the draft's 
suggestion to move the program from the EPA where it is 
currently housed to the Department of Energy. The industry 
would prefer to maintain the program as it currently stands at 
the EPA where it has been able to operate successfully for our 
products since 1992.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Though no doubt well intentioned, the draft does not 
provide details as to how moving the program could be 
accomplished without disruption. It is currently operated by a 
knowledgeable and dedicated staff in a way that generally 
ensures stakeholder input and successful outcomes. Furthermore, 
if moved, the draft language leaves much of the administration 
of the program to the discretion of the Secretary of Energy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Energy Star's credibility and success over the last 25 
years has been partially driven by its stability within the 
EPA's portfolio and the certainty it provides to consumers that 
what they are purchasing is government certified. There is no 
false advertising. Therefore, if the program is to be moved, 
which is not what our industry would prefer, we would like the 
committee to provide more details on how it will be managed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Reduced compliance burdens, the AHRI has also urged the 
federal government to recognize voluntary certification 
programs as a way to comply with federal energy efficiency 
standards and the Energy Star program. Relying on industry 
consensus certification programs reduces duplicative efforts 
between the federal government and industry, encourages 
compliance with energy efficiency regulations, reduces 
regulatory burdens, and saves taxpayer dollars, all while 
enhancing market surveillance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;AHRI is currently an EPA-designated certification body. 
This allows AHRI program participants to realize significant 
savings as they are able to meet Energy Star requirements 
without any additional testing on the products they wish to 
have labelled. The draft does include a promising improvement 
to allow for good actors--those participants have met all 
requirements of the program for a period of at least 18 months 
to be eligible for reduced compliance burdens. Unfortunately, 
the draft makes this available only to certain products. We 
believe this section should be broadened to include all 
products as a stated policy is to recognize those who are 
compliant with the program to prove themselves trustworthy, not 
based on a specific product type.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Additionally, while the Administrative Procedures Act is 
the most commonly used method of ensuring stakeholder input, 
Energy Star is not a regulatory process. It is a voluntary 
program and applying a full APA process could create an 
unnecessary burden for a program like Energy Star. Ensuring 
proper stakeholder input and notification could easily be 
achieved through agreeing on a process that is transparent and 
predictable without the burdens APA would place on the agency 
and participants.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Another area of concern for our industry, related to moving 
the program from EPA to DOE, is the potential disruption it 
might cause to highly successful and impactful Energy Star 
building programs like Portfolio Manager. Portfolio Manager is 
EPA's tool for building owners and managers to understand how 
their properties operate and how to improve their economic 
performance. Fifty percent of U.S. commercial floor space uses 
Portfolio Manager and it is also used by the commercial real 
estate industry to comply with the numerous state and local 
laws.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;In addition, under Energy Star's New Homes program, houses 
are designed and built with a system-wide approach in mind so 
that all energy efficiency systems and features work together 
to deliver better performance. Quality installation of these 
products is essential for consumers to gain the full benefits 
of their highly efficient equipment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Finally, sufficient funding for Energy Star is vital to the 
continued success of the program no matter where it resides 
within the federal government.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;I would like to thank the committee members and staff for 
being so inclusive of stakeholders and inviting comments on 
this discussion draft.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;We look forward to working with you to improve the Energy 
Star program and the regulatory environment for HVAC-R and 
water heating manufacturers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS JOHNSON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DOUGLAS JOHNSON"&gt;    Mr. Johnson, you have 5 minutes for an opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Vice Chairman Olson, Ranking Member Rush,
members of the subcommittee, on behalf of the Consumer 
Technology Association, thank you very much for the opportunity 
to provide feedback from our membership on how best to improve 
the Energy Star program. We thank the committee and Congressman 
Latta for their work on this discussion draft.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;CTA's membership includes 2,200 companies, 80 percent of 
which are small businesses and startups. CTA also owns and 
produces CS, the global stage for innovation in Las Vegas in 
January. A large number of our members are partners in the 
Energy Star program and some of them are award-winning 
partners. As of 2015, more than half of the electricity savings 
in the Energy Star products program came from electronics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Regarding energy efficiency policy, we advocate for 
approaches that are national, voluntary, market oriented, 
globally harmonized, flexible, collaborative, and friendly to 
innovation and economic growth. Most recently our efforts have 
included groundbreaking industry-led voluntary agreements for 
energy efficiency in set-top boxes and small network equipment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;This is a great time to identify and pursue regulatory 
reform opportunities related to energy efficiency programs. 
Based on our members' experience with the Energy Star program, 
we have six recommendations we'd like to make regarding the 
discussion draft.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;First, we support the balanced and bipartisan solution to 
third party certification that is part of the discussion draft 
bill. This solution maintains Energy Star third party 
certification authority but allows electronics manufacturers 
with a demonstrated track record of compliance to earn their 
way out of the burdensome requirement. If there is 
noncompliance, then the more draconian costly third party 
certification requirements reapply. It is important to keep in 
mind that the rigorous post-market verification system that 
exists today would stay in place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Second, regarding moving program leadership to DOE, we know 
our members' experience with EPA and Energy Star has been 
collaborative in some categories and less so in others.If 
program leadership were to move to DOE, which is used to 
traditional regulatory rulemakings, we would need assurances 
that DOE would work collaboratively in partnership with 
industry in the voluntary Energy Star program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Third, regarding application of the APA to Energy Star, our 
view is that some changes are needed to ensure Energy Star 
program transparency and accountability. Something elective and 
less restrictive than full-blown application of the APA may be 
best since we want to avoid encumbering the program and 
undermining its ability to keep pace with the tech industry. 
But APA could apply in some measure to ensure due process, 
transparency, and rational decision making in the 
administration of the program and the development of product 
specifications. Increasing Energy Star program transparency and 
accountability also could include a review of program decisions 
by the Office of Management and Budget.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Our fourth recommendation concerns the provision about 
application of Energy Star to products of various sizes and 
capabilities. A few years ago, EPA decided it could impose a 
cutoff based on product size for participation in the program. 
We think Energy Star's specification should be scalable, giving 
models across the board no matter size and performance 
something realistic to shoot for and giving consumers an Energy 
Star option across the board as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Our last two points concern topics not addressed in the 
discussion draft but relevant to the Energy Star program and 
its administration. At times over the years the EPA has 
attempted to broaden the scope of Energy Star to cover non-
energy factors such as greenhouse gas emissions of 
manufacturing processes and supply chains not related to the 
energy efficiency of the product itself. This Energy Star 
mission creep has appeared in past EPA proposals for new Energy 
Star specifications for computers, displays, and televisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;We think Energy Star should stay focused on energy 
efficiency. Our final point concerns standard test procedures 
on which Energy Star and other programs depend. DOE and EPA 
have hired consultants to develop test procedures for measuring 
the power consumption of products being considered for Energy 
Star specifications and, if applicable, DOE standards. This use 
of consultants is not only costly but also less transparent 
than the open private sector's consensus standards development 
process. We think Energy Star program administrators should 
rely on these existing and less costly opportunities already 
developed by the private sector.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;In conclusion, I would reiterate that this committee's 
focus on Energy Star reform and improvement opportunities is 
important and necessary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

views and ideas and we look forward to further engagement with

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Johnson "&gt;    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Johnson, and I thank all of you
for your testimony, and now the fun begins.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;We'll move into member question and answers, 5 minutes per 
member. I will begin by recognizing myself for 5 minutes, and 
my first question is for you, Mr. Johnson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;One of the provisions this bill changes is third party 
verification rules in Energy Star. It creates exemptions for 
electronics manufacturers that are in good standing with the 
program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    Can you go into some detail on why this is important and 
how we can make sure companies don't abuse this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;There are three thoughts along this line that
I have. One is why just electronics, as was mentioned earlier, 
and the Energy Star program covers something like 60 different 
product categories across various industry sectors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;We are rather unique in the sense that we have extremely 
competitive time to market pressures in this industry, product 
life cycles that may only be a few months long, and to take the 
time and the cost at the pre-market stage to test products is a 
particular burden in the case of our sector.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;The second point I'd like to make is the track record of 
industry performance under Energy Star. Our industry has an 
excellent track record of compliance in the program. EPA 
acknowledged that several years ago when they imposed third 
party certification on everybody in order to tackle discrete 
problems that could have been tackled in a discrete way. But 
the blanket went over everybody and we were covered as well and 
have been ever since. I think a tailored approach would have 
been better, but what we are talking about here is a balanced 
approach to let the good actors earn their way out of the 
burden and if they mess up then they're back in for, as the 
language says, at least three years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;The third point I'd like to make is that post-market 
verification stays in place and that's really important. That's 
testing products off the store shelf to make sure that they 
adhere to the requirements of the Energy Star program. We don't 
touch that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    So I think that the tailored and balanced approach we are 
looking for is in this discussion draft. It is also reflected 
in the Senate and has been for the past couple Congresses. So 
we are happy to see it here and we look forward to supporting 
it as it advances.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;And more fun for you, Mr. Johnson. I know that
one controversial issue is class action lawsuits in the Energy 
Star program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    Can you give an example of how one of your members was 
impacted by a class action lawsuit and whether you think that 
lawsuit was appropriate? No names. Just one member.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Sure. Actually, this question may be best
directed to another witness. This is a provision that we are 
not agnostic about in the sense of understanding what it's 
trying to accomplish and that it would cover actually all 
sectors in the program. But this is not part of the discussion 
draft that we are particularly advocating.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Other witnesses may have a different view.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt; I was going to say, that witness is Mr. Drew.
Any comments, sir, about how was one of your members impacted 
by a class action lawsuit and whether you think that was 
appropriate. And no names. But just has this happened. I 
suspect it has but an example of how this has gotten out of 
whack with class action lawsuits.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Drew&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt; I admit, I am not familiar that any of our
members have been caught up in a class action lawsuit specific 
to Energy Star at this point in time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;OK. Another question for--well, the first one
for Mr. McGuire.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;In your testimony about EPA and Energy Star, you mentioned 
the problem of mission creep and Mr. Johnson mentioned mission 
creep and some examples are climate change and other sorts of 
focuses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    Energy Star's primary purpose is to help consumers save 
money on energy bills by identifying those products that go 
above and beyond mandatory efficiency standards. Give some 
examples like Mr. Johnson did about climate change about 
mission creep happening under Energy Star. Any example of 
mission creep?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;There have been instances where the EPA has
added performance requirements to the Energy Star 
specifications. In the case of dishwashers, they wanted to not 
only control the energy and the energy used to heat water but 
how the product would perform, and they have done that in the 
case of clothes dryers too and have attempted to do that in 
other products. They also, in the case of clothes dryers, 
wanted to include requirements for warranty terms.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;So our view is that the law that underpins the appliance 
standards program itself requires that maximum energy is saved, 
its cost effect to the consumer, and the requirement does not 
jeopardize the product's functionality and performance. That's 
what is left up to the manufacturer dealing with the customers. 
They want to compete on performance and quality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    This is not an area for the government to be laying on top 
of the energy efficiency requirements. So we've experienced it 
firsthand since the program was moved to EPA.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt; Sorry, sir. I missed you at first. Any example
of class action lawsuit for your members that's happened 
because of overreach of the Energy Star program?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;The Energy Star program has a very robust
penalty system to it where partners can be eliminated from the 
program. They can be required to pay compensation to consumers 
if the energy efficiency requirement was incorrect, and this is 
all put on the Energy Star website.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    It is very visible to consumers, to retailers. The penalty 
is fit to the infraction. Having a class action lawsuit on top 
of that is another layer of penalty that is totally unnecessary 
and is not going to make the company--the partner, if you 
will--change its behavior because it's already doing that with 
regard to the penalty requirements of the program. It is double 
jeopardy.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt; Thank you, sir. I am 50 seconds over so I
recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee for 5 minutes 
and 50 seconds. Mr. Rush.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rush&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Ms. Callahan, as stated previously the Energy Star program 
is one of the more popular and trusted programs that's out 
there and also is a voluntary program. So this bill that we are 
considering is not only unnecessary but it would also turn a 
good program into a bad program and I oppose disrupting this 
program by moving it from EPA to DOE. I am opposed to making 
this voluntary program to APA. I oppose undermining the 
integrity of the program by limiting accountability for 
manufacturers and I oppose revising the third party 
certification requirements that lead to fraud and abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;    That said, Ms. Callahan, in your opinion, if this bill were 
to become law and these changes to Energy Star were to go into 
effect, how would this impact the integrity of the overall 
Energy Star program and how would it impact consumers' 
confidence in the program?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Thank you for your question, Mr. Rush.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;I think our concern as an energy efficiency organization is 
if this discussion draft as it's currently crafted were written 
into law, that it would have very, very significant damaging 
consequences on the program and on consumers' ability to have 
confidence in that program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;You mentioned several things that we are very concerned 
with. One is a wholesale movement of the program for EPA over 
to DOE. Some of my fellow witnesses have talked about this as 
well as members that there's 25 years of history of brand 
management, of partnership relations, of IT and databases that 
have been built that won't be easily moved. And there is not 
appropriations at DOE to support that size of program. It is 
about $42 million at EPA currently. There is not the expertise 
and the staff that is there to do the brand management and the 
marketing and we are very concerned that the program, even for 
the period of time to dismantle an infrastructure and rebuild 
it over in another agency will take away from the focus on the 
program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;    So we are very, very concerned. With respect to 
certification, third party certification resulted from a GAO 
study that found that there were folks that were not self-
certifying appropriately and were basically cheating the 
system. So there are very good reasons for putting in that 
third party certification. We are open to looking at ways to 
minimize burdens and costs on manufacturers but we have to 
protect the integrity of the program. If consumers cannot rely 
on that blue label to indicate that there are energy savings in 
that product as top of the market then we really lose what we 
have and what we have built over 25 years.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rush&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;    I want to move to Mr. Merritt. Mr. Merritt, Energy Star is 
a completely voluntary program but yet the legislation full 
force will apply the APA specification to the program. What 
impact would that have on the Energy Star program overall and 
on your industry specifically?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Thank you for the question, Mr. Rush.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;So as I mentioned in my testimony, the application of APA, 
we believe, would limit the ability of the program to be nimble 
and responsive to changes in technology and the market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Currently, the Energy Star program is able to make what we 
will refer to as tweaks and specification based on developments 
in the market without going through a long process of formal 
notification, comment period, posting, et cetera.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;We believe the current structure of the program allows the 
program to work effectively with partners and participating 
vendors to revise these specifications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    We are concerned about making the process so long and 
burdensome that we are unable to keep up with the changes in 
the market and the technology.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rush&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;Ms. Callahan, as you know, the president's FY
2018 budget zeroes out the Energy Star program. But a proposal 
put forward by the majority would enact major cuts to it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt;    Currently, the program is operating at $42 million pursuant 
to the most recent continuing resolution. What level of funding 
do you think is appropriate for the Energy Star program to 
effectively operate at and what type of return will we see if 
Congress funded the program at its optimal level?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Thank you again for the question, Mr. Rush.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;As you mentioned, the current appropriations are about $42 
million over at EPA and DOE also contributes funding for some 
of specification and the technical work that they do to support 
EPA. We believe that that funding is insufficient to continue 
the program and to look at including more products, more 
different ranges and sizes of products.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;We've suggested in our testimony an authorization level and 
appropriation levels of up to $75 million. Historic levels for 
the program have been $50 million but that's historic, and 
there has been increase in funding for the 14 years that I have 
been at the Alliance to Save Energy. It has been, roughly, 
stable to falling and we believe that there have been 
increases, of course, in cost of living and programs going 
forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;So we believe that this program should grow and should have 
more funding than it does and have direction from the Congress 
for what those levels should be, which is not currently there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;The other thing that I would add to that is on the return. 
I think the EPA studies show that for every dollar invested 
there are about $4.50 in energy savings that are realized, and 
as I mentioned in my oral statement, this little program that 
could at $42 million a year has driven $165 billion in private 
sector investment in new technology and innovation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;    So I think dollars here are very well spent and it's penny 
wise and pound foolish to continue to decline the funding when 
really it should go the other way.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rush&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Rush"&gt; I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the pride of Ennis, Texas, the 
vice chairman of the full committee, Mr. Barton, for 5 minutes 
of questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You're in fine form
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;I appreciate this hearing and the witnesses being here. I 
want to make sure I am clear on this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Mr. McGuire, this is a voluntary program, right? 
Manufacturers don't have to participate if they don't want to. 
Isn't that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;It is a voluntary program. However, over its
21 years in existence for home appliances it has become in 
effect mandatory in the marketplace. Utility rebate programs 
specified, building code specified, federal procurement 
specifies it, and many retailers will not carry your products 
if you don't have Energy Star.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;So while it is voluntary, manufacturers have to have Energy 
Star products and what we are saying may be different from the 
rest is appliances began their Energy Star career at DOE. The 
very reason that the test procedures that allow manufacturers 
to test a product to see how much energy it uses are changing 
all the time because of technology. And so those test 
procedures are needed to determine if you meet Energy Star 
requirements. When it went to EPA and they began experimenting 
with performance and warranty terms and other non-energy 
features, that's where disruption and confusion occurred.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    So Energy Star has been great for consumers. We just want 
it to be stable and provide certainty so that our companies can 
comply with it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;All I really needed was a yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    I got a lot more than I bargained for. Let me go to part 
two of the question. The reason I wanted to get on the record 
explicitly that it was voluntary is because I don't think you 
need to have a voluntary program subject to class action 
lawsuits. Do you agree with that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; I do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; OK. That's a----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; That would be yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;That's a good answer. All right. And I will
come back to you one more time. The draft discussion draft 
makes the Department of Energy the primary agency and it, to 
some extent, redefines the responsibilities of the Department 
of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;I happen to believe, and this will surprise my friends on 
the Democratic side, that we need a strong enforcement 
capability at EPA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    But I think EPA should focus on enforcement and not on 
setting policy, and as you pointed out, EPA more and more has 
used the role under the current system to move into policy 
areas that they really don't have a, in my opinion, a 
legitimate reason to move into. Would you agree with that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; I would, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Good. So you're getting better at it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; I am coachable.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; If we were starting over and we had never had
an Energy Star program and we created an Energy Star program, 
why would you not make the Department of Energy the standard 
setter and EPA the enforcement oversight? Why wouldn't you do 
that? What's wrong with that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Well, that's the way it did begin, and that
made total sense because of the technical nature of the 
standards and the test procedures. And all the verification 
testing that's done for Energy Star today is overseen by DOE 
because of the complicated nature.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    We do the verification testing. So it made total sense to 
have it there at the beginning. It makes total sense to have it 
there now, for consumers and for manufacturers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; I will go to Mr. Johnson for my last question.
How long does it take to go through the system and get a 
product certified for Energy Star right now under the current 
system?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Our members report that it can take a few days or a couple 
of weeks. But, again, for an industry whose product life cycles 
are relatively short and measured in months, that's a 
significant amount of time to be off the store shelf.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Is there anybody that would state under the
current system it takes an excessive amount of time to get 
certified? Anybody?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    So in terms of actually submitting your product for review, 
once you do it, the Department of Energy and the EPA act 
expeditiously. Is that a fair statement? Not a fair statement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;If I may, I think once you are certified there
are steps after that take less time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;But it is the time out of the product development cycle to 
send your product to a third party to have it tested, 
information to be sent to another and back to EPA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    It takes a while and, certainly, in contrast to self-
certification, which, again, worked for us quite well for many 
years under Energy Star and in other regulatory arenas. It is a 
relative burden.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon a gentleman who doesn't share Mr. 
Rush--my admiration for the Houston Astros' victory, the man 
from California, home of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Mr. McNerney, 
for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;OK. You're right, I don't. But we can move on
from that, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;    I thank the witnesses and I thank the chairman this 
morning. Mr. Johnson, what determines an adequate track record 
for companies on the Energy Star program and who should 
determine this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;When we talk about third party certification
improvement, I would stress that we are not talking about 
eviscerating the EPA's capability to have this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I think it was important for EPA to recognize, and they 
did, when they instituted third party certification that we had 
an excellent track record and we've maintained that after third 
party certification as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;The problem we are trying to avoid is the burden that is 
too much for a company that wants to maybe put a product on the 
market that qualifies for Energy Star but doesn't want to take 
the time and cost involved with testing. So we've heard 
feedback from our manufacturer members who tell us that they 
may not want to pay the bill or take the time. They'll just 
meet the spec and get the product to market. So we end up with 
the store shelf where you have Energy Star labelled products 
and products that meet the Energy Star spec but don't have a 
label because they didn't want to take the time and I don't 
think that's very good for the program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    And we would still support EPA oversight, obviously, and in 
the case of companies that violate and they would, of course, 
be subject to the requirements of third party certification 
once again. So I think, if anything, we have weighted this in 
this language toward penalty. But I think the track record 
speaks for itself in this industry. We were not the problems 
that they were trying to address when they instituted this and 
we would sure welcome a good actor's opportunity to earn our 
way out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;    Ms. Callahan, the 2008 memorandum of understanding between 
the DOE and the EPA helped the program. Is there any room for 
improvement on that MOU?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;I think that it's a good thing to go back and
review the memorandum of understanding regularly and it's my 
understanding that EPA and DOE are in discussions now about 
that MOU and changes that may be made. Current law gives them 
the ability, just as it did to put in force that MOU in 2008--I 
think it was 2009, actually.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;They can rewrite that and change and move around elements 
of the program to make it most streamlined and most cost 
effective. So we are encouraging stakeholders, and this is in 
my testimony, to work with the agencies to seek improvements to 
the program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;    We are not convinced as the Alliance to Save Energy that it 
takes a statutory change. We believe that the program can be 
improved and that the agencies are motivated to improve the 
program. So we would like to see it happen there first.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; Well, we don't have the agencies in front of
us today. But you're saying that there may be a new MOU in the 
works?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; I said they are in discussions about ways to
improve the program, sir. I wouldn't want to overstate. I have 
had no conversation to indicate that they are looking at and 
rewriting the MOU.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; So how would you go about increasing the
predictability in Energy Star specification settings, as you've 
suggested?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;I think working with the stakeholders and
with EPA and DOE to look at best practices and maybe 
regularizing time frames between product specifications in a 
way that makes sense. I think it's a bit tricky. As Doug 
Johnson has indicated, some of these products are changing so 
dramatically the technology in the marketplace.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;    So I think we have to preserve the flexibility and that's 
working with the agencies and with the program administrators 
and putting in place some best practices and guidelines, to me, 
makes a lot more sense to keep that program flexible and nimble 
rather than trying to codify something into law.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;    Mr. McGuire, you seem to be the only one that is favorable 
toward moving this back to the DOE. How would you address the 
concerns of the other panelists that that would be disruptive 
of a very successful program?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Well, I am also the only one representing an
industry sector whose life at Energy Star began at DOE. All the 
other products started at EPA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;So what I am saying is that there was disruption when our 
appliances were moved to EPA in 2009--and some of the examples 
I cited with that--created diversions and inefficiencies. I 
think they should be back at DOE where they can be tied more to 
the standards and test procedures work and make it more 
predictable for our members and for the customers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    And so this can be done administratively, as Kateri 
indicated, through a change to the memorandum of understanding. 
We would support the memorandum being changed to bring home 
appliances back to DOE. We would all support----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; You're just saying bring the home appliances,
not the whole program, back to the DOE?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; I am speaking only for home appliances. We
believe they should be back at DOE. I am not speaking for the 
other products of the other industries.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; Right. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman's time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the gentleman from the land of 
Lincoln, Mr. Shimkus, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is great to be
with you all. I may be the fly in the ointment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;I have always struggled with the Energy Star issue. First 
of all, I think the budget is, I was told, $50 million. It has 
been cut to $41 million, and the president proposes zero.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    And Ms. Callahan, you think it should be $75 million.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Up to.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;So then it's really a fundamental debate about
government and kind of government's role and manufacturing and 
consumer choices and education. So that's why I always struggle 
with it. Yes, I understand that eventually consumers will get a 
lower cost but there's a lot of gaming of the system that I 
don't like.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    I don't like the fact--and you can disagree--building new 
homes today costs more because of these standards. Would anyone 
disagree with that? If you're going to purchase a new home, 
that cost of that home is more expensive based upon efficiency 
standards.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Can I respond to that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt; Yes, quickly. But I----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; OK. Well, studies have shown that there is an
incremental cost----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;Correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    Ms. Callahan [continuing]. In terms of the mortgage, 
reduction in the payment of the energy costs applied to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;OK. That gets me to my other point.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;Then I don't like the ROI--return on investment of 20 or 30 
years from the supposed energy savings that really makes that 
initial purchase somewhat affordable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;What will be the debate. How much energy do you save--how 
much money do you save. So you're willing to take the initial 
upfront cost. And then my problem is what's government doing--
why is government involved with this to begin with. Why isn't 
it buyers and manufacturers?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;So has anyone heard of the National Institute for 
Automotive Service Excellence? Anyone know what that is?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;All right. So ASE--when you see ads, when you go to get 
your car repaired, you want to go to an ASE-certified 
mechanic--or at least that's what this institute says--because 
what? They're trained.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;Now, the ASE is short for the National Institute for 
Automotive Service Excellence. Since 1972, our independent 
nonprofit organization has worked to improve the quality of 
vehicle repair and service by testing and certifying automotive 
professionals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;Why does government have to do energy? Why can't we have a 
National Institute for Energy Efficiency, funded by you all, to 
certify and to advertise? We'll even give you the label if you 
want.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    Why is it government's role to do this? Anyone want to 
answer that question? Mr. McGuire.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Well, our members probably agree with you
philosophically but we have gone through decades of energy 
efficiency policy at the national level that has resulted in 
significant energy savings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    The dilemma is that if we were to wipe that federal program 
away, including Energy Star, you would have a patchwork of 
regulations throughout the country which we experienced in the 
1980s. So----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;So let me just--so, like, California may
continue to go a certain route. Not picking on my Californians. 
They're very all into this, right?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;And because there is such a huge market they may drive the 
rest of the country to move in that direction based upon the 
state standards, where if another state may not be.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;The other issue I have is when the median income of your 
district is $47,000 and they want to buy a home appliance and 
that home appliance is now disproportionately increased for two 
things--one is the efficiency standards, the other one is what 
Mr. Johnson was talking about, I think, and this is that DOE/
EPA debate is if you start putting other new concerns in the 
standardization and your testing, you're just going to increase 
the costs of the goods.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;So a short story. Many people know I own a townhouse. I 
have renters, and I had to get a new washer. I bought the 
cheapest washer I could buy and that's what we are using 
because I wasn't willing to pay--and I paid probably $2,400 
less than if I would have bought the top of the line energy 
super efficient save-the-world piece of equipment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;So I am worried about the people who can't afford these 
government standards, which I don't think are needed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    And I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt; Gentleman's time is expired. The chair now calls
upon a gentleman from California who is not happy again that my 
Astros won the World Series over his Dodgers, Mr. Peters, has 5 
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt; First of all, that is a total misread. You
cannot call a San Diegan a Dodger fan without their permission. 
I think you've misread this one, Mr. Chairman, and this is 
something on which we should be able to agree on actually.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt; I stand corrected.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;To respond to Mr. Shimkus, I actually think
this is about the least intrusive way for government to promote 
energy efficiency by sort of setting the table for consumers to 
have the information that they need to make a decision about 
whether they want to invest in energy efficiency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;And Mr. Shimkus decided on his own--nobody required him to 
buy a fancy washer machine. But you had the information to make 
that choice yourself.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;I think it's actually very valuable and nonintrusive. So my 
question goes to that, though, which is about the 
certification.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;    And Mr. Johnson, I got to read over your testimony and you 
said that in 2011 they switched to this self-certification. We 
don't have the agency here. Can you tell me if, if they were 
sitting here, why they would explain that they did that in 
2011, to switch away from self-certification?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; Sure. As----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt; Mandated a third party certification regime for
products.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Right. As Kateri Callahan referenced earlier,
EPA around that time was dealing with a couple of challenges or 
issues with the program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;One had to do with the database that was used at the time 
to administer the list of Energy Star qualified products and 
that database essentially was fooled by a third party audit 
that uploaded the famous gas-powered alarm clocks, right. So it 
was an egregious and well-publicized situation with the 
database on the administrative side of the program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;The other challenge, as I understand, had to do with a 
product category outside of our industry in the refrigerator 
category. Perhaps Mr. McGuire can shed further light than I 
can.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    But in any case, it was a discrete issue in a category of 
product outside of our industry. The response by EPA was very 
public and very broad and the blanket of third party 
certification went over everybody even though at the time in 
their press release EPA acknowledged that electronics had this 
100 percent track record of compliance.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt; Let me ask you, though, about--so what would
you do in the case of fraud? So let's just say that there's 
no--that self-certification, someone pats themselves on the 
back for meeting a spec that they don't in fact meet.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; So I think the penalties should be there.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt; What would be the penalty?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; In the language in the discussion draft or----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt; In your mind, what would be the right thing?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; Well, I think we favor the approach that's in
this discussion draft, which on one hand allows the good actors 
to earn their way out but if there's a screw up I think in at 
least two instances then they are back under third party 
certification for at least 3 years. So I think----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt; So there's no penalty to them for all the
products that they sold potentially fraudulently? In other 
words, just next time you have to have a certification, is that 
the way you'd advocate it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Well, in terms of allowing focus on the new
market entrants or the bad actors, I think that's really 
important. But for the good actors who've had that demonstrated 
track record of compliance, allow them to earn their way out.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    I think EPA will or DOE would maintain the oversight of the 
program and essentially kick the parties out that would 
violate. I think there's also the consumer response as well and 
there are a lot of publications and other parties that watch 
this space and please note that the manufacturers have equity 
in this brand as well. It is a partnership, fundamentally.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;I am very sympathetic, actually, particularly
in your industry where things turn over so fast. My concern is 
that without the certification, and I am not trying to answer 
the question--I am trying to ask it--without certification, as 
we go forward with this draft, how can we be confident that the 
standards will actually have been met? And I guess that's what 
I'd look at, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;For myself, I also don't understand why this is not an 
Energy Department program. It does seem to me that is where the 
expertise relies. I don't have an objection to that part of the 
bill. I am not sure why EPA is the better one to set standards 
than the Department of Energy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt;    But I am--I just--with the limited amount of time I have I 
just express the concern I have about compliance and not that I 
am an advocate for litigation but if you left the third party 
certification out there why you wouldn't want to have some sort 
of hammer, I don't know. Do you want to respond to that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; Yes, sir. The other note I wanted to make was
with respect to marketplace verification postmark. When the 
products are on the store shelves, labelled as Energy Star, 
very important to keep that going and the solution to third 
party certification, which is a premarket exercise, is distinct 
and separate from post-market verification. So that would be 
the random testing of products on store shelves.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt; And I think there would have to be some sort of
penalties in place for actual fraud.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; There are penalties. The EPA----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Peters&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Peters"&gt; I am out of time, ma'am. So I am sure maybe
someone else can ask you. Thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the author of the Energy Star 
Reform Act of 2017, Mr. Latta from Ohio, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again, thanks to
our panelists. I think it's a really good discussion that we're 
having and that's why we are here today to talk about this 
discussion draft.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;    And Mr. Drew, if I could just start with you. I think that 
everyone here believes that the Energy Star program is 
something that needs to be preserved. But the question is how 
can we improve upon it. And so my question to you was what 
improvements would you see or want to do to Energy Star to make 
it a better program for the consumer across this country?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Drew&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Thank you, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;In general, the products that are covered by AHRI are all 
highly regulated. They're certified to not only performance 
standards, they're also certified to numerous safety standards 
just due to the nature of the piece of equipment that we are 
manufacturing and then having installed in people's homes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;The Energy Star program as it stands we believe is a useful 
tool for educating consumers but products that they don't buy 
very often during their tenure as even homeowners or even if 
they're renters or building owners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;We find that the processes that we have in place to report 
the status of these products to Energy Star works extremely 
well at this point in time. Not burdening them further with any 
additional requirements for reporting, we believe, would be 
beneficial. The energy savings that we provide through our 
products from a high efficiency perspective, as stated earlier, 
is a consumer choice. We believe it provides real value to the 
consumer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;The fact that numerous third party organizations, not 
necessarily government-affiliated are providing incentives to 
purchase these products we also view as a significant benefit 
to our industry as well as the validation that moving towards 
higher efficiency equipment and achieving some reasonable 
return on that investment is a positive thing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;Regarding this discussion, again, we believe strongly that 
not moving it away from the EPA is the appropriate thing to do. 
It has been in EPA for a number of years--works very well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt;    We deal with other issues at DOE. We like the separation 
between EPA and DOE as it pertains to this particular program.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Mr. Johnson, I saw in your testimony some of the 
manufacturers have said that EPA have made it more difficult 
for the larger versions of some of their products for 
qualifying for Energy Star. One of the examples that you cite 
in your testimony is wide screen televisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;    Can you explain how EPA is making it difficult for the 
larger versions to qualify for Energy Star and carry the Energy 
Star label?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Sure. From the EPA's perspective, I think they
were concerned about a program all about energy efficiency 
applying to large products that would use more energy than 
small products.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;But our feeling was that if you're going to put a bogey out 
there--if you're going to put a specification out there for the 
market to shoot for, don't you want manufacturers up and down 
the product line, no matter the size of the product that 
consumers want, to strive for that specification?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;So yes, this artificial cap or cut off for televisions in 
an earlier television spec came up. I forget the exact numbers 
but it was something like, say, a 50-inch TV. All TVs above 
that would have to still meet that 50-inch TV spec even if they 
were 70 inches.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;So it was rather unachievable because, the bigger the 
product the more energy. But there should still have been a 
scalable specification for those larger TVs to shoot for.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    And, again, consumers demand what they demand. We love 
Energy Star. We think it should provide a scalable spec up and 
down the product line.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;    Mr. McGuire, I'd like to go back and revisit the warranty 
language and its importance. Can you expand on that warranty 
language and why it's so important?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; Warranty language in the draft bill?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt; Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Well, we think it's a great provision which would take 
manufacturers, Energy Star partners out of double jeopardy. As 
has been said already here today, when partners are 
disqualified for a particular product, have a rating that 
doesn't qualify, there are significant penalties that they pay 
in terms of being pulled out of the program for a period of 
time, restitution to consumers for utility costs that should 
have been avoided.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;This is all made very, very public and that's why these 
partners take it very, very seriously. To be exposed to a class 
action litigation on top of that, just additional punitive 
damages to the company really doesn't do anything as far as the 
behavior of the company.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    It is simply a double jeopardy and it can actually 
disincentive companies to want to participate in the Energy 
Star program. So we think the penalty portion of the program of 
enforcement makes sense. There's no need to lop on top of that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt; OK. Thank you very much and my time has expired
and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman's time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the biggest fan of the Houston 
Astros--we are the world champions--except for me in Congress, 
Mr. Green from Houston, Texas, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman--you and ranking member
for having this hearing. For more than 20 years, Energy Star 
program has formed a foundation for energy savings and 
assistance for Americans of all economic statuses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Energy Star program has resulted in millions of dollars of 
kilowatts saved through the highly efficient appliance 
manufacturing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Unlike my good friend from Illinois, I think the Energy 
Star program is probably one of the best programs that we have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Over the years, we have realized in this committee that 
energy efficiency is really an important issue and to have a 
regulation like we have that's a self-regulation we just want 
the manufacturers to be accurate in what they say the energy 
will be used.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;And the consumers pick it up. I think it should be if not a 
goal of the national government to give that information to 
folks but also use that energy efficiency so we may not have to 
build another electricity-generating plant.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;So because I know my colleague from Illinois--maybe it's 
because even in Texas our energy prices are fairly low right 
now. But I would probably not go by the lowest price because I 
look at that and see how much I can save over the life of this 
refrigerator, for this washer and drier or whatever. But it is 
a voluntary program. That's why I think this is a good example 
of it, and transferring it to the Department of Energy I think 
is reasonable because it fits in with what the Department of 
Energy ought to be doing. And EPA is a regulatory agency but 
they should be regulating my dishwater or whatever.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;The third party certification for Energy Star programs is 
initiated after that GAO report and I think that's such a 
greater improvement in the program. I'd like to believe 
companies do the right thing but--in compliance in this space 
but it's not always been the case.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;My first question to the entire panel, how did we strike a 
balance when it comes to self-certification in the consumer 
electronics space where we don't inhibit innovation under the 
Energy Star program but also make sure the benchmarks that are 
required are being met?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;    I know that's a tough one because how do you balance it? 
Does any of the panel have--let me start with you, Mr. McGuire.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Well, I won't speak for consumer electronics
but I will simply say that to meet a DOE energy efficiency 
standard--the mandatory standard, which is the base and Energy 
Star is above that--manufacturers have to self-certify to DOE 
in a very prescribed testing method that they have to provide 
all the data to DOE to prove that there's a reasonable chance 
they will be in compliance and then DOE does verification 
surveillance testing on top of that. So self-certification, 
government verification testing after market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    For Energy Star, it's third party testing up front and 
verification. One way you can make the program more efficient 
would be to tie it more in with DOE for home appliances so that 
the certification to meet the standard and to meet Energy Star 
was the same process and then you'd have third party 
verification. That would be one way to do it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt; Any other suggestions?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;I guess what I would say to that is that
there has to be a balance. You mentioned yourself you need 
consumer protection. They need to have confidence in this. So 
third party certification was put in place by EPA in response 
to manufacturers not being in compliance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;I think what's really important here are the penalties that 
accrue that Joe McGuire indicated earlier. So EPA can delist 
products and they can require companies to make restitution to 
consumers who didn't realize the energy savings that were 
promised to then.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;    So I think as the committee looks at it, making sure that 
those protections remain while we lower cost of compliance for 
manufacturers is really the trick and the balance that needs to 
be made there. But we need that accurate certification because 
consumers need to be able to count on the energy savings that 
they assume come with that Energy Star label.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt; Anyone else?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;We agree with the idea of balance but balance is actually 
reflected in this provision that's in this discussion draft 
concerning third party certification.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;We think it's a great solution. Again, EPA retains the 
third party certification authority, or DOE, should it move. 
But the program administrators retain that authority. We are 
just talking about balancing a solution here, essentially, 
targeting resources where they should be targeted, to new 
market entrants or bad actors. But if a good actor has 
demonstrated compliance for a period of time, why not let that 
good actor earn its way out? And, again, penalize that good 
actor should that good actor screw up a couple of times--
they're back in.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    So I think that's the kind of balance we need here and 
especially in the era of limited resources or perhaps smaller 
budgets. Let's hone in on what the problems are. Let's 
recognize where the problems are not.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know I am out of
time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;My friend's time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the gentleman from the Magnolia 
State, Mr. Harper, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to
each of you for being here and giving us your insight and 
assistance as we look at this discussion draft.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And Mr. Johnson, I have got a few questions and things I 
want to cover with you, if I can. The discussion draft contains 
provisions providing for an exemption from the third party 
certification requirements for electronic manufacturers in good 
standing with the Energy Star program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    I know we touched on it but give us a short background on 
why these third party certification requirements came into 
being and why you may think they have maybe gone too far.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Sure. They came into being 6 or so years ago--
6 or 7 years ago in response to discrete problems in the Energy 
Star program outside of our sector. One set of problems related 
to the way the program was being administered in the database.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;There was an opportunity certainly at that time to have a 
targeted approach to dealing with those problems but the 
easiest approach, the quickest way out was to apply premarket 
third party certification to everybody in the program. So we've 
lived under that regime since that time. All we are talking 
about here is a balanced way to earn your way out of that 
burden and I think that's the right way to go.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    It is also interesting to note that at the time EPA was 
proposing third party certification for Energy Star the 
European Commission, a major partner in the program over in 
Europe, was like-minded with industry in the United States in 
saying we don't think this third party certification is 
necessary for electronics, and the European commissioner were 
partners in a couple of the electronics categories. So it was a 
strange situation for European regulators and industry in the 
U.S. to be allied but we both recognized that maybe a more 
tailored approach would have been better at that time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; And give me a little insight. Why is it or what
is it about the electronics products and electronics industry 
that makes that third party certification troublesome or more 
difficult?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;So what members have told us that there are a
couple of reasons why it's relative burden for them. First, it 
takes some time out of the product development cycle.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;It takes a few days or maybe a couple of weeks for testing 
and paperwork to clear, and for an industry such as ours, 
again, with products that have relatively short product life 
cycles, maybe they're on the market for only a number of 
months. Two weeks is 2 weeks of sales, right? So we are an 
industry in the tech industry that's used to self- 
certification in various regulatory realms including 
electromagnetic compatibility, FCC requirements and so forth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;So that's what we were used to. That's what we had in 
Energy Star, and with self-certification we had an excellent 
track record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    So the time to market penalty that comes with taking 
something out of the product development cycle for a period is 
a concern. The cost is there, too, and I suppose for big 
companies the cost isn't such a big deal unless you have a big 
product line under the Energy Star program. Then it really adds 
up. For a smaller company, a startup that wants to be Energy 
Star compliant, shouldn't we make it easier for that startup to 
be in the program?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; And sometimes critics of the provision say that
sometimes could allow manufacturers to perhaps cheat and to 
produce products that had the Energy Star label on them that 
maybe don't meet the Energy Star requirements or standards. How 
do you respond to somebody making that assertion or allegation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Well, I think for problem actors there should
be penalties, certainly removal from the program, removal from 
the database.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Penalization through this provision and this discussion 
draft that you would now then be back under third party 
certification for at least 3 years, that's actually weighted 
toward the more onerous side, I would say.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;But there's another angle to this, too. If the burdens to 
participate in the Energy Star program are too great, you could 
actually have companies manufacturing products that meet the 
spec that don't carry the label--just they didn't want to 
trouble with it. They get it to the store shelf. That was a 
point I made earlier.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    But essentially how are we supporting the Energy Star brand 
if the store shelf is full of products that meet the spec but 
some carry the label, some don't? I don't think that's good for 
the brand strength.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Is it correct that the proposed exemption only
applies to the initial certification testing and that the 
ongoing verification testing of compliance with the Energy Star 
is not effective?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;That's absolutely the case and a very good
point as well. We are not changing post-market verification. 
That's really important. Get out there, test the products on 
the shelves.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Our members do that to each other. But there's also 
organized ways of doing that now today under DOE and EPA and 
that should continue. It is not touched by this proposal.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Great. Thank you very much, Mr. Johnson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. 
Castor.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; You almost did it again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt; Almost caught myself.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;There is one female here on the committee. It
is not really a very good reflection of the country or even the 
Congress to have only one female and not many minorities. So I 
take this responsibility seriously to represent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;And what I want to say is the Energy Star program has been 
a real success story for Americans and American families and 
businesses. Since its inception in the 1990s, it has saved 
consumer substantial moneys. It has helped us conserve energy, 
which is important at a time where we want to control carbon 
pollution and other greenhouse gases.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;I thought Mr. Peters was right on when he said this is 
probably one of the least intrusive ways we can help put money 
back into the pockets of consumers and businesses, because 
after all it's voluntary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;And to answer Mr. Shimkus' concern over the return on 
investment, the return on investment for Energy Star has been 
impressive. Since its inception, Energy Star has cumulatively 
saved $2.5 billion in energy costs. In 2015, homeowners saved 
$360 million in energy costs, approximately 30 percent of their 
energy bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Since 1995, 1.7 million Energy Star homes have been 
constructed and in 2016 approximately 92,000 Energy Star-
certified homes were constructed in the U.S. America is a 
leader here, globally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;The Energy Star program is internationally recognized as a 
proven standard for energy efficiency. A lot of the other 
countries are catching up but America has been the leader and 
we need to continue to be the leader.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;But my takeaway today from the expert testimony is just 
kind of what was stated at the beginning. If it's not broken, 
why fix it? With all of the other pressing issues here before 
the Congress this is one that I think, based upon the testimony 
when you look at the track record, the savings for consumers, 
why fix it?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;But we do have to be on guard because the Trump 
administration did propose a total elimination of Energy Star 
in its last budget. I strongly oppose that. This has been a 
vital lifeline for cost savings for consumers and helping us 
conserve energy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    So I want to make sure all of the witnesses are on record 
on that today. I'd like all of you just to answer yes or no. Do 
you support or oppose the Trump administration's proposal to 
totally eliminate Energy Star?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; Oppose.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Strongly oppose.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; Oppose.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Drew&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt; Oppose.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;So you would oppose elimination as well? I hear
what you all are saying about the shift to the DOE. Most here 
are opposed to that as well. I took Mr. Merritt's comments very 
seriously that they lack experience at the DOE to do this. I 
wonder, there also are going to be some significant costs if 
the Congress were to make this move.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    Ms. Callahan, do you know what it would cost to shift the 
program entirely from EPA to DOE?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;I do not know what that would cost. I know
what the budget at EPA is now. It is $42 million. I know that 
the entire budget at the EERE office, which is probably where 
it would land, is about $2 billion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;The president proposed almost an 80 percent cut to that 
budget and the House has recommended about a 40 percent cut to 
energy efficiency programs over there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;    So we don't see where the money comes from to support that 
cost and that change.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; Mr. Merritt, do you have any information on
what you think it would cost to shift DOE entirely?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; I do not, but I would support Ms. Callahan's
comments.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; Does anyone else want to comment on the
potential cost of shifting and the loss of professional 
expertise that's currently at EPA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;We don't think the cost to the federal
government would be any more if the program for appliances were 
at DOE than EPA. I agree with the adage if it ain't broke don't 
fix it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;I think it is broke when the appliance portion went over to 
EPA and there have been inefficiencies there. So I would make 
the argument that if they were shifted back to DOE there would 
be more efficiencies and less cost for running the appliance 
portion of Energy Star program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    We want the program to be funded.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; Do you have any hard data on that? Any studies?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; I don't have hard data. I don't think----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;I think it's an open question right now and,
because you would clearly incur significant costs including 
hiring and training of new staffers, standing up new online 
data systems comparable to those at EPA to collect 
certification data, that allows building owners to track their 
energy waste and waste consumption. It is not as simple as just 
snapping your fingers, especially in this budget arena where--
and I think Ms. Callahan's comments are very well taken. The 
proposed decimation of the EERE budget at DOE and then you're 
going to increase costs by the shift and then probably put all 
of Energy Star at risk when DOE subsumes it all. I would be 
very concerned for consumers and our ability to put money back 
into their pocket.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    I yield back the balance of my time. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;The gentlelady yields back and, ma'am, if you're
the only member of this committee that's female we are proud of 
that because you are the MVP. I see you chase down a ball in 
center field like George Springer from Astros. He's an MVP. 
You're an MVP.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the member from West Virginia.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    Ms. Callahan, it's good to have you here. I have enjoyed 
working with you over the years I have been here in Congress. 
It is good to be able to continue a discussion on energy 
efficiency and I particularly appreciated the work over the 
last 7 years with you and also Peter Welch. What a great 
champion of that and I think it has been beneficial for us to 
be able to team up.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; And we've appreciated your leadership
tremendously.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;So one of the questions--I guess I am having some concerns 
as well about creating an exception under the verification. I 
am a strong advocate of IV&amp;amp;V--independent verification and 
validation--that we've used in NASA and elsewhere where we have 
someone else looking at it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;I am also familiar, having come from the construction 
industry on efficiency, of dealing with UL, the Underwriters 
Laboratory, and Factor Mutual--FM.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    Can any of you give me an indication, because they've been 
around for decades--is there an exception to UL ratings or FM? 
Can anyone share----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I am being looked at so I will respond.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;This is different than product safety. Energy efficiency is 
different than product safety and I would note that in product 
safety, of course, there is third party certification that's 
very important. But there's actually no post-market 
verification for product safety.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;With Energy Star, we are talking today about an approach 
that includes premarket certification and post-market 
verification. It is relatively more burdensome than product 
safety.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Should that be the case in all cases? I think we need that 
balance.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;Maybe we are just picking nuances of this.
But I am just curious. I am not sure that I am going to embrace 
the idea of an exception on this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;I have come from an industry that we depend on it. When you 
see a UL rating you know it's good. You know it has been done 
independently, and the same thing with FM.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    Maybe, Mr. McGuire, go back to you on some of your 
comments. What was broken that Ms. Castor made that remark? 
What was broken in 2009 that caused the administration back in 
2009 to switch from DOE over to EPA? What was broken then that 
they were intending to fix?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Sir, I don't know the answer. I don't know
what was broken. I would submit that nothing was broken and 
what happened was the program that oversees Energy Star for 
appliances at EPA today became diverted from the energy 
efficiency mission and got into things like warranties and 
procurement rules and performance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    So we'd like to fix it. We'd like to have it go back and be 
part of the whole appliance efficiency policy apparatus where 
you have the minimum standards and Energy Star above that and 
they can be coordinated as they used to be.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;I just don't want anything to come in between
the government or whatever and energy efficiency and Energy 
Star. We've made great strides with this and I am looking to 
see what's going to facilitate it the best and that's why I was 
trying to understand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;Can any of the rest of you share with me what was broken in 
2009 that caused the administration to switch it or to flip it?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    OK. Thank you and I yield back my balance of my time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the gentleman from Vermont, Mr. 
Welch, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Thank you very much and thank you for this
hearing. The witnesses have been tremendous.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;What I'd like to do is just lay out some of my concerns and 
then I have questions for each of you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;The question of moving the program from EPA to DOE, I am 
agnostic about things so--what department does it, but the 
concerns I have are, number one, it's very disruptive to make a 
move.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;You've got established expertise in one place than the 
other. Second, there's a real funding question that is really 
active because of the policies of the Trump administration and 
that's without passing judgment on them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;And then third, the continuity of this system is really 
important. So that's a concern I have. Will this on a practical 
level work, even if you think on a theoretical level it might?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;And I have got the APA standard issue is really about 
maintaining the flexibility and the agility of the current 
program. If you get into the APA, you get lawyers involved, and 
it becomes a contested hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;And what has been tremendous, I think, about Energy Star in 
general has been the voluntary nature of it and the cooperative 
nature of it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;And then third, the third party certification, we had that 
problem with LG when the voluntary part of it wasn't also 
consistent and honest, quite frankly. So how do you have 
confidence in the program if you're leaving it up to the 
applicants without review to make that decision?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;So those are the concerns I have in addition to the funding 
issue that across the government with the new administration is 
all in doubt--25 percent cuts pretty much across the board.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    So that's where I am coming from. I think maybe we can work 
these out. But let me ask Mr. Drew, first of all. You've 
focused on the impacts of moving Energy Star to DOE. I know in 
the commercial building side of the program a number of home 
and commercial building organizations are supportive of EPA 
running Energy Star and do prefer the status quo. Can you 
elaborate on your experience with EPA's operation of these 
building programs?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Drew&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt; We are referring specifically to that portfolio
manager program. For commercial buildings when you're buying 
large equipment that consumes a significant amount of energy, 
the ability to go in and model the Portfolio Manager program, 
how the purchase of higher efficiency equipment, potentially 
Energy Star, is going to impact the overall energy usage and 
the potential cost savings for that building owner is 
significant for our members.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Thank you. I don't have a lot of time. Let me
ask you, Ms. Callahan, about your thoughts on the APA process 
as opposed to the current process.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; I agree with you completely that it could add
significant time and cost and complication. You're putting a 
formal process design for regulatory programs that have the 
force in law in place on a voluntary program and we think that 
that's very troubling.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Do you have any changes that you would support
in the process?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Yes. We should support working with the
committee, working with the agencies and the other stakeholders 
to look at ways that we could put in place more transparency 
and perhaps more discipline to the program. And so by dint of 
guidelines, best practices, policies to be--there's a lot that 
we can do that's short of what I think is a really over step.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    Mr. Merritt, let's go on this requiring APA procedures. Can 
you suggest some changes EPA has recently made to facilitate 
manufacturer input?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;Yes, thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;We've seen recent changes in the process to include more 
reliance on industry standard test procedures and standards as 
opposed to creating their own, which may not be as generally 
accepted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;We've also seen some recent changes in terms of what I 
mentioned earlier, having multiple rounds of specification open 
for comment which allows manufacturers to be fully heard.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt;    I would support Ms. Callahan's comments that perhaps making 
that more consistent across the board to allow more 
transparency would be a good thing. I think we should do that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;All right. Thank you. I have got time for one
more but that, I appreciate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    Mr. Johnson, the cost and the timeline of third party 
certification is a burden. You think it slows product 
development. But I have heard the third party certification 
body states it only takes about 2 weeks to certify new product 
and $3,500 to do the necessary work. Is that accurate, in your 
view?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; The cost and the time can certainly vary. But
I think it sounds about right and I would stress that that 2 
weeks is a big deal when your product is out on the market for 
only a few months.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;OK. I thank all the witnesses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I yield back and I think we've got a lot to 
work with here.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;You betcha. Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the member from the Commonwealth 
of Virginia, Mr. Griffith, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I thank my friend very much and appreciate
it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Mr. McGuire, I have heard you testify today that the 
Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers' position is to 
move Energy Star for home appliances from EPA to DOE.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    I have a constituent glass company that has had a very 
positive experience with the windows program at EPA. Do you see 
any challenges in keeping certain programs like the windows 
program at EPA while moving the home appliances program to DOE?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Sir, my answers would be that for 13 of its 21
years of existence Energy Star program for home appliances--
home appliances were at DOE and not EPA. So I don't see any 
issues with appliances being shifted back to where they started 
from. Other products are not.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    EPA and DOE both have had responsibilities in the program 
and the important thing about appliances is that the efficiency 
levels and the testing is so integrally tied to the standards 
and test procedures. The expertise at DOE is there to deal with 
that. So we may be a unique case in terms of how our standards 
and Energy Star requirements are intertwined.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I am going to go a little off the subject
matter but I am going to ask you some questions based on some 
communication I have gotten from a constituent who has spoken 
to me numerous times about this problem and it deals with our 
Energy Star program and that is that she's not completely 
convinced that what we are doing is actually beneficial in the 
long term and she brings up her washing machine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;That is her issue. Anita of Tazewell County has asked me to 
ask these questions over the course of the last year or so 
because she believes that in order to get a higher efficiency 
rating that her top loader washing machine was designed so that 
it didn't put as much water into the machine and she didn't 
feel like her clothes were getting as clean.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;And so what happens when somebody doesn't feel like their 
clothes are getting as clean you figure out some way. I have 
heard stories of other people who have done more loads of wash 
so they put less clothes into the machine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;In her case, she babysits the machine, as she told me, and 
she has a contraption hooked up with her garden hose and she 
adds additional water to the washing machine because the 
machine--apparently if you interrupt the cycle at a certain 
point doesn't realize that you're putting more water in and 
it'll heat all the water.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;And it seems to me that maybe we ought to be looking at a 
total efficiency and not just the energy rating because if 
people are doing more loads of laundry or stopping the machine 
after it's gotten started and filled up to a certain point and 
adding additional water to the machine doesn't seem to be very 
efficient.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I should note that I do have a picture here--probably can't 
get picked up on the camera--of Anita with her device filling 
in the washing machine with additional water.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    So what do you say to folks like Anita who say, wait a 
minute? In fact, the heading on her email was, get the EPA out 
of my laundry room--it's destroying our consumer washing 
machines.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Well, we take her concerns very seriously and,
as I mentioned earlier, the law that governs how the standards 
are set says you have to balance energy efficiency with cost 
effectiveness and the performance of the product.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;And so this problem can occur at both the standard level 
and Energy Star. At some point, there is a diminishing return 
on the energy savings and the performance of the product.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;We saw that 3 years ago with dishwashers where the proposed 
standard level would not clean a load of dishes. And so to have 
Energy Star level above and beyond that made no sense.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    That's why those decisions need to be made at DOE and be 
based on fact. So we want consumers to be happy with our 
products. We want our products to work, and that requires that 
people who set standards and develop test procedures understand 
how these products work and the laws of physics.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Mr. Johnson, I think you touched on this a little bit in 
some of your testimony earlier too, not directly but close to 
it. Do you have something to add to that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Only that our products are using zero amount
of water today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;We are very efficient in the energy sense, of course, and 
take great pride in this program. I want to make sure it 
continues. Are open minded if Congress should decide to move 
this energy efficiency program to the Department of Energy. We 
will work hard to make sure it's successful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    We do have questions. We have relationships. We are used to 
doing business with the EPA. But, again, these relationships 
can be redeveloped. There's a lot of passion behind the 
program. We want to carry that wherever it goes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; I appreciate it and yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the gentleman from the home of the 
Hawkeyes, Mr. Loebsack, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Loebsack&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chair, and they had a great
victory over Ohio State last weekend, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;I didn't realize when I got elected to Congress that there 
would be so much levity at these hearings sometimes. Thank you 
for your comment about water. I appreciate that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;    I do want to follow up with one of my previous colleague's 
questions, if I may, Mr. Johnson. I am not sure that you 
completely addressed Mr. McNerney's question about what's a 
good track record. How do we define that, in your case?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Sure. A good track record of compliance in my
mind is certainly one where there's no egregious examples of 
failure--of producing Energy Star-qualified products but not 
quite meeting the requirements. And I am not talking about 
paperwork violations. I am talking about egregious acts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    So when I say 100 percent track record of compliance, I am 
taking that characterization directly from EPA at the time it 
instituted third party certification for everybody.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Loebsack&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt; Right. Does anybody else want to comment on
that particular issue? Your thought about that? Because that's 
part of what we are talking about here. Did you want to say 
something, Mr. Merritt?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; I would just add that we have seen instances
in the lighting industry, of vendors claiming Energy Star 
compliance that did not have Energy Star compliant bulbs or 
products. So we consider the cost and timing of third party 
certification to be worth it in order to protect the brand.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Loebsack&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;To avoid fraud and abuse in the first
instance, right? I have to say, I think the Energy Star program 
has saved consumers money. It has lowered greenhouse gas 
emissions, as was mentioned by Ms. Castor. I think it's been a 
great program. I have a lot of appliances that are Energy Star 
and they save us a lot of money every month. Part of the issue, 
of course, is the up front costs for some of these.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;But, I think it's a great idea. And one of my colleagues 
already mentioned UL--Underwriters Laboratories. It is a 
company that does third party certification. We can't forget 
that they're in some people's districts as well and UL is in my 
district.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;They've got a lab in Newton, Iowa, and they employ over a 
hundred folks, and I think that's something that we do need to 
take into account when we are making policy. Obviously, we are 
talking about energy savings. We are talking about making sure 
we are doing the right thing from a regulatory standpoint.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;But I think we do have to look at the bigger picture, too, 
when it comes to jobs. After all, that's a big part of what we 
are trying to do here in the Congress--make sure that we create 
jobs, save jobs and do the right thing as far as our 
constituents are concerned and the country is concerned on that 
front, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;So I did want to bring that up as well. I also want to 
agree with some of my colleagues that, I guess to use the word 
agnostic that I think Mr. Welch used, that's how I am about 
sort of transferring this to the Department of Energy, so long 
as we can do the right thing, so long as we can make sure that 
we have compliance and that there isn't the fraud and abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;I think that's the most important thing and I do want to 
reiterate, you know, when we talk about the cost of regulations 
and the cost of government, moving from one agency to another 
there can be a lot of costs associated with that and I just 
want to make sure that we understand that before any decision 
gets made to move these obligations from one department to 
another. It is not simple. It may be theoretical but we have to 
thinking about it pragmatically as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt;    Ms. Callahan, did you want to address also the issue of 
transparency and discipline? I know that Mr. Merritt did but 
would you like to add to that at all?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;Sure. What I would like to say in front of
that, though, is I was looking through my papers to see how 
many jobs are actually in your district that are related to 
energy efficiency. There are 2.2 million jobs in the U.S. that 
are within the energy efficiency arena. So I think you make a 
very good point there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;With respect to transparency and certification, we want to 
make sure that there's a balance and that consumers are 
protected and that they can continue to trust in the label. If 
we can find ways to make the program less costly for compliance 
and relying on third party certifications on industry standards 
versus having EPA or DOE create their own, we want that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;    We want to take down the cost in the program. But it has to 
be balanced with making sure that we keep the integrity of that 
Energy Star label intact.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Loebsack&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt; Ultimately for the sake of consumers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Loebsack&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt; That's the bottom line here.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Exactly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Loebsack&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Loebsack"&gt; Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate
the panel and thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. 
Long, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Chairman, how
are you feeling today?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt; Very good. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt; How are your math skills today?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt; They're what they were when I walked in here. So
I thought they were pretty good but you've got something for 
me.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt; I have been working on a mathematical equation
here. Eleven minus one would be how much?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt; I believe that is 10. I am sure you're talking
about the World Series.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;Ten. That's what I have gotten to and I was just
trying to figure out how many more World Series championships 
the St. Louis Cardinals have won than the Houston Astros.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;You have now answered my question. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;I want to start down on the end with Mr. McGuire and I have 
a question for everyone. I just want to move down the row and 
get a quick response to my question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;One of the goals of the voluntary Energy Star program it 
set out an energy policy after 2005 is to reduce pollution, 
which we all want. Like Johnny Morris Bass Pro Shops in the 
Seventh District of Missouri says, we all live downstream--we 
all want to reduce pollution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;Mr. McGuire, start with you and coming down the line. Can 
any of you tell me what effect or how it would hurt if to move 
from EPA back to DOE where this program was originally? And 
there's been a lot of talk today about moving it and why they 
moved it in 2009 and how hard it would be to move it back when 
the ones that are arguing to not move it back are the ones that 
moved it in 2009.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;    But can you give me any reason why moving it to the 
Department of Energy for an Energy Star program would have any 
effect on pollution, good or bad, compared to EPA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; It would not impact it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt; OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;I want to make sure that we are clear. Joe
and the appliance manufacturers are looking at moving back the 
appliance portion. Energy Star program is much bigger and 
broader than that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt;    We believe that it would do damage to move the entire 
program, which is what's in the discussions draft now, back 
over from EPA to the DOE program.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt; In what regard? What way?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Well, because there's 25 years of history, of
databases, of partnership relation and management, brand 
management that are going on and people are relying on that 
program and on how it's being administered. And to pick that up 
and move it will have costs associated with it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt; It was the 25 years administrated under--right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Pardon?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt; It was the 25 years you're talking about?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; With the EPA. This has been a shared program
since it was created----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;Right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;    Ms. Callahan [continuing]. In 1992 and that--a large 
portion of the program has been always over at the 
Environmental Protection Agency.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt; Right. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; So as I mentioned during my testimony, our
primary concern is continuing the viability and smooth 
operation of this program. We would be concerned that any 
change that would disrupt that operation and the implementation 
of the specifications of the marketplace could actually reduce 
its effectiveness, which would increase electrical consumption, 
which would affect pollution, if you want to make that 
connection.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Drew&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt; From AHRI's perspective, our comments would echo
those of Mr. Merritt and Ms. Callahan. We've successfully 
operated this program within the EPA's structure for numerous 
years and the idea that if it was disruptive moving it from DOE 
to EPA initially, why wouldn't it be just as disruptive moving 
it back if not more so at this point in time with a much larger 
program at stake?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I don't have a view on the pollution impacts.
I tend to doubt it would have an impact. We are not agnostic 
about moving it to DOE. We understand the reasons why.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    If Congress decides to do so we'll work hard to make sure 
it's successful. We are used to doing business at EPA. That's 
where our relationships are. That's not to say we can't 
recreate success over at DOE.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt; Mr. Johnson, the discussion draft and change of
provision that would make the requirements of the 
Administrative Procedure Act apply to actions taken under 
Energy Star. The critics of this provision say it could damage 
the program by slowing it down. As the maker of products that 
need to get to the market quickly do you see this as a problem?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I see it as a potential problem. We certainly
want to maintain program agility and flexibility. That's really 
important for the fast-moving consumer tech sector. But I think 
there are ways to do that while bringing on perhaps a few more 
checks and balances. Process aspects of the APA perhaps could 
be applied to the program. Third party oversight within the 
federal government such as a role for OMB is something to 
consider as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    So on this provision we'd welcome working with the 
committee to maybe target this a little more appropriately for 
our sector.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Long&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;OK. Thank you, and thank you all for being here,
for your testimony today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Long"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back and I want to inform the
gentleman that I just got a text from Mayor Allen Owen of 
Missouri City, Texas, the Show-Me City. He says, please come 
down to our victory parade this Saturday barbecue in Missouri 
City for our Houston Astros, the world champs. He said yes, 
it's our first but we have to start somewhere.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    I now yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. 
Sarbanes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Sarbanes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the panel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;I was curious what happens other places. I am sure you're 
familiar with these kinds of incentive programs or Energy Star 
like initiatives in other countries or have some sense of that 
and I am interested how we compare to that, whether the 
analogous regime around labeling energy efficient products is 
mandatory in other places, voluntary. So I just want to get 
some context for that as we kind of figure out what the best 
way to do this is here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;And then I am also interested in any interplay that occurs 
in terms of manufacturing products that get an Energy Star 
rating here pursuant to this program as those products go into 
Canada or into Europe or other countries what's happening--is 
Energy Star being converted into some other rating that's given 
in those countries, et cetera.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;    So I am just trying to get a little bit of a peripheral 
vision on the issue and anybody who feels competent to answer 
the question I invite them to do that. Yes?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; So the Energy Star program is really
recognized globally as the gold standard for public-private 
partnerships in this area and in fact it is licensed and used 
in the European Union, Canada, Japan, Ireland, Liechtenstein, 
Norway, Switzerland, and Thailand, and the government of Canada 
has weighed in to encourage the Congress to continue the 
program and continue funding to the program. They're in 
opposition to the administration's request to eliminate the 
program. It really is the gold standard around the world.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Sarbanes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt; Any other comments? Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;The Energy Star program in Canada is licensed
to the NRCAN, Natural Resources Canada, by the Energy Star 
program. So they will adhere to the specifications for the most 
part that happen in the U.S.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    Our members are very familiar with it. I would note that in 
Canada the Energy Star program is housed within the appliance 
standards program of Natural Resources Canada, similar to what 
we are suggesting be again the case for DOE.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Sarbanes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt; Go ahead.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; Sure. It is very important to us, the consumer
technology industry, to have policies and programs for energy 
efficiency that are generally aligned and harmonized around the 
world. Energy Star is an example of something like that. We 
also have these industry-led voluntary agreements that have 
been picked up in three regions of the world as well. So we 
appreciate when there is that globalization of an approach 
that, again, for us is innovation friendly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Sarbanes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;Sounds like the U.S. and the Energy Star
program is a global leader in setting standards like this and 
driving that kind of label other places. Is there any 
competing? I mean, you mentioned some countries and some parts 
of the world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt;    Are there some competing energy efficiency labelling 
programs out there? Or would you say that Energy Star is up 
here and everybody else is down here?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I can respond to that. There are a large
number of standards in labelling programs around the world and 
that is actually part of the challenge that we have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Look in the back of a product, you see examples of many 
different kinds of labels, maybe not for energy but that's what 
I am talking about is a proliferation of labels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    It is so much easier for either a small or a large company 
that wants to sell around the world to have one test, one 
designation, one label, an aligned program. That's what we 
strive for in the tech industry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Sarbanes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt; Has Canada, for example, or other countries
that use the Energy Star rating, have they offered up any 
testimony that you're aware of or perspective? Have they 
weighed in at all about the discussion that we are having here 
in terms of the--any changes to the program? Do they have 
anxieties about it or are they just kind of sitting back and 
watching?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; We've discussed it with NRCAN and they don't
have any anxieties that I know of. They were more of in a 
listening mode. But they certainly are aware of what we're 
suggesting.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; We've had no discussion with them on the
discussion draft. Where I know their concerns lie is in keeping 
the program funded and not eliminating the program.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Sarbanes&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Sarbanes"&gt; Great. Thanks very much. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    The chair now calls upon the gentleman with the home of the 
Hidden Lake Gardens, Mr. Walberg, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;You've done your homework on the victorious
Michigan State Spartans as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;    I appreciate the hearing today. Mr. McGuire and Mr. 
Johnson, I'd like your comments on what has been the experience 
of your member companies when it comes to having opportunities 
to comment on actions taken under Energy Star and access to the 
data used by the government on which to base its decisions and 
is there room for improvement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;Thank you, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;It has been our experience that at EPA they are very 
inconsistent with demonstrating the data that they have used to 
make their decisions and responding to suggestions and data 
that we have submitted and providing a consistent amount of 
time for us to comment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    So there are question marks left at the end of the day and 
that is why we feel that applying some Administrative Procedure 
Act process improvements would make it more repeatable and 
understandable for the people that have to make the investments 
in their products for the consumers to benefit from the energy 
efficiency gains.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; Be a little more specific. Under the
Administrative Procedures Act, where would you go with that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;A specified period for comments--that you have
this many days to comment and that if a decision is reached 
that it might result in you--a specification you feel 
unwarranted or not justified by the facts that you would have 
the ability to appeal that to someone else in the agency other 
than the person that made the decision.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt;    We are not talking about loading up litigation. We are 
talking about due process so that we can understand how the 
decision was made.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; OK. Mr. Johnson.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I have similar comments. Our members'
experience in some Energy Star product categories has been good 
and not so good in others. I think there definitely is room for 
improvement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    We want data-driven outcomes. We have experienced outcomes 
with Energy Star specifications that don't seem linked so much 
to the data as to maybe a feeling or a passion in a different 
direction. So some amount of the rigor of the APA may be 
appropriate to guarantee certain checks and balances and time 
lines. However, as I mentioned earlier, we don't encumber the 
program. So we have to be, I think, selective at least for our 
sector in determining what of the APA makes the most sense and 
then what else might be a good check or a balance against 
outcomes here.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; But you believe that we could improve upon the
opportunities for the manufacturer input without slowing the 
program down?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; I think we can. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; OK. Mr. McGuire?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; I think with certain processes added that are
included in the Administrative Procedure Act it can be 
improved.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; OK. What's your reaction to the
administration's FY 2018 budget request which zeroed out the 
Energy Star program? If you answered that earlier before I got 
here, forgive me.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; I did. We oppose zeroing out the program. We
want it to be maintained and appropriately funded.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; Mr. Johnson?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;CTA doesn't have a position on budgetary
matters but in the situation where on one hand you have 
elimination of the program, on the other hand you have status 
quo, don't touch a thing, we are kind of in the middle.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    There's room for improvement. Let's work on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; Thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;    We've saved the best for last. The chair calls upon Mr. 
Tonko of New York for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Mr. Chair, I appreciate that assessment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Welcome to our witnesses. Energy Star is a program that 
benefits consumers, manufacturers, and the environment. We've 
heard all the statistics about the program's success so I won't 
belabor the point.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;But it is clear that the Energy Star label, which is 
recognized by 90 percent of consumers, is trusted. Supporters 
of the discussion draft have discussed how increasing 
transparency and accountability are important to the future of 
the program. But I believe the most important issue to maintain 
the integrity of the program is without a doubt upholding its 
well-respected brand with consumers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    We should not take consumer support for the brand as a 
given. Ms. Callahan, a question for you--and before I do that, 
let me state what an honor it is to serve on the board of 
Alliance to Save Energy in my pre-congressional days and now in 
my congressional tenure. So I thank you for that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Thank you. We really appreciate your
leadership up on Capitol Hill but we miss you a lot. When you 
were a fiduciary board member we saw a lot more of you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;There you go.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    So the question, and I will ask this of all, if we could 
kind of stick to a yes or no--do you agree that upholding the 
integrity of the Energy Star label is essential to the success 
of the program?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; Mr. McGuire?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Drew&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you. And in March 2010, GAO found the
Energy Star program in a report that was shared to be 
vulnerable to fraud and abuse. In this report, there were many 
concerns expressed and at that point many products were able to 
be self-certified.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    So in 2011, EPA responded to GAO's report and required 
third party certification. Ms. Callahan, if we go back to self-
certification and these issues reemerge, do you think a future 
report like this one I am holding would hurt the Energy Star 
brand?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; I absolutely believe it would hurt the Energy
Star brand to have a report like that. It hurt it the last 
time. It would hurt it again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; Mr. Merritt, do you agree?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; I do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; Mr. Drew, the Air Conditioning, Heating and
Refrigeration Institute is a certification body for testing 
products. Are certification bodies also responsible for 
conducting after-market verification testing?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Drew&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Drew"&gt; We do not only certification testing for all new
products entering the market. We also do annual verification 
testing done on a random basis selected from that manufacturer 
every year.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    And there's been a lot of discussion at this hearing about 
third party certification and the removal of third party 
certification. If that were done, who would be responsible for 
market surveillance? Anyone.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; I guess I will answer. The market
surveillance and after-market verification is currently the 
responsibility of the EPA and I would presume that that would 
continue.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;OK. So if we didn't have that third party
certification falling to the EPA, that would require additional 
spending for the EPA, which has already been threatened with 
some budgetary cuts. So I think we need to see that one or what 
it is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    Mr. McGuire, were you going to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McGuire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Mr. McGuire"&gt; I was just going to say EPA's third party
verification requirement is a responsibility they put on their 
partners. So that AHRI and AHAM do the verification--third 
party verification testing with independent laboratories each 
year. So those costs are being borne by the manufacturers, the 
partners, not the public, not by EPA.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; Can I clarify that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; Sure.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Callahan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Ms. Callahan"&gt; There are significant costs, though, that EPA
does bear to certify these third party accreditors and also the 
verification of the project in the marketplace. So there are 
very significant costs and EPA has that up on its website.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;And in the 2010 GAO report, EPA officials stated that 
limited resources made it difficult to do after-market product 
verification, not to mention at that point consumers may have 
already bought a fraudulent product.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    Mr. Merritt, is that why you do not support removing third 
party certification in conjunction with the warranty provision?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Merritt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Merritt"&gt; That's very much part of it. Essentially,
third party certification prior to listing ensures the 
integrity of the results. Relying on post-market certification, 
then there's a lottery that many bad actors are willing to 
enter. Their odds of getting caught are very low.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you. I will just add that according to one
certification body some types of products failed about 15 
percent on first time model submissions. So Energy Star 
succeeds because it is truly a partnership between industry and 
our government.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Removing third party certification would place all the 
burden on the government review submitted information, 
potentially conduct after-market verification, and could result 
in eroding trust in the program. Decades have been spent 
building consumer recognition and confidence in the Energy Star 
label. I would encourage us not to put that at risk.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Seeing that there are no further members wishing to ask 
questions, I'd like to thank all of our witnesses again for 
being here today and thank you for your patience. Lots of 
comments about my love for my Houston Astros and also an 
impromptu math lesson from Mr. Long.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;I have 18 documents I would like to submit for the record 
and very briefly, statements in support of H.R. 3777 from 
Congressman Buddy Carter, EPA testimony of the Energy Star

&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Olson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Olson"&gt;Pursuant to committee rules, I remind members
