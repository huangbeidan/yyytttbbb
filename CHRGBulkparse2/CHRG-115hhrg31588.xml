    &lt;peopleinfo&gt;on why I am excited to be here&lt;/peopleinfo&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;                     FROM THE STATE OF UTAH
    The  Chairman. As you all know, we have a Park Service that 
has a maintenance backlog. That is not unusual because we have 
a BLM that has a huge maintenance backlog as well as the Fish 
and Wildlife system with a huge maintenance backlog. One of the 
things we talked about just before we broke last Thursday was 
that pieces of legislation can actually help provide a 
mechanism to go forward on how we can reach that backlog, but 
one of the things we did not talk about in that process is this 
idea of leasing and lease management. I am excited about this 
for the simple reason that, in my home district, I am trying to 
establish another historic park where the rails met at the 
Golden Spike, which is about 30 miles from my home. I am 
interesting in seeing how this historic park is actually going 
to be managed.
    And if you actually do a lease process, not only can you 
get additional revenues coming into the process, but I think 
you are going to be involved in the community more in the 
process, and that is one of the things of which I am truly 
interested of how we can get local communities more involved in 
our public lands, including the ability of getting them to 
start becoming the ones we go to to find out the mechanisms of 
how lands are going to be managed and how the parks will be 
managed into the future. But far too often, it seems like we 
import somebody from some other part of the country in here 
when we have local people who care about this area, who know 
this area, who should be empowered to make more decisions on 
how these areas run. I think in the future that will bring a 
better way of managing the lands, it will bring a better way of 
attracting visitors, so tourism can develop in those particular 
areas, and hopefully we can move this entire process further.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;   Prepared Statement of the Hon. Rob Bishop, Chairman, Committee on 
                           Natural Resources
    Good Afternoon. Before we get started with opening statements, I 
want to thank the city of Hot Springs for hosting us today and for all 
of your help in making this hearing possible. I would like to thank our 
witness for joining us and sharing their experiences with us. Thank you 
for giving us your time.
    I would also like to thank Representative Westerman for bringing 
attention to this important program and encouraging us to look at Hot 
Springs as a model of success.
    Today, the House Committee on Natural Resources meets to examine 
the Historic Leasing Program of the National Park Service. The public-
private partnership of leasing in the NPS is truly a win-win. It saves 
historic buildings and saves taxpayers money. It reduces the 
maintenance backlog in our national parks and creates jobs. And 
importantly, it is thinking outside of the box.
    Innovative programs like leases between the NPS and private 
business are the future of how we will manage our parks.
    You may have heard that the National Park Service is facing an 
$11.6 billion backlog of maintenance needs, and $37.6 million of that 
total is right here in Arkansas. It is going to take a wide variety of 
approaches to fix our parks. Historic leasing is one important tool.
    When a business leases a building from the National Park Service, 
they take on the cost of repairs. That not only saves the NPS money, 
but also frees up park maintenance staff to perform other priority 
projects. Putting buildings back into use ensures they get the 
attention they need. Hard-working tenants perform repairs and catch 
problems before they become insurmountable. The historic character of 
buildings is restored using the established standards for the treatment 
of historic properties.
    Leasing also means that boarded-up storefronts become thriving 
business districts again. The transformation that has occurred here in 
Hot Springs is remarkable. Your historic downtown is a point of pride 
once more and an economic driver of this community. We want to see more 
successes like this all across the country.
    We are also here today to see what can be done better. How can we 
grow the leasing program? How can we make it more user-friendly? Let's 
get rid of the red tape and bring in more support to fix our national 
parks.
    I'm looking forward to hearing about the Historic Leasing Program 
here in Hot Springs, what is going well, and where there have been 
bumps in the road. We can all learn a lot from Hot Springs National 
Park and the wonderful city of Hot Springs.
    Again, I want to thank everyone for being here today.
                                 ______
    The  Chairman. With that, I appreciate the fact that we are 
in a formal hearing. I am now going to do something that is 
different and actually going to turn the management of this 
hearing over to Congressmen Westerman, who is not just on the 
Committee, he is also the chairman of one of our subcommittees 
and does a great job. But I would remind the audience, once 
again, this is still a formal hearing, which means the rules of 
procedure that we have in the House will also have to be 
followed here. This is not a town hall. This is actually a 
Committee hearing. We will let Mr. Westerman explain how the 
timers will be working for you, but for the introduction of our 
guests and the actual calling of that testimony, I would like 
to turn the remainder of this meeting over to Mr. Westerman, 
whether he wants to or not.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS
    Mr.  Westerman. Thank you, Chairman Bishop. It is an honor 
to have you here with us today, and I appreciate your service, 
not only to the Members in your district in Utah, but to the 
country, and the work that you do on the Natural Resources 
Committee. I was especially glad to see us mark up the bill 
last week that looked at addressing the maintenance backlog.
    I also want to welcome my fellow Committee member, Amata 
Radewagen, from American Samoa. I visited her district before. 
It is a beautiful place if you can ever get a chance to get out 
there. And also welcome my colleague from Little Rock, 
Representative French Hill, who is joining the Committee today. 
Thank you for being here. And welcome everyone to Hot Springs, 
which is also my hometown. I am honored that you visited this 
wonderful part of the country. The Natural State has a lot to 
offer both to residents and tourists, and Hot Springs is no 
exception to that rule. Just to be official here, I am 
recognizing myself for a 5-minute opening.
    Today, we are focusing on one particular success story here 
in Hot Springs and that is Bathhouse Row, and specifically, we 
are looking at the National Park Service Historic Leasing 
Program that has allowed Hot Springs to grow economically while 
also saving the American taxpayer millions of dollars. It is a 
program I am eager to explore, to improve, and to potentially 
provide to other Americans across Arkansas and across the 
country.
    If you walk up Central Avenue, as we will do shortly after 
the conclusion of this meeting, you will see a magnolia-lined 
street bustling with economic activity and growth. There is a 
new boutique hotel going in on one side, with restaurants, 
small businesses, and more going up on the other. You would 
never guess that Central Avenue is the dividing line between a 
national park and a small town. Hot Springs National Park and 
the bathhouses preserved within are a crucial component to our 
town. Without the innovation provided by the Historic Leasing 
Program, our town would not be as successful as it is today.
    Hot Springs National Park is our Nation's oldest protected 
land, predating the Park Service, Yellowstone National Park, 
and the state of Arkansas itself. Set aside as a national 
reserve in the early 1800s, for generations people have flocked 
here for the healing thermal waters and public bathhouses. Hot 
Springs is the home to baseball spring training, and this is 
our resident Cubs' expert here to my right, the Chairman. We 
are going to also get to take a tour of the historic baseball 
trail.
    The  Chairman. And if I can interrupt for just a second, I 
was met by a couple of Cardinals fans out there. If any of you 
are Cardinals fans, you are dismissed now.
    Mr.  Westerman. We don't have a professional team here in 
the state, but I believe still 60 percent of the people who are 
in the baseball Hall of Fame participated in spring training 
right here in Hot Springs and a big part of that was because of 
the bathhouses, which we will fill you in on during the tour.
    However, as time passed and the interest in the thermal 
waters waned, attendance to the bathhouses dropped. By the 
1980s, nearly all the bathhouses had closed their doors, 
draining jobs from Hot Springs, killing tourism, and saddling 
the National Park Service with millions of dollars in 
restoration and maintenance work. Without innovation, these 
bathhouses, and perhaps the prosperity in Hot Springs as a 
whole, were headed in the wrong direction.
    Now enter the Historic Leasing Program. By law, the 
National Park Service has the authority to rent out unused 
buildings to entrepreneurs and local businesses. These 
businesses, in exchange for use of the space, must pay rent to 
the Park Service. More importantly, they must take on the 
maintenance cost of the buildings.
    For Hot Springs, this meant two things: (1) it breathed new 
life into a faltering downtown. The private businesses that 
began to inhabit the bathhouses anchored us through a 
catastrophic fire in 2014 and have continued to drive tourism 
and investment downtown; and (2) it saved the American taxpayer 
millions of dollars. It took the cost of refurbishment and 
yearly maintenance off the Park Service books, freeing up 
dollars for other investment around the park and around the 
system.
    The focus of this field hearing is simple. We are here not 
only to highlight the success of Hot Springs National Park, but 
we are here to examine the challenges facing the Historic 
Leasing Program. Nationally, the Park Service is facing nearly 
a $12 billion maintenance backlog. While the Historic Leasing 
Program is not a silver bullet, it is a valuable tool in the 
toolbox we need to consider when addressing the backlog. This 
hearing is, in part, to help identify the challenges with the 
program, and I am eager to hear from today's witnesses about 
how best we can improve the process and how to best distribute 
the program to other parts around the country.
    As we sit here right now, the Park Service has two things 
going on: (1) it has a $12 billion maintenance backlog, and (2) 
it has thousands of unused buildings and spaces that are 
contributing to that debt. As we are about to discuss, Hot 
Springs National Park figured out a way to put the unused 
buildings to work, while helping the local economy. I am eager 
to hear from our witnesses about the good work they have done 
promoting this program. I want to, again, thank everyone for 
traveling to my hometown, and I cannot wait to get this program 
implemented more nationally.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;  Prepared Statement of the Hon. Bruce Westerman, a Representative in 
                  Congress from the State of Arkansas
    Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for holding this 
hearing today, and welcome to my hometown of Hot Springs. I am honored 
that you have visited my wonderful part of the world. The Natural State 
has a lot to offer both residents and tourists, and Hot Springs is no 
exception to that rule.
    Today, we are focusing on one particular success story here in Hot 
Springs. Bathhouse Row, and specifically, the National Park Service 
Historic Leasing Program, has allowed my hometown to grow economically, 
while also saving the American taxpayer millions of dollars. It is a 
program I am eager to explore, improve, and potentially provide to 
other Americans across Arkansas and across the country.
    If you walk up Central Avenue, as we will do shortly after the 
conclusion of this meeting, you will see a magnolia-lined street, 
bustling with economic activity and growth. There is a new boutique 
hotel going in on one side, with restaurants, small businesses, and 
more going up on the other. You would never guess that Central Avenue 
is the dividing line between a National Park and a small town. Hot 
Springs National Park, and the Bathhouses preserved within, are a 
crucial component to our town. Without the innovation provided by the 
Historic Leasing Program, our town would not be as successful as it is 
today.
    Hot Springs National Park is our Nation's oldest protected lands, 
predating the Park Service, Yellowstone National Park, and the state of 
Arkansas itself. Set aside as a National Reserve in the early 1800s, 
for generations people have flocked here for the healing thermal waters 
and public bathhouses. Hot Springs is the home to baseball's spring 
training, as our resident Cubs' expert to my left mentioned, and over 
the years this town has hosted everyone from celebrities to gangsters.
    However, as time passed and interest in the thermal waters waned, 
attendance to the Bathhouses dropped. By the 1980s, nearly all the 
bathhouses had closed their doors, draining jobs from Hot Springs, 
killing tourism, and saddling the National Park Service with millions 
of dollars in restoration and maintenance work. Without innovation, 
these bathhouses, and perhaps the prosperity of Hot Springs as a whole, 
were headed for the gutter.
    Enter the Historic Leasing Program. By law, the National Park 
Service has the authority to rent out unused buildings to entrepreneurs 
and local businesses. These businesses, in exchange for use of the 
space, must pay rent to the Park Service. More importantly, they must 
take on the maintenance cost of the buildings.
    For Hot Springs, this meant two things: (1) it breathed new life 
into a faltering downtown. The private businesses that began to inhabit 
the bathhouses anchored us through a catastrophic fire in 2014 and have 
continued to drive tourism and investment downtown. (2) it saved the 
American taxpayer millions of dollars. It took the cost of 
refurbishment and yearly maintenance off the Park Service books, 
freeing up dollars for other investment around the Park, and around the 
system.
    The focus of this field hearing is simple--we are here not only to 
highlight the success of Hot Springs National Park, but we are here to 
examine the challenges facing the Historic Leasing Program. Nationally, 
the National Park Service is facing nearly a $12 billion maintenance 
backlog. While the Historic Leasing Program is not a silver bullet, it 
is a valuable tool in the toolbox we need to consider when addressing 
the backlog. This hearing is in part to help identify the challenges 
with the program, and I am eager to hear from today's witnesses about 
how we can best improve the process, and how to best distribute the 
program to other parks around the country.
    As we sit right now, the Park Service has two things going on: (1)

                                 ______
    Mr.  Westerman. Now I will introduce our witnesses. Our 
first witness is the Honorable Pat McCabe, the Mayor of Hot 
Springs, who has a unique interest in the bathhouses that he 
will share later. We have Ms. Tracy Simmons, the Chief of 
Commercial Services for the Midwest Region of the National Park 
Service, out of Omaha, Nebraska. We have Mr. Cole McCaskill, 
the Vice President of the Hot Springs Chamber of Commerce, who 
has worked very closely not only with the bathhouse projects 
but all the redevelopment downtown.
    Cole, I was telling somebody earlier that this past summer, 
Senator Boozman and I were able to meet with the Chamber of 
Commerce for the opening of the 100th new business since the 
fire in 2014. We appreciate your leadership on that.
    We have Mr. Tom Cassidy, the Vice President of Government 
Relations and Policy with the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation, out of Washington, DC. And we also have Mr. Bob 
Kempkes, the owner of the Quapaw Bathhouse and Spa. He is also 
an architect and has done a lot of work on not only the 
bathhouse side of Central Avenue but also many of the other 
businesses along Central Avenue.
    I want to remind everyone about the sound system we have. 
The microphones are hot at all times, so you can see the green 
light here. If you need to mute your microphone at any point, 
just press and hold the button down, but as soon as you release 
the button, your microphone is hot again.
    Just a few pieces of housekeeping here. You will see the 
timers situated around. When you begin your testimony, the 
lights on the timers will turn green. After 4 minutes, the 
yellow light will come on. I know in Arkansas when we see a 
yellow light, a lot of times that means we speed up before the 
red light, and you probably want to speed up because when the 
red light comes on, your time is over. And to keep us on track, 
we will have to follow those time limits pretty strictly.
    Again, I would also like to remind our audience that this 
is a congressional hearing, not a town hall, and unfortunately, 
there will be no time for public comment during the meeting.
    We will now hear testimony from our witnesses, and to start 
off, the Chair recognizes Mayor Pat McCabe for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;          SPRINGS, HOT SPRINGS NATIONAL PARK, ARKANSAS
    Mr.  McCabe. Thank you very much.
    As mayor of Hot Springs, let me welcome you to our 
community. We are very pleased that the House Committee on 
Natural Resources has elected to hold a meeting here to explore 
the feasibility of expanding the leasing programs to other 
national parks across the country. The vibrancy of any 
community can be measured with a stroll through their downtown. 
The heart of downtowns across America have not been without 
challenge.
    The city of Hot Springs has had similar challenges over the 
years. Bathhouse Row had been very vibrant up to the 1970s, but 
from that point forward until recent years, not so much so. The 
Buckstaff Bathhouse for years was the only facility on 
Bathhouse Row that was operational. Today, the only structure 
which is vacant is the Maurice Bathhouse. When visitors and 
locals alike now stroll Bathhouse Row, they are able to avail 
themselves to the very bathhouses that have now been 
refurbished.
    Without the leasing program of the National Park Service, 
the bathhouses would remain vacant. We thank the National Park 
Service for their assistance in the revitalization of our 
downtown. I would like to personally thank former Hot Springs 
National Park Superintendent Josie Fernandez for her efforts in 
this regard. We also look forward to working in partnership 
with Superintendent Laura Miller as we strengthen ties and 
complete the build-out of Bathhouse Row and the business side 
of Central Avenue.
    On a personal note, my wife, Ellen, and I were interested 
in implementing a business in downtown Hot Springs. We inquired 
of our architect friends, Bob Kempkes and Anthony Taylor, as to 
structures that might be available on the business side of 
Central Avenue. Upon entering the Hale Bathhouse, we were 
greatly surprised and pleased that the National Park Service 
years before had removed the lead-based paint and asbestos 
thereby leaving the structure bare of interior finish. The 
ability of the National Park Service to ready any facility in 
this manner makes it very desirable for leasing since the 
abatement process can be time-consuming and expensive.
    Following the walk-through, we completed the application of 
the National Park Service for a lease. A letter of intent was 
issued in June of 2014. After working 18 months with a local 
bank and another entity, the local bank elected not to finance 
the project. We were without wind in our sails. One of the 
challenges in securing financing, in part, was the fact that my 
wife and I would not be owners of the building. Therefore, the 
bank, to get comfortable with their ability to be made whole 
should we fail was a challenge for them because the building 
could not be used as collateral, nor could the physical 
improvements to the building. The National Park Service needs 
to be sensitive that collateralizing projects of this size can 
be a challenge for the banks.
    The lease that was proposed by the National Park Service 
was a lease that the lending institution felt was overweighted 
in favor of the National Park Service in providing great 
exposure to the lending institution. A significant area of 
concern was the distribution, or lack thereof, of insurance 
proceeds if the structure was significantly destroyed or 
destroyed in total during our occupancy. The original agreement 
allowed the National Park Service to retain all the insurance 
proceeds and elect not to rebuild, leaving my wife and I with 
no ability to satisfy the loan except through personal funds. 
The financing entity was able to negotiate a provision within 
the lease that would insulate them as well as ourselves should 
the Park Service elect not to have a structure rebuilt if the 
historic nature of the facility was compromised.
    A loan must be guaranteed by the Small Business 
Administration, and they have their issues as well and need to 
have their agreements modified specifically pertaining to the 
collateral agreements so that the Federal Government would be 
protected and exposure would be minimized. However, some of the 
concern should not have been that great given that the funds 
being expended on this project were going into a Federal 
building and into a structure owned by Ellen and Pat McCabe. If 
we were to fail, the taxpayers would not really be out 
anything.
    Developing the plan for reuse can be a challenge even as we 
receive more input from others. I would encourage that the 
decision making on the build-out of bathhouses be left at the 
regional office level. Superintendent Fernandez and I agreed 
early on to remove ourselves from that process and allow the 
professionals to take the lead. The regional office has the 
expertise to work with our local project architect to make 
those decisions that need to be made.
    There are a lot of great things going on within the lease. 
There are about four factors that I did mention that are very, 
very strong and very, very positive. The areas that I mentioned 
were only those that I felt could be addressed.
    In closing, this quasi public-private partnership in the 
restoration of Bathhouse Row has been a win for the National 
Park Service, a win for the taxpayers, a win for the Hot 
Springs community, and a win for the leaseholders. The ability 
to establish a program that allows others to develop creative 
ideas within these fine structures ensures that they will be 
safeguarded and available for years to come without any holding 
costs to the Federal Government.
    Thank you very much.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt; Prepared Statement of Pat McCabe, Mayor, City of Hot Springs, Arkansas
    As Mayor of Hot Springs, let me welcome you to our community. We 
are very pleased that the House Committee on Natural Resources has 
elected to hold a meeting here to explore the feasibility of expanding 
the Leasing Program to other National Parks across the country. The 
vibrancy of any community can be measured with a stroll through their 
downtown area. The heart of downtowns across America have not been 
without challenge. Many have seen businesses move to fancy centers out 
of the heart of the city, leaving vacant buildings and storefronts. The 
city of Hot Springs has not been without similar style challenges over 
the years. Hot Springs differs from other communities in that a large 
footprint within the downtown area is the Hot Springs National Park. 
Bathhouse Row had been very vibrant up to the 1970s, but from that 
point forward until recent years not so much so. The Buckstaff 
Bathhouse for years was the only facility on Bathhouse Row that was 
operational. Today, the only structure which is vacant is the Maurice 
Bathhouse. When visitors and locals alike now stroll Bathhouse Row, 
they are able to avail themselves to the very bathhouses that have been 
repurposed.
    Without the Leasing Program of the National Park Service, the 
vacant Bathhouses would have remained vacant. We thank the National 
Park Service for their assistance in the revitalization of our 
downtown. I would like to thank former Hot Springs National Park 
Superintendent, Josie Fernandez, for her efforts in this regard. We 
also look forward to working in partnership with Superintendent Laura 
Miller as we strengthen ties and complete the build-out of Bathhouse 
Row and the business side of Central Avenue.
    The business side of downtown Central Avenue has also undergone a 
renaissance of sorts. This occurred, in part, with the creation of the 
Thermal Basin Fire District in November of 2013. The Thermal Basin Fire 
District required structures within its boundaries to provide a fire 
suppression system if the structure was three floors or greater. This 
resulted in a number of property owners selling their structures in 
lieu of meeting the new standard. New buyers of these buildings did so 
with creative ideas for new business opportunities. Recently, we 
celebrated the hundredth new business in downtown since February of 
2014. Now, both sides of downtown Central Avenue are very robust and 
provide an economic engine to the community.
    On a personal note, in September of 2013, my wife, Ellen, and I 
were interested in implementing a business in downtown Hot Springs. I 
inquired of our architect friends, Bob Kempkes and Anthony Taylor of 
Taylor Kempkes Architects, as to structures that may be available on 
the business side of Central Avenue. They indicated that, while there 
were no buildings available for lease/purchase on the business side of 
downtown Central Avenue, there were a couple of bathhouses available 
within the National Park. We immediately scheduled a day and time to 
walk through the Ozark Bathhouse and the Hale Bathhouse. My wife and I 
had a concept of establishing a boutique hotel with dining area within 
a downtown structure. While the Ozark Bathhouse appeared to be in 
exceptional condition for immediate use, the configuration of the rooms 
would require substantial demolition prior to repurposing as a boutique 
hotel with a restaurant. Upon entering into the Hale Bathhouse, we were 
greatly surprised and pleased that the demolition had already occurred, 
and we would be in a position to begin a restoration process with 
minimal additional demolition. The National Park Service years before 
had moved forward with the abatement of lead-based paint and asbestos, 
thereby, essentially leaving the structure bare of interior finish. The 
ability of the National Park Service to ready any facility in this 
manner makes it very desirable for leasing since the abatement process 
can be time consuming and expensive.
    Following the walk-through, we contacted the Hot Springs National 
Park Administrative office to determine the next steps. We received the 
Request for Proposal and set out to complete and provide the same. We 
did so in late February of 2014 in advance of the deadline of February 
27, 2014. Toward the end of June 2014, the National Park Service issued 
a Letter of Intent which we executed and began the process of securing 
financing following receipt of cost estimates from the architect. After 
working 18 months with a local bank and another entity, the local bank 
elected not to finance the project. Therefore, we were caught without 
any wind in our sails. However, the other entity was still onboard, but 
needed to have a bank partner which we then sought. One of the 
challenges in securing financing, in part, was the fact that my wife 
and I would not be owners of the building. Therefore, for the bank to 
get comfortable with their ability to be made ``whole'' should we fail 
was a challenge for them since the building could not be used as 
collateral nor could the physical improvements to the building be held 
as collateral, as the bank would not be able to remove the physical 
modifications to the facility, such as electrical, plumbing and heating 
and air. This would leave the financing entities with only items such 
as beds, mattresses, tables and chairs, refrigeration units, stove, 
etc. as collateral. The National Park Service needs to be sensitive 
that collateralizing projects of this size can be a challenge for the 
banks.
    The Lease that was proposed by the National Park Service was a 
Lease that the lending institution felt was overweighted in favor of 
the National Park Service and provided greater exposure to the lending 
institution. A significant area of concern was the distribution, or 
lack thereof, of insurance proceeds if the structure was significantly 
destroyed or destroyed in total during our occupancy. The original 
Agreement allowed the National Park Service to retain all the insurance 
proceeds, elect not to rebuild, leaving my wife and I with no ability 
to satisfy the loan balance except through personal funds. The 
financing entity was able to negotiate a provision within the Lease 
that would insulate them, as well as ourselves, should the Park Service 
elect not to have the structure rebuilt if the historic nature of the 
facility was compromised. As such, it took no less than 9 months for 
the financial entity and the National Park Service to negotiate an 
appropriate Lease.
    Our loan was to be guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, 
and they had their issues as well and needed to have agreements 
modified, specifically pertaining to the Collateral Agreement so that 
the Federal Government would be protected, and the exposure would be 
minimalized to the greatest extent possible. This too required some 
time and energy, though it was significantly less than that of the 
Lease negotiation. However, some of these concerns should not have been 
as great given that the funds being expended on this project were going 
into a Federal building and not into a structure owned by Pat and Ellen 
McCabe. If we were to fail, the taxpayers would not really be out 
anything, as the McCabe's would not have profited since the funds 
expended would have gone into a Federal building. Perhaps there can be 
some recognition of this fact and the ability for the SBA to gain 
comfort could be reviewed. In speaking with our leading financial 
institution, it appeared that the goals of the Park Service and the SBA 
were polar opposites in this regard.
    Developing the plan for the reuse can be challenging, and even more 
so when a number of varied players inject themselves into the design 
process. Superintendent Fernandez and I agreed early on to remove 
ourselves from the process and allow the professionals; the Project 
Architect, the Historic Architect of the Midwest Region, Health 
Inspector and the Life Safety Codes Officer to be responsible for 
decisions relating to how the varied codes would be met. The Regional 
Office has the capability of working directly with the Project 
Architect. While we all desire to have the National Park Superintendent 
accept an ownership role within their respective parks, the repurposing 
of this bathhouse would result in looking at varied ways in which to 
meet the required standards which would not necessarily be contained 
within the skill sets of a Superintendent. I would recommend that the 
National Park Service focus on being an advocate for repurposing these 
styled structures with decision making at the Regional Office level.
    The National Park Service was very thoughtful in the development of 
the Lease in many ways. The National Park Service allowed the Lease to 
be $1.00 a year for the first 3 years prior to elevating to the full 
Lease price. In this manner, the holder of the Lease would be able to 
build out the project and become operational with essentially zero 
Lease expense for the first 3 years. We anticipate being operational 
before year end which will allow us approximately 20 months of 
operations at $1.00 per year Lease expense. After which, we will 
increase to the stated amount in the Lease document. We will be well on 
our way to stabilizing business operations.
    Furthermore, the National Park Service provided credit in the Lease 
for the renovation costs of the facility. Here again this becomes 
favorable to the tenant, as the renovation costs are prorated over the 
term of the Lease reducing the effective monthly Lease expense. Without 
this credit for renovation costs, the Bathhouses may not have been 
renovated.
    The Lease requires that 2 percent of all gross sales be placed in a 
Capital Improvement Fund. Access to these funds can be used to repair 
and replace major plant and equipment. This better ensures that the 
tenant will always have funds to make major repairs and capital 
improvements should the need arise.
    The National Park Service provides for up to a 60 year lease. Ellen 
and I secured a 55 year Lease. While we certainly do not anticipate 
operating the project through the 55 years, we wanted to ensure that 
those that would come behind us would not be concerned that the Lease 
was about to expire. We felt that the project could change hands a 
number of times in advance of the expiration of the Lease. 
Consequently, those who would assume the project will know that they 
had the ability to purchase the operations and not have the Lease 
expire from underneath them.
    In closing, the Quasi-Public Private Partnership in the restoration 
of Bathhouse Row has been a win for the National Park Service, a win 
for the taxpayers, a win for the Hot Springs community and a win for 
the Lease Holders. The ability to establish a program that allows 
others to develop creative ideas within these fine structures ensures 
that they will be safeguarded and available for years to come without 
any holding costs to the Federal Government.
    Thank you for the opportunity to address the Committee today.
                                 ______
    Mr.  Westerman. Thank you, Mayor.
    Just a reminder, if you can't cover everything in your 
testimony, the written testimony will be part of the record, so 
if there were some areas you didn't get a chance to cover, we 
will have all those in the written record.
    And then a little more housekeeping details. After all the 
witnesses, we will have time where we will have questions, so 
we can pose any questions to you at that point.
    Next, the Chair recognizes Ms. Tracy Simmons to testify for 
5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt; MIDWEST REGION, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE 
                   INTERIOR, OMAHA, NEBRASKA
    Ms.  Simmons. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I 
appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today. We thank 
the Committee for approving H.R. 6510, the Restore Our Parks 
and Public Lands Act, on September 13. This initiative, which 
would direct up to $6.5 billion toward reducing the deferred 
maintenance backlog at our national parks and other public 
lands, is Secretary Zinke's Number one priority, and we 
appreciate the Committee's support.
    In addition to supporting the direct investment of Federal 
dollars through H.R. 6510, the National Park Service is 
committed to using every tool at its disposal to tackle the 
deferred maintenance backlog. One of these tools is to enlist 
willing lessees in assuming the maintenance responsibilities of 
our historical assets through the effective use of leasing 
authorities.
    The National Park Service has authority to lease historic 
buildings and other structures under two laws: the Historic 
Preservation Act of 1966 and the National Parks Omnibus 
Management Act of 1998. This authority allows us to enter into 
public and private partnerships to use properties that are not 
needed for park purposes. In some cases, it has enabled major 
rehabilitation projects that would have otherwise not been 
possible. One key provision in the statute is the authority to 
adjust the fair market value rent to take into account the cost 
of restoring and maintaining structures.
    Nationwide, the National Park Service currently has 
approximately 160 leases that cover over 340 structures. In 
Fiscal Year 2017, these leases generated over $9 million, money 
that was retained by the National Park Service.
    The National Park Service leasing program provides support 
to parks and regions of all aspects of the leasing process, 
including assisting with drafting requests for proposals, 
drafting lease documents, determining regulatory compliance, 
and increasing awareness of opportunities that are available 
through the leasing authority. The leasing program continues to 
develop formal training for staff to expand capacity across the 
National Park System.
    The historic bathhouses in Hot Springs National Park have 
often been cited as an example of success of the National Park 
Service's leasing program. Several facilities on Bathhouse Row 
have been rehabilitated and repurposed through leases and in 
combination with the historic tax credit program. The Quapaw 
was opened in 2008 as a bathhouse and spa under a 55-year 
lease. This was followed by the Ozark in 2009. The Ozark lease 
was eventually terminated but was later repurposed as an art 
museum operated by the Friends of Hot Springs National Park. 
The Superior Bathhouse, which reopened as a brewery in 2013, 
continues to successfully operate under a long-term lease. The 
Hale Bathhouse is being converted to a boutique hotel and is 
expected to open in the coming year.
    Elsewhere, three of our most notable projects are the 
Cavallo Point Lodge north of San Francisco, the Argonaut Hotel 
in San Francisco, and Williams Transco Facility in New York 
City. All three have resulted in large amounts of deferred 
maintenance costs being eliminated.
    While these examples demonstrate how the National Park 
Service leasing authority can be used to redevelop, repurpose, 
and revitalize park structures, this authority has not always 
resulted in a valuable lease. Despite the National Park 
Service's investment of millions of dollars to stabilize the 
bathhouse structures in Hot Springs over the years, numerous 
attempts to find operators for the last two bathhouses, the 
Maurice and the Libby, have been unsuccessful.
    In general, market conditions and market demand pose the 
greatest challenges to expanding the current leasing program. 
The majority of successful National Park Service leases have 
been located around large metropolitan areas, in particular New 
York, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, where there is greater 
demand to lease facilities.
    Challenges have also been encountered when working to lease 
parties to other government entities. While an authority called 
Service First allows the Departments of the Interior and 
Agriculture to enter into agreements to share resources, other 
fellow agencies do not have an authority to enter into a lease 
with the National Park Service. Instead, they must use the 
services provided by the General Services Administration, which 
entails a much more lengthy and complex process than the 
process available through Service First.
    The National Park Service leasing program continues to 
learn from the market and develop best practices, while 
expanding the portfolio of the lease properties across the 
system.
    Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement, and I would be 
pleased to answer any questions you or other members of the 
Committee may have.
&lt;/option&gt;

    We thank the Committee for approving H.R. 6510, the Restore Our 
Parks and Public Lands Act, on September 13. This initiative, which 
would direct up to $6.5 billion toward reducing the deferred 
maintenance backlog in our national parks and other public lands, is 
Secretary Zinke's Number one legislative priority and we appreciate the 
Committee's support.
    In addition to supporting the direct investment of Federal dollars 
through H.R. 6510, the National Park Service is committed to using 
every tool at its disposal to tackle the deferred maintenance backlog. 
One of those tools is to enlist willing lessees in assuming the 
maintenance responsibilities of our historical assets through the 
effective use of leasing authorities.
                        leasing program overview
    The National Park Service (NPS) has general authority to lease 
historic buildings and other structures, including associated property, 
under the Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (54 U.S.C. 306121) and the 
National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (54 U.S.C. 102102). These 
authorities allows the NPS to enter into public-private partnerships 
through leases that allow the lessee to use properties that are not 
needed for park purposes. In some cases, it has enabled major 
rehabilitation projects that would have otherwise not been fiscally 
possible.
    The NPS's leasing authority under the Historic Preservation Act of 
1966 and the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 are 
implemented by Part 18 of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 
These regulations require parks to make the determinations that the 
lease: will not result in the degradation of the purposes and values of 
the park; will not deprive the park of property necessary for 
appropriate park protection, interpretation, visitor enjoyment, or 
administration; will contain terms and conditions that will assure the 
leased property will be used for activity and in a manner that are 
consistent with the purposes established by law for the park; is 
compatible with the programs of the NPS; is for rent at least equal to 
the fair market value rent of the leased property; will adequately 
insure the preservation of historic property; and is of a term length 
of 60 years or less. These regulations also require parks to make the 
determination that the proposed activities under the lease are not 
subject to authorization through a concession contract, commercial use 
authorization, or similar instrument.
    The NPS is also authorized by statute to adjust the fair market 
value rent to take into account the costs to the lessee for 
preservation, maintenance, restoration, improvement, or repair and 
related expenses. This flexibility has been a valuable tool for the NPS 
to require the lessee to address deferred maintenance and continue to 
maintain and improve the facility during the lease term. It is often 
the case for facilities with a large amount of deferred maintenance 
that the lessee pays little or no rent during the lease term, because 
lessee's rent is reduced by these costs.
    Nationwide, the NPS currently has approximately 160 leases that 
cover over 340 structures. These leases generated $9,371,006 in total 
revenues in FY 2017 that were retained by the NPS. A few of the NPS's 
recent leases include a master residential lease at First State 
National Historical Park; a lease with Navajo Nation Hospitality 
Enterprises, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Navajo Nation, at Canyon 
De Chelly National Monument; and a lease with the U.S. Forest Service 
of two buildings at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. Efforts to 
increase the portfolio of leased properties continue by identifying 
properties eligible for leases.
    The NPS leasing program provides support to parks and regions on 
all aspects of the leasing process, including assisting with drafting 
requests for proposals (RFPs), drafting lease documents, determining 
regulatory compliance, and increasing awareness of opportunities that 
are available through the NPS's leasing authority. The leasing program 
continues to develop formal training for staff to expand capacity 
across the NPS to initiate and manage park-level leasing programs.
                         nps leasing successes
    The historic bathhouses in Hot Springs National Park have often 
been cited as an example of the success of the NPS leasing program. 
Several facilities on Bathhouse Row have been rehabilitated and 
repurposed through leases and in combination with the Historic Tax 
Credit program.
    The first bathhouse to be renovated and repurposed through a lease 
was the Quapaw in 2008. The Quapaw was opened as a bathhouse and spa 
under a 55-year lease. This was followed by the Ozark in 2009, which 
was repurposed as an art museum. The Ozark operated until 2013 when the 
lessee was unable to generate enough revenue to continue operations and 
asked to terminate the lease. The Ozark is currently operated by the 
park's non-profit supporting organization, the Friends of Hot Springs 
National Park, through an agreement with the park. It currently houses 
the Hot Springs National Park Cultural Center and displays artwork from 
the park's Artist-In-Residence Program. The Friends make the Ozark 
available for private events for a fee.
    The Superior bathhouse, which reopened as a brewery in 2013, 
continues to successfully operate under a long-term lease. The Hale 
bathhouse is expected to open as a boutique 10-room hotel in 2019.
    While these examples demonstrate how the NPS's leasing authority 
can be used to redevelop, repurpose, and revitalize park structures, 
there are instances where this authority has not resulted in an active 
lease. Despite the NPS's investment of millions to stabilize the 
bathhouse structures over the years, numerous attempts to find 
operators for the last two bathhouses, the Maurice and the Libby, have 
been unsuccessful. The most recent RFPs for the Maurice, issued last 
year, did not attract any offers.
    The NPS has had success with major leasing projects elsewhere in 
the National Park System. Three of our most notable projects are the 
Cavallo Point Lodge in Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the 
Argonaut Hotel in San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, and 
the Williams Transco facility in Gateway National Recreation Area. All 
three have resulted in large amounts of deferred maintenance being 
eliminated as a result of multi-million dollar investment from the 
private sector in projects involving renovation of historic assets. In 
all three cases, special park-specific leasing authorities were used in 
conjunction with system-wide general leasing authorities.
        federal rehabilitation tax credit (historic tax credits)
    Some lessees have been able to take advantage of the benefits 
offered by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, 
which is administered by the NPS in conjunction with the Internal 
Revenue Service and State Historic Preservation Offices. This program 
encourages private sector investment in the rehabilitation and re-use 
of historic buildings through tax credits on income-producing 
(commercial) properties. Examples include the Cavallo Point Lodge, the 
Argonaut Hotel, the Quapaw Bathhouse, and the Fort Mason Center for 
Arts and Culture in Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
    Navigating the multiple steps involved in obtaining historic 
preservation certification from the NPS is a complex process. Also, 
historic rehabilitation tax credits and other forms of third-party 
financing often require long-term leases. The NPS takes this into 
consideration when negotiating the final lease terms with a potential 
lessee and is always looking for ways to further partner with the 
private sector in the most seamless and appropriate manner.
                           leasing challenges
    While the examples given above highlight successes that have been 
achieved under the current leasing authority, the NPS has also faced a 
number of challenges in trying to utilize leases to reuse, 
rehabilitate, and revitalize our aging infrastructure. Some of the RFPs 
that have been issued by parks have received limited responses, or none 
at all. That was the case for a number of residential houses at Natchez 
Trace Parkway in Mississippi and for The Inn at Sleeping Bear Dunes 
within Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Michigan.
    Nowhere are the challenges more evident than at Fort Hancock within 
the Sandy Hook unit of Gateway National Recreation Area, where there 
are over 30 vacant structures. The park is making steady progress and 
has now entered into seven letters of intent that cover 13 separate 
buildings. However, the NPS has put a lot of effort into finding 
potential lessees and working with them to develop restoration plans 
that will fit the lessees' desired design and use. Given the historic 
nature of these structures, it is often difficult to negotiate terms 
that allow for the preservation of the historic fabric of the structure 
while at the same time providing the lessee flexibility to renovate the 
structure to meet their needs. Depending on the complexity of the 
restoration requirements, negotiations have sometimes taken years to 
complete.
    In general, market conditions and demand pose the greatest 
challenge to expanding the current leasing program. In intensely urban 
areas, there appears to be a greater demand from the public to lease 
facilities in parks for residential use, office space, or other 
commercial activity. The majority of successful NPS leases have been 
located around large metropolitan areas, in particular New York, San 
Francisco, and Philadelphia.
    In addition, developers and investors are often more interested in 
purchasing outright fee title to property, rather than investing in the 
rehabilitation of a property that is owned by, and possession of which 
will eventually be returned to, the Federal Government. Also, the lease 
opportunities available within parks may not provide a viable business 
opportunity given the higher costs associated with the restoration or 
rehabilitation of the structures compared to the lower rents that may 
be available, especially in rural and sparsely populated areas.
    Finally, NPS sometimes has difficulty executing leases with other 
government entities. The NPS has been able to enter into leases with 
other agencies within the Department of the Interior and the Department 
of Agriculture utilizing the Service First authority (43 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1703) which allows the two departments to enter into agreements to 
share resources. However, with respect to other Federal agencies, while 
the NPS has authority to enter into leasing agreements, the other 
agencies generally do not have a reciprocal authority to enter into a 
lease with the NPS. Instead, they use the services provided by the 
General Services Administration, which entails a much more lengthy and 
complex process than the process available through Service First.
    Mr. Chairman, the NPS greatly appreciates the Committee's interest 
in the leasing issue and looks forward to continuing to work with you 
on ways to further utilize public-private partnerships to help preserve 
and maintain the NPS's historic assets for future generations to use 
and enjoy. The Secretary remains committed to improving how this 
process works to make it more feasible and stable for historic leasing 
to occur. We look forward to working with you and your colleagues 
toward that end. This concludes my prepared statement and I am happy to 
answer any questions.
                                 ______
  Questions Submitted for the Record by Chairman Bishop to Ms. Tracy 
 Simmons, Chief of Commercial Services, Midwest Region, National Park 
                Service, U.S. Department of the Interior
Ms. Simmons did not submit responses to the Committee by the 
appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record.
    Question 1. The focal point of NPS historic leasing appears to be 
on the use of NPS buildings for commercial or business purposes. In 
addition to this use, it is clear that historic leases can be issued 
also for other purposes, such as residential and agricultural use. Has 
NPS issued historic leases for these purposes and do you agree that NPS 
favors broad and flexible use of historic leasing for a wide range of 
purposes--not just to run businesses?
    Question 2. NPS has testified that historic leasing is appropriate 
for buildings that are not used for ``park purposes.'' This is a very 
broad concept that could preclude almost any use of properties for 
historic leasing. We assume that ``park purposes'' would have a narrow 
definition for this limitation and would apply only to those instances 
where NPS itself intends to use and occupy a building for 
administration, management, public health and safety, or other similar 
purposes. For example, lessees can perform interpretation as well as 
NPS in many cases and we assume that interpretation of a historic site 
would NOT be considered the kind of ``park purpose'' that prohibits its 
use for historic leasing. Please confirm that our understanding is 
correct and provide any additional insight on the meaning of this 
phrase as applied to historic leasing.
    Question 3. It is commonly understood that one of the impediments 
to the use of historic leasing has been resistance at the local level, 
and from within individual parks, to adopt this innovative tool. Some 
superintendents are reluctant to yield their total control over 
buildings and historic properties to outside parties. Despite this 
well-known fact, it appears that NPS has continued to look to local 
park managers for a list of appropriate buildings for historic leasing. 
What is NPS doing from the HQ and regional office level to ensure that 
a broad and inclusive list of appropriate facilities is developed for 
historic leasing? Also, will NPS establish a process where third 
parties and potential lessees can identify those properties that would 
be the subject for historic leasing and, in doing so, activate a 
meaningful review process that is not subject solely to the whims of 
local officials?
    Question 4. Given the vast number of buildings that are available 
for historic leasing, we are surprised that only 47 properties have 
been identified by NPS as priority targets. What is NPS doing to look 
at the longer list of 9,000 or so buildings from which candidates for 
historic leasing can be drawn.
    Question 5. Much of the focus in the hearing has been on the use of 
historic leasing for buildings already in the maintenance backlog. It 
is clear that historic leasing can also be used as a strong tool to 
prevent structures from even being placed on the backlog. Does NPS 
agree that historic leasing should be used in a proactive manner to 
avoid the need to even put properties into the backlog? What steps has 
NPS taken to encourage the use of historic leasing to avoid a problem 
rather than just eliminate a problem that has already arisen.
    Question 6. On November 21, 2013, the NTHP responded to an NPS 
request by submitting a list of 12 NPS units that are prime candidates 
for historic leasing. A copy of that letter is attached. Did the NPS 
act upon the NTHP recommendations? Are most of those properties now 
under active leases?
    Question 7. One of the parks on the NTHP list of priority locations 
for historic leasing is the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Is 
there any prohibition that would prevent the use of historic leasing in 
this park?
    Question 8. The General Services Administration (GSA) is the 
commercial real estate expert for the Federal Government. Does the NPS 
reach out to GSA for subject matter expertise? Has the Park Service 
considered adapting GSA job aides or training curriculum for use in the 
NPS? What is the NPS doing to ensure staff have the resources and 
training they need?
    Question 9. What recommendations did the NPS implement after the 
completion of the 2010 ``Leasing Program Assessment''--a report that 
was completed by the Center for Park Management at the request of your 
agency?
    Question 10. The Northeast Region of the NPS has a high number of 
leases in place. Has the NPS implemented any Northeast Region practices 
service-wide to promote the success and expansion of historic leasing?
    Question 11. Many leases require lessees to deposit a percentage of 
their gross revenues into a maintenance reserve fund. While ensuring 
that funds are available for major repairs is important, a significant 
amount of capital can accumulate in those funds, as businesses grow and 
repairs are checked off. Would the Park Service consider establishing a 
cap on the total funds that need to be deposited into the maintenance 
reserve fund?
                                 ______
    Mr.  Westerman. Thank you, Ms. Simmons.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Cole McCaskill to testify for 
5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, HOT SPRINGS NATIONAL PARK, ARKANSAS
    Mr.  McCaskill. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I 
appreciate the opportunity to be here today to represent the 
business community of Hot Springs. The bathhouse leasing 
program has had an intensely positive impact on Hot Springs. I 
am going to share three observations that help to illustrate 
this point.
    Prior to the leasing program, the majority of the 
bathhouses sat empty, dark, and vacant. Since the program was 
created and filled these new bathhouses with new businesses, 
the national park side of the street appears to be open for 
business.
    So, it is a common principal in economic development that 
private investment follows public investment, so economic 
developers are always mindful to steer capital in a fashion 
that will catalyze further investment in an area. What is great 
about this scenario is that instead of shouldering the burden 
of capital outlay to open these bathhouses to the public, the 
national park leveraged the private sector's creativity to put 
this real estate back into productive use in financing the 
final property improvements privately, all the while retaining 
oversight of the land, real estate, and business.
    This reactivation of public space due to the leasing 
program will serve as a catalyst for private investment and 
business growth in our downtown historic district. As you have 
heard now, we have had over 100 new businesses open in the 
downtown area and over $80 million has been reinvested just in 
the past few years. I truly don't believe that would have been 
possible if the national park side of the street appeared to be 
closed for business.
    A second observation is that the businesses that are now 
occupying these bathhouses get an extraordinary amount of 
national and international attention, which pays dividends for 
our community when it comes to tourism. Due to the unique 
nature of these businesses and the uniqueness of the lease with 
the national park, the press loves these businesses.
    Just one example, the Superior Bathhouse Brewery operates 
the business on Bathhouse Row that is most fundamentally 
different from the original bathing experience. They sell beer 
that is brewed with thermal water. This is a very unique 
practice. In fact, it is the only business in the world that is 
doing this, and because of that, and because the beer is good, 
they get a tremendous amount of national exposure. In just 1 
year, they were covered by the Chicago Tribune and featured on 
the CBS Sunday Morning show with the rest of the national park. 
Our local tourism agency, Visit Hot Springs, estimates that 
just those two pieces of coverage reached nearly 3 million 
people and was worth over $120,000 in retail advertising value. 
That is exposure that we didn't have to pay for.
    This type of international coverage is very impactful on 
our local economy because it generates tourism interest from 
very credible editorial sources, and as you know, tourism is 
the Number one sector in our economy, employing over 22 percent 
of the workforce.
    My third observation is that the leasing program has a 
general reputation for being complicated, which may deter 
applicants. The average citizen of Hot Springs doesn't know the 
exact specifics of the leasing program. However, there is a 
perception that it is an extremely complicated and lengthy 
process. This perception is fueled by the drawn-out timeline of 
the process. Oftentimes, there is an announcement of a new 
business and then months and years can go by before the public 
sees any activity.
    The difficulty of this process is magnified when compared 
to the process of leasing historic space just a few dozen feet 
across the street in a privately-owned building, which a simple 
lease agreement and a few days is all you might need to move 
your business in, and a business oftentimes cannot take that 
long of a time period between announcing the business and 
actually moving in without revenue coming back in.
    This issue is also reflected in the fact that the few folks 
that do hold these leases are highly regarded in our community 
as having an extraordinary aptitude for success. These are not 
ordinary citizens. Pat McCabe is the mayor of Hot Springs and 
he has been the CEO of the hospital for nearly two decades. 
Anthony Taylor and Bob Kempkes are both successful architects 
and own multiple businesses under real estate developers. So, 
the fact that only the most exceptional people are holding 
these leases to the bathhouses makes me question the ability of 
the average businessperson to see this process through.
    In closing, the leasing program has an extremely positive 
impact on our community, especially the downtown area. I think 
it has set a foundation for the tremendous wave of investment 
we have seen over the past 2 years, and I am sure that none of 
this would have happened if the national park side of the 
street would have appeared to be closed for business.
    Thank you.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;   Prepared Statement of Cole McCaskill, Vice President of Economic 
               Development, Hot Springs Metro Partnership
                              introduction
    Hot Springs National Park's Bathhouse Leasing Program has had an 
incredible impact on the community and economy of Hot Springs, 
Arkansas. In this testimony, I will illustrate some of the most 
important factors related to the benefits to the community of this 
leasing program.
                               number one
    It's a common principle in economic development that private 
investment follows public investment. Economic developers are always 
mindful to steer capital in a fashion that will catalyze further 
investment from the private sector. Hot Springs National Park's 
Bathhouse Row along the eastern side of Central Avenue, is a 
significant public institution that is uniquely intertwined with the 
city of Hot Springs' historic downtown district on the western side of 
Central Ave., where the vast majority of the land and improved property 
is privately owned.
    Prior to the bathhouse leasing program, the majority of the eight 
bathhouses along Bathhouse Row sat empty, dark and vacant. Since the 
leasing program has filled these bathhouses with new businesses, the 
eastern national park side of the street has come alive with activity.
    Instead of shouldering the burden of the full capital outlay to 
open these structures to the public, Hot Springs National Park 
solicited business ideas from the private sector that would put this 
real estate back into productive use, reactivate the square footage, 
and finance the final property improvements privately. The only 
compromise that the national park has had to make, is to allow 
businesses to fill these spaces that sell a product or service that is 
not identical to the thermal bathing of 100 years ago for which these 
structures were built.
    When these bathhouses were built 100 years ago, before the 
invention of penicillin, thermal bathing was a popular treatment for 
many illnesses. The demand for bathing has decreased significantly 
since that day and caused most of the bathing businesses in the 
bathhouses to close by the 1980s.
    The bathhouse leasing arrangement has allowed the public 
institution to offload the ideation and capital investment needed to 
put this property back to work to the private sector while still 
retaining oversight of the land, real estate and business.
    It's also important to consider the genesis of the Bathhouse 
structures themselves. They were built by the private sector on Federal 
land for the purpose of operating as private businesses, so in Hot 
Springs this concessioner concept is over 100 years old.
    This reactivation of public space due to the bathhouse leasing 
program has served as a catalyst for private investment and business 
growth in the City of Hot Springs' downtown historic district, where 
these two areas are so uniquely intertwined. Where nearly all of the 
bathhouses on the eastern side of the street appeared closed and dark, 
they are now open for business. The new businesses that have occupied 
the bathhouses have proved some interesting new markets in Hot Springs 
and set the foundation for a tremendous wave of investment in recent 
years. In downtown over the past 4 years, over 100 new businesses have 
opened, over 80 historic commercial properties have been bought and 
sold, and over $80 million of private capital has been invested. I'm 
sure none of this would have been possible if the Hot Springs National 
Park side of downtown remained ``closed for business.''
    And even better for Hot Springs National Park, instead of a sizable 
public investment, private capital has been used to improve, preserve 
and maintain the bathhouse properties. That capital was attracted by 
the opportunity of the bathhouse leasing program and the unique markets 
that exist in Hot Springs.
                               number two
    The businesses that occupy these bathhouses get an extraordinary 
amount of national and international attention, which pays dividends 
for our community. Due to the unique nature of their business and to a 
certain degree, the uniqueness of the lease with the national park, the 
press loves these businesses.
    The Superior Bathhouse Brewery operates the business on Bathhouse 
Row that is most fundamentally different than the original bathing 
experience; they sell beer that's made with the thermal water from Hot 
Springs National Park. This is a very unique practice. In fact, this is 
the only business making beer with naturally thermal water in the 
world. Because of this unique quality, and because the beer is good, 
Superior gets a remarkable amount media exposure nationwide.
    Just two examples of this type of national coverage in 2016 are 
that Superior was featured on the CBS Sunday Morning Program and in the 
Chicago Tribune. Visit Hot Springs, our city's tourism agency, 
estimates the reach of these two pieces alone at nearly 3 million 
people with a retail advertising value of just over $120,000.
    Additionally, owners of The Quapaw Baths &amp;amp; Spa attended an 
international summit on thermal bathing in Japan representing Hot 
Springs, Arkansas, where they were the only attendees from the United 
States of America.
    This type of national and international coverage is very impactful 
on our local economy, because not only does it promote exciting new 
businesses, the news coverage always introduces Hot Springs as the 
setting for this interesting activity. This equates to great exposure 
from very credible editorial sources that generates tourism for Hot 
Springs.
    Tourism is very important to Hot Springs. It is the largest sector 
in the Hot Springs economy, supporting 7,592 jobs or roughly 22 percent 
of the workforce in our area. Visitors spent $799 million in Hot 
Springs last year.
                              number three
    The Bathhouse Leasing program has a general reputation for being 
onerous and the business owners who have completed the process are 
regarded as exceptionally capable people.
    The average citizen in our community does not know the exact 
specifics and particulars related to completing the bathhouse leasing 
process. But there is a perception among the general population of Hot 
Springs that it is an extremely complicated and lengthy process which 
may deter potential applicants.
    This perception is fueled by the elongated timeline of the process. 
Many of these prospective lessees make very highly visible 
announcements announcing their intent to lease a bathhouse. In many 
cases, years pass by before any tangible progress is seen, either 
through construction or occupation of the real estate. A multiyear 
timeline to open a business is not feasible for most businesses and 
most cannot sustain a business through this period without revenue 
coming in. Other factors are involved in extending the timeline for 
opening with financing being central among them, but the leasing 
process is always the most visible public obstacle.
    The difficulty of this process is magnified when compared to the 
process for leasing a private commercial space just a few dozen feet 
across Central Avenue in the City of Hot Springs' downtown historic 
district. A simple lease agreement between two parties is usually all 
that's needed and in a best-case scenario where the property is ready 
to be occupied, a tenant business could have the opportunity to move in 
within days. This scenario looks more favorable to most businesses, but 
the bathhouses offer the unique benefit of access to the thermal water 
which is important enough for most of the businesses who have leased 
bathhouses to opt for this more difficult lease route.
    This issue is also reflected in the fact that many of the bathhouse 
lessees are highly regarded in our community as having an exceptional 
aptitude for success. These people show extraordinary tenacity in their 
everyday lives and the management and execution of their businesses and 
they exhibit characteristics of extremely competent and successful 
people. Pat McCabe is the Mayor of Hot Springs and has been the CEO of 
Levi Hospital for nearly two decades. Anthony Taylor and Bob Kempkes 
are both accomplished architects, business owners, and real estate 
developers. Rose Schweikhart is an accomplished musician, business 
owner and beer brewer. The fact that only the most exceptional business 
people are holding leases to the bathhouses makes me question the 
ability of the average business owner to see this process through to 
completion.
                               conclusion
    The Bathhouse Leasing Program has had an extremely positive impact 
on Hot Springs and especially the downtown area. What was once an 
entire half of downtown that appeared closed and dark is now open for 
business. The new businesses that have occupied the bathhouses have set 
the foundation for a tremendous wave of investment in recent years. In 
downtown over the past 4 years, over 100 new businesses have opened, 
over 80 historic commercial properties have been bought and sold, and 
over $80 million of private capital has been invested. Many other 
factors were involved in the development of downtown Hot Springs over 
the years, but I'm sure none of this would have been possible if the 
Hot Springs National Park side of downtown remained to appear ``closed 
for business.''

    &lt;option&gt;     AND POLICY, NATIONAL TRUST FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION, 
                         WASHINGTON, DC
    Mr.  Cassidy. Chairman Bishop, members of the Committee, 
Mayor McCabe, and other distinguished guests, I appreciate the 
opportunity to present the National Trust testimony on the 
challenges and successes of historic leasing as a strategy to 
abate the maintenance backlog. But first, Chairman Bishop, on 
behalf of the hundreds of organizations, some of which are here 
today, who support your bipartisan Restore Our Parks and Public 
Lands Act, thank you for successful markup of the legislation 
last Thursday. We look forward to continuing to work with you 
on getting that across the finish line by the end of the year.
    We appreciate the attention you are focusing on historic 
leasing. While leasing is not a magic or silver bullet that 
will solve the backlog, leasing is not the solution to ensure 
that national icons such as the Statue of Liberty, Independence 
Hall are maintained for the American public. And under current 
concessional law, numerous public services that are necessary 
and appropriate to visitation in parks, such as Yosemite and 
Canyonlands, are the appropriate subjects of concession 
contracts. The leasing of historic buildings is an important 
improvement but still an underutilized strategy to rehabilitate 
and bring back to economic life and public enjoyment abandoned 
or underutilized historic resources.
    Hot Springs demonstrates the successes and the continued 
future opportunities. The Trust published a major report on 
historic leasing 5 years ago. It provided an overview of policy 
concerns, legal authorities, recommendations, and case studies 
from parks throughout the country, including Hot Springs. Since 
then, we have visited numerous parks to evaluate existing and 
potential leases and we continue to meet with National Park 
Service leadership to encourage expanded leases. I would note 
that long-term leases of 55 to 60 years enable lessees to 
utilize the Federal historic tax credit, by far the most 
significant investment in historic preservation. But the tax 
credit has been used in only a small number of Park Service 
leases, including the Quapaw Bathhouse, and we hope soon Hale 
and Superior bathhouses.
    So, what are the barriers and how can they be overcome? We 
are impressed and humbled by the remarkable staff of our 
National Park Service. There are few finer interpreters of our 
shared national stories. But little girls and boys who dream of 
being a park ranger, dream of being a ranger in Yosemite or 
Denali, or the smart ones, perhaps Zion, Golden Spike, and Hot 
Springs, And I would venture that very few imagine becoming a 
commercial real estate specialist.
    The fact is there is very little practical experience with 
commercial leasing within the Service either at the park, 
region, or headquarters level. There are a number of 
outstanding real estate professionals, but they are often 
concentrated in individual parks over few regions. They are not 
well distributed throughout the agency.
    And related to this fact is that Park Service practice and 
culture precludes experts in one region from assisting park 
officials in another region, and national staff are reluctant 
to offer advice to parks unless there is a request from the 
region. Our recommendation--and this actually emerged in a 
conversation we had with Acting Director Danny Smith--is that 
the Park Service should commit to catalyze historic leasing by 
creating a ``tiger team'' of real estate specialists 
knowledgeable in park regulations and policies and perhaps, 
most importantly, commercial real estate, to assist individual 
parks and regions in advancing specific projects and innovative 
adaptive reuse partnerships. The Park Service also has to 
provide the financial support to fund the necessary staff 
training.
    We also have opaque guidance from headquarters. In April 
2016, the Park Service issued a memorandum to the regional 
directors that explicitly addressed a bias against leasing, and 
that was an important first step. It included a decision guide 
to choosing a lease or a concession contract, but the 
underlying policies and interpretations remain confusing.
    Speaking personally, I have suffered brain damage trying to 
understand the distinction between necessary and appropriate 
and how that implicates a lease or a concession contract and to 
still find its practical application. One simple recommendation 
is that the Park Service should develop a set of more specific 
examples to describe how existing leases are consistent with 
policy or what would be examples of leases that might violate 
policy, and particular care is needed to ensure there are clear 
standards to determine when a concession agreement is required 
and leasing is appropriate.
    The red light indicates I am done. I would be happy to 
answer any questions, especially on other successful examples 
besides the great ones here in Hot Springs.

    &lt;option&gt;    Prepared Statement of Thomas J. Cassidy, Jr., Vice President of 
     Government Relations and Policy, National Trust for Historic 
                              Preservation
    Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva and members of the 
Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the National Trust 
for Historic Preservation's testimony on the challenges and successes 
of historic leasing as a strategy to bring abandoned and underutilized 
buildings back to public enjoyment and use, while also abating the 
$11.6 billion maintenance backlog of our national parks. My name is 
Thomas J. Cassidy, Jr. and I am the Vice President of Government 
Relations and Policy.
    The National Trust for Historic Preservation is a privately-funded 
charitable, educational and non-profit organization chartered by 
Congress in 1949 in order to ``facilitate public participation in 
historic preservation'' and to further the purposes of Federal historic 
preservation laws.\1\ The intent of Congress was for the National Trust 
``to mobilize and coordinate public interest, participation and 
resources in the preservation and interpretation of sites and 
buildings.'' \2\ The National Trust has more than 1 million members and 
supporters. With headquarters in Washington, DC, 9 field offices, 28 
historic sites, and a national network of partners in states, 
territories, and the District of Columbia, the National Trust takes 
direct, on-the-ground action when historic sites are threatened, 
advocates to save America's heritage, and strives to create a cultural 
legacy that is as diverse as the Nation itself, so all can take pride 
in the American story.

    \2\ S. Rep. No. 1110, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1949).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The National Trust has worked closely with many stakeholders on a 
legislative solution that would provide dedicated funding to address 
the maintenance backlog. We strongly endorse the bipartisan Restore Our 
Parks and Public Lands Act (H.R. 6510) introduced by Chairman Rob 
Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva which enjoys the support of nearly 
160 co-sponsors. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for your successful 
markup of this legislation last Thursday.
    We also support the Restore Our Parks Act (S. 3172) introduced by 
Senators Portman, Warner, Alexander, and King that to-date has secured 
support from over a quarter of the U.S. Senate. We believe these bills 
can make a substantial and meaningful investment in our national parks. 
We are also pleased the legislation provides dedicated funding financed 
by unobligated Federal mineral revenues in such a way that allocations 
to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Historic Preservation Fund 
are not impacted. The National Trust is a strong supporter of both 
these programs and believes that both should receive the dedicated 
funding they have long been promised.
    Thank you for the attention the Committee is focusing on historic 
leasing, an underutilized tool to abate the NPS maintenance backlog. 
Historic leasing is not a magic bullet that will solve the maintenance 
backlog. Leasing to a third party is not the solution to ensure that 
national icons such as the Statue of Liberty, Independence Hall, or the 
Jefferson Memorial are maintained for the American public. And, under 
current concession law, numerous public services that are ``necessary 
and appropriate'' to visitation in many of our large rural parks such 
as the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Great Smoky Mountains, and Yellowstone 
are the appropriate subjects of concession contracts. But, leasing of 
historic buildings in national parks is an important and proven, but 
still underutilized strategy, to rehabilitate and bring back to 
economic life and public enjoyment abandoned or underutilized historic 
resources.
                                the need
    The National Park System is an astonishing national treasure. It is 
absolutely one of our Nation's best ideas--a network of 417 parks and 
sites that protect spectacular historic, cultural, and natural 
resources and tell the stories of remarkable people and events in our 
country's history. Three-quarters of national park units were 
established to protect our country's most important historic and 
cultural resources. These places include such national treasures as 
Ellis Island National Monument, Gettysburg National Battlefield, Chaco 
Cultural National Historic Park, and the Washington Monument. Over the 
past two decades, the NPS has added over 30 new park units that are 
predominantly historical and cultural. These new parks that help tell 
the stories of all Americans include Rosie the Riveter World War II 
Home Front National Historical Park, Cesar E. Chavez National Monument, 
Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site, Reconstruction Era National 
Monument, and the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument.
    The National Park System includes more than 84 million acres across 
all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and many U.S. territories. NPS 
protects and interprets an estimated 2 million archaeological sites, 
4,200 historic statues and monuments and more than 27,000 properties 
listed on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, 
including 9,600 buildings.
    National parks, and the historic and cultural sites they protect, 
are some of our Nation's most popular attractions and were visited by 
over 331 million people last year. In 2017 alone, these visits 
generated visitor spending of an estimated $18.2 billion in nearby 
communities--spending that supported 306,000 jobs and provided a $35.8 
billion boost to the national economy.
    I will address two issues in this testimony. First, the need for 
direct Federal investments through annual appropriations and the 
proposed ``National Park Service and Public Lands Legacy Restoration 
Fund.'' Second, the challenges and opportunities available to 
rehabilitate and maintain historic properties through historic leasing.
                       direct federal investments
    The NPS maintenance backlog of $11.6 billion demonstrates that 
additional investments and new strategies are necessary if NPS is to 
meet its stewardship responsibilities. We are encouraged, Mr. Chairman, 
by your successful markup last Thursday of H.R. 6510. We are impressed 
by the many statements of support by numerous Senators, Secretary of 
the Interior Ryan Zinke, and hundreds of organizations nationwide for 
reducing the maintenance backlog and prioritizing this issue as part of 
policy proposals to invest in our Nation's infrastructure.
    For several years the National Trust has focused on increased 
funding for the NPS line items for Repair and Rehabilitation and Cyclic 
Maintenance to alleviate the maintenance backlog and ensure adequate 
preservation and protection of resources in our parks. Both the House 
and Senate-passed versions of the FY19 Interior Appropriations bills 
would increase funding for these two accounts. The Senate bill adds $15 
million while the House bill increases those accounts by $40 million 
compared with FY18. Notably, the FY18 total for these accounts was 
already about $100 million more than it was just 3 years prior--a 
roughly 55 percent increase. We support continued increases in 
appropriations for these accounts.
    But the scale of the backlog demonstrates the need for a reliable, 
dedicated Federal funding source distinct from annual appropriations to 
address the deferred maintenance backlog. And, if we are successful in 
securing enactment of the Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act, we 
will also need to be mindful of the need to provide sufficient staffing 
to preserve properly historic sites, maintain buildings and 
infrastructure in safe condition, and keep our parks open and 
accessible to the public.
                            historic leasing
    The National Trust published a major report in September 2013: 
``Historic Leasing in the National Park System: Preserving History 
Through Effective Partnerships.'' \3\ Our study provided an overview of 
policy concerns, legal authorities, policy recommendations, and a set 
of 17 case studies from throughout the country. Since then, we have 
visited numerous parks to evaluate successful leases and opportunities 
to expand leasing. We have updated 4 of our case studies and expect to 
complete 4 more in the near future, a number of which are summarized 
below. We have also continued to meet with National Park Service 
leadership and Congressional staff to encourage additional use of 
historic leasing.

History Through Effective Partnerships; http://forum.savingplaces.org/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Leasing of historic buildings in the National Park System to non-
NPS entities is an effective and proven public-private partnership that 
can be used as part of a suite of options to abate the deferred 
maintenance backlog in our national parks. Historic leases alleviate 
the burden on the National Park Service to maintain historic buildings. 
Long-term commercial leases of 55-60 years also enable lessees to 
utilize the Federal 20 percent historic tax credit for qualified 
rehabilitation expenses. We were very pleased that Congress chose to 
maintain the historic tax credit (HTC), championed by President Ronald 
Reagan, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The HTC has proven to be 
the most significant Federal investment in historic preservation. Since 
1982, it has rehabilitated more than 43,000 buildings, creating 2.4 
million jobs and leveraging $131 billion in private investment. As 
described below, the HTC has been used in only a small number of NPS 
leases, including at the Quapaw Bath House here in Hot Springs. We know 
that it can and should be used more extensively than it is now.
    Congressional support for leasing has long existed, as evidenced by 
grants of authority to enter into leases and historic leases,\4\ which 
Congress has extended to the NPS over the years. In addition, there has 
been consistent direction from the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee 
and Full Committee encouraging historic leases to abate the maintenance 
backlog. For example, the Interior FY12 House Interior Appropriations 
Report stated:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ See 54 U.S.C., section 102102 and section 306121.
        The Committee encourages the Park Service to pursue the use of 
        cost-effective, innovative solutions like historic leases when 
        practical and when the arrangement comports with a park unit's 
        enabling legislation. These solutions can help mitigate a 
        growing backlog of historic structures in need of 
        preservation.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ House Report 112-51, H.R. 2584.

    In FY16, the Full Committee stated:
        Leasing of Historic Buildings. Leasing of historic park 
        buildings has proven to be an effective public-private 
        partnership that has brought private investment to the repair 
        and maintenance of historic park resources. In previous years, 
        the Committee has encouraged the Service to make expanded use 
        of leasing authority. The Committee commends the Service for 
        recent steps it has taken to increase the utilization of this 
        tool, including establishing a leasing manager to oversee and 
        expand the historic leasing program. The Committee directs the 
        Service to provide a report, within 6 months of enactment of 
        this Act, detailing its progress toward expanding use of this 
        authority. Included in this report should be (1) an assessment 
        of how many historic structures are leasable, (2) the cost of 
        undertaking a leasing program, and (3) any statutory or 
        regulatory impediments that now inhibit the enhanced use of 
        leasing of historic structures.\6\

        buildings has proven to be an effective public-private 
        partnership that has brought private investment to the repair

        utilization of this tool, including establishing a leasing 
        manager to oversee and expand the historic leasing program. The 
        Committee renews its previous request that directs the Service 
        to provide a report, within 6 months of enactment of this Act, 
        detailing its progress toward expanding use of this authority. 
        Included in this report should be (1) a list of structures the 
        Service considers high-priority candidates for leasing, (2) a 
        list of structures currently under a lease arrangement, (3) an 
        estimate of the number of leases that have enabled private 
        sector investments using the Service-administered historic tax

    The Department of the Interior, responding to the FY17 report 
language, reported to Chairman Calvert on January 18, 2017,\8\ that 
among the 27,000 assets on the List of Classified Structures (LCS), 
potentially 9,000 structures could be evaluated for re-use through 
leasing. And in a letter to Chairman Murkowski of March 29, 2018, the 
Department identified 47 high-priority candidates for leasing, about 
350 structures currently subject to a lease, and 3 leases that utilize 
the historic tax credit.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ The letter is date stamped ``Jan 18 2016'' but we believe it is 
a 2017 letter.
    \9\ We understand there are at least five current historic tax 
credit projects including within the following parks: Hot Springs, Fort 
Hancock, San Francisco Maritime, Fort Baker (GGNRA) and Fort Mason 
(GGNRA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barriers to Leasing and Policy Recommendations:
    Historic leasing can enhance opportunities for the private and non-
profit sector to assist in the preservation, maintenance and use of 
historic buildings. Even with the availability of leasing authority 
included in the National Historic Preservation Act and the Concessions 
Management Act, and congressional encouragement, the NPS has struggled 
to fully use its authority to preserve historic structures and cultural 
resources. Barriers to full use of this authority--including unduly 
restrictive policy interpretations or statutory and regulatory hurdles, 
as well as staff capacity and expertise--have often stood in the way. 
If implemented, the following recommendations would help address these 
barriers and make historic leasing an even more effective tool.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Lack of capacity and experience in the field: After many 
            years of studying the use of historic leasing in the parks 
            and meeting with park staff on the ground, in regional 
            offices and in DC, we are impressed and humbled by the 
            remarkable staff of the National Park Service. There are 
            few finer interpreters of our shared national stories. But, 
            there is very little practical experience with commercial 
            leasing within the Service, either at the park, region or 
            headquarters level. There are a number of examples of 
            outstanding real estate professionals, but they are often 
            concentrated in individual parks or a few regions--they are 
            not well-distributed throughout the agency.
          --  Recommendation: NPS should commit to significantly 
        catalyze historic leasing by creating a ``tiger team'' of real 
        estate specialists, knowledgeable in park service regulations 
        and policies and perhaps most importantly, commercial real 
        estate, to assist individual parks and regions in advancing 
        specific projects and innovative adaptive reuse partnerships.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Internal Culture and Policy: Existing park service policy 
            and culture precludes experts in one region from assisting 
            park officials in another region. In addition, national 
            staff is reluctant to offer advice to parks unless there is 
            a request from the region. And, park service leadership has 
            not yet broken through these barriers to make clear that 
            expanded use of historic leasing is a National Park Service 
            priority that will be supported by policy clarifications, 
            small but necessary budget reforms and spotlighting 
            successful models of innovation.
          --  Recommendation: NPS should provide financial support to 
        fund staff training and administration of a larger leasing 
        program. Subsequent to our 2013 report, the NPS did add its 
        first leasing program specialist in the Washington office, and 
        we understand that additional capacity is being considered. In 
        many parks, more technical skills are needed before a more 
        robust leasing program can be implemented. The ``tiger team'' 
        identified above would also address this.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Opaque Guidance: On April 18, 2016, the NPS Chief 
            Financial Officer issued a Memorandum to the Regional 
            Directors on ``Guidance on Authorizing Commercial Services 
            under Concession Contracts or Leases.'' It explicitly 
            addressed a bias against leasing based upon a policy 
            interpretation, which is an important policy statement. And 
            it does include a ``Decision Guide--Choosing a Lease or a 
            Concession Contract.'' However, the underlying policies and 
            interpretations remain opaque. Speaking personally, I have 
            invested significant time trying to understand the 
            ``necessary and appropriate'' requirement for a concession 
            contract rather than a lease and still find its practical 
            application, and guidance, to be a challenge.
          --  Recommendation: NPS should develop a set of more specific 
        examples to describe how existing leases are consistent with 
        policy or what would be examples of leases that would violate 
        policy. The NPS should undertake a thorough review of the laws, 
        regulations, policies, and procedures for historic leasing and 
        address inconsistencies and areas of confusion. Particular care 
        is needed to insure that there are clear standards to determine 
        when a concession agreement is required and when leasing is 
        appropriate.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The costs of preparing properties for leasing, including 
            appraisals, is often cited as a barrier.
          --  Recommendation: A fund should be available to prepare 
        buildings for lease, including necessary historic building 
        surveys, costs of appraisals and, in some cases, funds to 
        stabilize and complete basic improvements to structures. The 
        NPS should define the need for such funding and include it in 
        the FY20 budget request.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Administrative Costs: The authority for ``leasing'' 
            permits rental payments to be deposited in a special 
            account for various uses, but not for the costs of 
            administration. The proceeds of a ``historic lease,'' 
            however, are deposited in a fund and may be used for the 
            costs of administration, but the fund is only 2 year money.
          --  Recommendation: Harmonize these sections and permit lease 
        funds to be used for administration without a 2 year limitation 
        on expenditures.
    Despite these obstacles, there are numerous examples where historic 
leasing and public-private partnership agreements have been used to 
authorize non-Federal entities to operate businesses, provide services 
and housing, and manage event spaces in historic structures within the 
National Park System. In many cases, the involvement of non-Federal 
entities has meant the difference between preservation and reuse or 
deterioration and neglect of irreplaceable historic resources. The 
American public has directly benefited from these private investments 
through increased opportunities to enjoy historic properties that 
otherwise would have been unavailable. However, despite successful 
examples of historic leasing being used to rehabilitate historic 
structures in almost every NPS region, some Superintendents have not 
used the NPS's leasing authorities to their full extent.
                      examples of historic leasing
Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas
    Every year 1.5 million people visit ``The American Spa'' in Hot 
Springs, Arkansas. In the late 19th century, developers turned this 
area and its 47 geothermal springs into a resort town complete with 
hotels and bathhouses. The bathhouses fell into disuse as public 
interest in therapeutic baths declined. In order to restore the eight 
remaining bathhouses to make them both usable and important for 
interpretation, the park explored historic leasing opportunities. An 
initial Federal investment of $18 million in the early 2000s made the 
bathhouses ``tenant-ready'' and attractive to lessees. Today, only one 
bathhouse remains to be leased. Since becoming a unit of the National 
Park System in 1921, the park has remained a major economic driver to 
the city of Hot Springs and draws more than $99 million in tourist 
dollars to local communities.
Quapaw Bathhouse
    The Quapaw--one of the largest bathhouses--had been vacant since 
the 1980s until Taylor Kempkes Architects stepped in. An initial $2.5 
million investment, aided by the historic tax credit, and a year of 
rehabilitation work, led to the reopening of the Quapaw as a luxury spa 
in 2008, and it remains popular a decade later. As part of the 55-year 
lease, the NPS is no longer responsible for monthly utility bills or 
maintenance costs and 2 percent of annual gross revenue must be put 
into a restricted fund for maintenance work. Quapaw Bath and Spa 
handles the daily maintenance operations of the building, yet the park 
remains an active partner by ensuring that any work is consistent with 
National Park Service standards.
Superior Bathhouse
    Aspiring brewer and entrepreneur Rose Schweikhart discovered the 
natural temperature and pH of the thermal springs were ideal for beer 
making. She subsequently turned the Superior Bathhouse into a beer-
making facility, improving the floors and electric conduits to 
accommodate thousands of pounds of equipment, pumps, and food 
facilities. She added features--like a glass wall so visitors could see 
the beer-making process--without harming the historic fabric. Using the 
same lease structure as the Quapaw, Schweikhart maintains the integrity 
of the building while staying economically viable. The Superior 
Bathhouse Brewery opened in 2014 and designs for a German-style beer 
garden are in the works.
Valley Forge National Historical Park, Pennsylvania
    After a harsh winter in Valley Forge, the Continental Army emerged 
from their encampment in June 1778 a more united and disciplined 
fighting force. This defining moment in the American Revolution 
motivated civic groups to host rallies and lead preservation efforts 
until Valley Forge became Pennsylvania's first state park in 1893. When 
suburban development pressures and funding concerns at the state level 
threatened the integrity of the park, the commonwealth transferred the 
management of the park to the National Park Service (NPS) in time for 
the bicentennial in 1976. Each year more than 2.4 million visitors come 
to the park and spend approximately $30 million in local communities. 
To meet increased visitors' demands and to help compensate for 
insufficient Federal appropriations, the NPS has pursued historic 
leasing opportunities. The park utilizes both long- and short-term 
leases, and a multi-year plan enables the NPS to identify future 
leasing projects that benefit the park through additional revenue 
streams, capital improvements, and maintenance savings.
Philander Chase Knox Estate
    The late 18th-century Philander Chase Knox Estate sits 
picturesquely amidst the rolling hills of Valley Forge. The mansion was 
used as a library and storage facility until a 10-year lease was signed 
in 2015 with Valley Forge Park Events, LLC--a partnership between The 
Party Center and Robert Ryan Catering--to create an event space. The 
company preserved the historic integrity of the house and landscape 
while completing necessary updates and restorations. The park receives 
a percentage of the revenue from fees and catering sales at the more 
than 50 annual events, far exceeding initial forecasts. In this 
partnership, the park uses half of the house as a library while the 
event company maintains the indoor and outdoor spaces it leases. The 
beautifully restored mansion is now accessible to the public and guests 
can enjoy scenic views that will inspire them to return to the park.
The Montessori Children's House of Valley Forge
    The Montessori Children's House was seeking a permanent home when 
they learned the park was interested in leasing several historic 
buildings. Following a capital campaign, archaeological and historic 
surveys, and architectural planning, the Montessori Children's House 
signed a 40-year lease in 2009 and began rehabilitating the structures. 
The large house, two-story barn, and cottage were in serious disrepair 
from water damage, unchecked ivy, wood decay, mold, and asbestos. The 
school's repair work preserved the historic integrity of key structures 
and maintained the basic footprint of the site. The park and the school 
forged a symbiotic relationship wherein the park benefits from annual 
rent, mortgage, and maintenance payments while the school enjoys use of 
a beautiful property in a historic setting, with access to park rangers 
for educational programming.
Golden Gate National Recreation Area, California
    One of the largest urban parks in the world, Golden Gate National 
Recreation Area protects significant historic, cultural, natural, 
scenic, and recreational resources. In addition to rich natural 
ecosystems and habitats, the park interprets thousands of years of 
human history from Native American cultures, to the frontiers of the 
Spanish Empire, to American maritime and military heritage, to the 
development of modern-day San Francisco. Established in 1972, the park 
manages more than 366 historic structures, 5 National Historic Landmark 
districts, and 13 National Register of Historic Places properties. 
Every year, more than 15.6 million visitors are drawn to the diverse 
experiences offered at the park and spend approximately $392.1 million 
in local communities. To better steward the historic buildings, the 
park began to enter into formal historic lease agreements in the early 
2000s. Now the park has approximately 30 leasing partners who help to 
maintain and fund the park while creating new opportunities for 
visitors.
Fort Mason Center for Arts &amp;amp; Culture
    Intermittently over the past 200 years, Spanish, Mexican, and 
American forces have fortified this hilltop promontory overlooking the 
San Francisco Bay. Renamed Fort Mason in 1882, the post became 
incorporated into the park when it was established in 1972. After 40 
years of partnering with a local non-profit, the park signed a 60-year 
lease in 2006 with the Fort Mason Center for Arts &amp;amp; Culture (FMCAC). 
The lessee pays an annual rent to the park and also contributes to a 
maintenance reserve fund, where they far exceed their minimum 
requirement every year. As part of the lease, the park is financially 
responsible for shoring up the substructure of the piers and FMCAC 
develops the superstructure. After identifying a for-profit investor, 
FMCAC used the historic tax credit to tack Pier 2 and is now looking to 
rehabilitate Pier 3. FMCAC has subleased many of its buildings to other 
non-profits and for-profit entities to create a thriving campus for the 
arts. The campus--which includes five buildings on land and two pier 
buildings--now hosts five theaters, two art schools, an art supply 
shop, a bookstore, a cafe, and two restaurants.
Golden Gate NRA Residential Master Lease
    To build on this success, the NPS entered the Golden Gate National 
Recreation Area Residential Master Lease with Gaetani Real Estate in 
2013. The 10-year master lease includes buildings at Fort Mason 
(including Officer's Row), Fort Barry, and Point Bonita totaling more 
than 110,00 square feet. Gaetani has currently rehabilitated and leased 
out 30 housing units. As part of the lease, the NPS makes 71.5 percent 
of the gross revenue and an additional 20 percent of revenue is added 
to a repair and maintenance reserve that is nearly expended annually. 
In less than 5 years, more than $10 million was paid to NPS in rent and 
an additional $3.25 million was used to repair, maintain, and preserve 
the historic properties.
Cavallo Point Lodge at Fort Baker
    Built in 1905 as a U.S. Army post, Fort Baker was the largest 
military post added to the park in 2002. When the park became 
interested in leasing the space, the Fort Baker Retreat Group--an 
ambitious partnership between Passport Resorts, Equity Community 
Buildings, and Ajax Capital Group--signed a 60-year lease in 2006 with 
a goal of preserving the fort and rehabilitating it into a hotel and 
retreat center. The scale of the restoration and the length of the 
lease allowed the lessee to use the historic tax credit, which was a 
critical investment component of the project. The Fort Baker Retreat 
Group preserved 29 historic buildings and built 14 new ones in a green 
fashion, making the hotel at Golden Gate the first national park lodge 
with a LEED Gold certification. In addition to paying an amortized base 
rent, the lessee also spends around $1 million annually to maintain the 
premises, which includes 198,000 square feet of buildings within a 30-
acre historic landscape. Now a destination spot, the Cavallo Point 
Lodge offers historic accommodations, cooking classes, a luxury spa, 
and event spaces.
San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park, California
    The Argonaut Hotel is another exemplary leasing example in the 
Pacific West Region. The hotel is located in the century-old Haslett 
Warehouse within the San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park. 
Under a 60-year lease, this one-time fish cannery is now open to the 
public as a hotel. The rehabilitated historic building includes the 
park's Visitor Center on site. The length of the lease term allowed the 
hotel operators to qualify for Federal historic tax credits that made 
the building's rehabilitation financially feasible. Without the 
investment of private funds, and the utilization of the Federal 
historic tax credit, it is likely that these beautifully restored 
buildings would be sitting unused.
Gateway National Recreation Area, New York/New Jersey
    For centuries, the safest way to sail into New York Harbor was by 
hugging the shore of Sandy Hook. From the colonial period to the cold 
war, Sandy Hook lighted the paths of seafarers and protected the city 
from potential attack and invasion. In 1895, the U.S. Army renamed the 
fortifications Fort Hancock and developed an installation that grew to 
7,000 people by the 1940s. Decommissioned in 1974, Fort Hancock became 
part of the Sandy Hook unit of Gateway National Recreation Area. Today, 
Gateway interprets America's largest port, its oldest surviving 
lighthouse, and its first municipal airport. Time and harsh coastal 
conditions have caused severe deferred maintenance. With 110 historic 
military buildings at Fort Hancock alone, the park has looked to 
leasing opportunities. The first lease rehabilitated a deteriorating 
property and signaled the adaptive re-use potential of some 35 nearby 
buildings at the Sandy Hook unit, which receives roughly 2.2 million 
visitors annually.
Sandy Hook Chapel
    Among the officers' homes, army barracks, and mess halls, the Sandy 
Hook Chapel--built in 1941--is a relatively new addition to the main 
post at Fort Hancock. Occupying a unique location at the end of the 
Sandy Hook Bay, the church had fallen into serious disrepair by the 
late 1990s. At that point, the NPS made an ongoing commitment to 
preserve and protect the structure, and it was one of the very few 
buildings successfully rehabilitated during the 1990's-era leasing 
program. Now rehabilitated as an event space, the historic Sandy Hook 
Chapel is available for short-term rentals for weddings, meetings, 
family gathers, memorials, and other occasions. The park maintains the 
structure and grounds and manages the books, while the lessee is 
responsible for other event costs. This investment realizes 
substantial, ongoing revenue for the NPS. Now fully booked, the park is 
accepting reservations for dates in 2020.
Duplex Family Housing Quarters/Building #21
    The iconic yellow brick buildings comprising Officer's Row at Fort 
Hancock were constructed largely between 1898-1910. Originally built to 
house officers and their families, today many of these buildings are 
abandoned and face serious maintenance challenges. About 5 years ago, 
the park created the Fort Hancock 21st Century Federal Advisory 
Committee, dedicated to preserving these deteriorating buildings. In 
2016, the park entered its first lease. The 60-year agreement enabled 
the investors to use the historic tax credit, and the duplex is now 
available for short-term rentals year-round. The park benefits by 
saving a deteriorating historic structure that will now be maintained 
and returned to productive public use. Since then, the park has 
executed formal Letters of Intent for 13 buildings at Fort Hancock with 
individuals and organizations with plans to rehabilitate those 
buildings.
Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Ohio
    Originally designated as a National Recreation Area in 1974, 
Cuyahoga Valley National Park protects a restored landscape with deep 
cultural roots. Surrounded by cities like Cleveland and Akron, Ohio, 
scenic Cuyahoga Valley provides historical, educational, natural, and 
recreational opportunities for its neighbors as well as its more far-
flung visitors. The park includes hundreds of cultural assets including 
part of the Ohio &amp;amp; Erie Canal, railways, historic communities and 
districts, and old farms. Recognizing the importance of preserving 
these historic sites but limited by staffing and funding, the park 
turned to historic leasing and developed two programs: the 
``Countryside Initiative,'' which focuses on leasing historic farms, 
and; the ``Historic Property Leasing Program,'' which repurposes 
historic buildings for events, accommodations, and other uses. Farm 
leases in particular allow for the preservation of important rural 
historic resources, put farmlands back into production, create 
opportunities for entrepreneurial farmers, and teach visitors about 
where their food comes from. Today, the park holds 15 leases--including 
11 for farms--and is exploring opportunities to encourage more leasing. 
In 2017, more than 2.2 million visitors explored Cuyahoga Valley and 
spent more than $78.1 million in local gateway communities.
Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park, Georgia
    To preserve the historic character of Auburn Avenue, and the block 
of historic houses that includes the Birth Home of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., the NPS established the Martin Luther King, Jr. National 
Historic Site in 1980. The park encompasses 38 acres in the Old Fourth 
Ward neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. Dr. King's Birth Home is open to 
visitors. The NPS funds the maintenance for all of the federally-owned 
houses within the park unit with revenue generated by leasing 29 of the 
federally-owned historic buildings for private residential purposes. 
These structures include apartments, duplexes and single family homes. 
The leasing program has been very popular, leading to the establishment 
of a waiting list for potential tenants.
    In addition to the private residential leases, another federally-
owned building is operated as a commercial barber shop, and the 
remaining homes are used for park employee housing or by park partner 
organizations under cooperative agreements, including the Martin Luther 
King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change and the historic Ebenezer 
Baptist Church. The nearly $200,000 in annual rental revenue collected 
through these rental agreements is used to perform major maintenance 
and restoration in the historic district while the lessees are 
individually responsible for funding routine maintenance.
    We have made two site visits to this park. We believe that the 
existing leasing arrangement might be modified to include a master 
lease, as has been done for multiple properties at First State National 
Historical Park and GGNRA. This would free NPS staff to focus on other 
visitor centered activities. In addition, we think that there are very 
real possibilities for utilization of long-term leases that could 
utilize the historic tax credit to create modest bed and breakfast 
lodgings.
                               conclusion
    The American people love their national parks. Our national 
character and heritage are defined in many of the places entrusted to 
the care of the NPS, one of the nation's finest institutions.
    As the Committee knows from its work on the maintenance backlog, 
there is a significant need and a set of complex financial, 
institutional, and political challenges that must be overcome if the 
aspirational charge of the National Park Service's Organic Act, enacted 
nearly a century ago, is to be fulfilled.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to present the National Trust's 
perspectives on these issues, and we look forward to working with the 
Committee and other stakeholders as you consider policy proposals to 
address the deferred maintenance backlog. We hope that this hearing 
will encourage the National Park Service to catalyze greater 
utilization of historic leasing throughout our park system. We are 
confident that the leasing of more underutilized historic buildings 
will sustain our Nation's rich heritage of cultural and historic 
resources and generate economic vitality for communities throughout the 
Nation.
                                 ______
   Questions Submitted for the Record by Chairman Bishop to Mr. Tom 
  Cassidy, Vice President, Government Relations and Policy, National 
                    Trust for Historic Preservation
    Question 1. Do you continue to believe that all of the 12 priority 
parks you mentioned in the November 13, 2013 letter to the NPS should 
remain in the priority category? In your oral testimony you indicated 
that the NTHP has visited many parks that appropriate for historic 
leasing. Can you identify which parks the NTHP has investigated further 
and what the results of those visits has been? Have you visited any of 
the parks on the November 13, 2013 list?
    Answer. We do believe that many of the parks mentioned in our 
November 21, 2013 letter should continue to be identified as 
priorities. As identified below, there are several parks for which we 
have no updates. The parks that we have visited since our November 21, 
2013 letter include:
a. Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area
    I do not presently recall if my visit there was before or after our 
letter, but under any circumstance there are a significant number of 
historic buildings that await rehabilitation. A significant challenge 
here--and elsewhere--is to identify a particular adaptive such as a B&amp;amp;B 
or agricultural use that is economically viable.
b. Harpers Ferry National Historical Park
    I visited this park earlier this year and visited both the Murphy's 
Farm site and a large stabilized barn near Bolivar Heights and the 
``Nash-Randolph Wildlife Sanctuary.'' Both buildings would appear to be 
obvious sites for adaptive reuse, including potentially as a B&amp;amp;B or 
event site. There are also vacant buildings formerly part of Storer 
College and other buildings in the park that could be leased.
c. Valley Forge National Historical Park
    We have visited this park. The Philander Knox House has been 
productively leased as an event space since our letter. There are 
numerous potential opportunities here that park staff have identified. 
We are optimistic that this is a park where continued successes will be 
found.
d. Cumberland Island National Seashore
    We have not visited this park. But, we continue to believe that 
there are several buildings in the Dungeness Historic District that 
could be leased. The reluctance to enter into a lease agreement with a 
former life-tenant may have foreclosed a real opportunity for an 
effective public-private partnership for adaptive reuse.
e. Chesapeake &amp;amp; Ohio Canal National Historical Park
    We have visited portions of this very linear park. We understand 
that unreasonably long negotiations for a historic lease with the 
Washington Canoe Club may soon be completed. We understand there 
continue to be effective short-term cooperative agreements for the use 
of particular lock houses. We know of interest to enter into longer 
term leases on at least one potential commercial venue.
f. Sandy Hook Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area
    We have visited this park and will soon publish an updated case 
study.
        Sandy Hook Chapel
        Among the officers' homes, army barracks, and mess halls, the 
        Sandy Hook Chapel--built in 1941--is a relatively new addition 
        to the main post at Fort Hancock. It was one of the very few 
        buildings successfully rehabilitated during the 1990s-era 
        leasing program. Now rehabilitated as an event space, the 
        historic Sandy Hook Chapel is available for short-term rentals 
        for weddings, meetings, family gathers, memorials, and other 
        occasions. Now fully booked, the park is accepting reservations 
        for dates in 2020.
        Duplex Family Housing Quarters/Building #21
        The iconic yellow brick buildings comprising Officer's Row at 
        Fort Hancock were constructed largely between 1898-1910. About 
        5 years ago, the park created the Fort Hancock 21st Century 
        Federal Advisory Committee, dedicated to preserving these 
        deteriorating buildings. In 2016, the park entered into a 60-
        year lease that has enabled investors to use the historic tax 
        credit to restore the building and successfully use it for 
        short-term rentals year-round. The park benefits by saving a 
        deteriorating historic structure that will now be maintained 
        and returned to productive public use. Since then, we 
        understand the park has executed formal Letters of Intent with 
        individuals and organizations with plans to rehabilitate an 
        additional 13 buildings.
g. Apostle Islands National Lakeshore
    We visited the Lakeshore last August and visited several of the 
historically significant properties. We also met with local 
organizations interested in historic preservation and partnership 
opportunities. Among the National Register buildings now eligible for 
historic leasing are the West Bay Club on Sand Island and the Hadland 
and Benson Cabins in the Rocky Island Historic District. These 
properties have already been the subject of community-based volunteer 
restoration efforts or proposals, that were, or are proposed to be, 
undertaken without Federal funding. Some of the lighthouses also might 
be opportunities for historic leasing. Many of the historic buildings 
that are under retained rights through life estates are currently well-
maintained by the historic use families. Future historic leases or 
similar arrangements could be important tools to ensure these 
properties are maintained after the expiration of the use and occupancy 
rights and before they become part of the maintenance backlog.
h. Cuyahoga Valley National Park
    We have not visited this park, but we have interviewed NPS staff 
and are preparing to publish a case study.
    Originally designated as a National Recreation Area in 1974, 
Cuyahoga Valley National Park protects a restored landscape with deep 
cultural roots. The park includes hundreds of cultural assets including 
part of the Ohio &amp;amp; Erie Canal, railways, historic communities and 
districts, and old farms. Recognizing the importance of preserving 
these historic sites but limited by staffing and funding, the park 
turned to historic leasing and developed two programs: the 
``Countryside Initiative,'' which focuses on leasing historic farms, 
and the ``Historic Property Leasing Program,'' which repurposes 
historic buildings for events, accommodations, and other uses. Farm 
leases in particular allow for the preservation of important rural 
historic resources, put farmlands back into production, create 
opportunities for entrepreneurial farmers, and teach visitors about 
where their food comes from. Today, the park holds 15 leases--including 
11 for farms --and is exploring opportunities to encourage more 
leasing.
i. New River Gorge National River
    We have no updates.
j. Glacier National Park
    We understand that a number of the potential lease properties near 
Lake McDonald were damaged or destroyed by the most recent fire.
k. Grand Canyon National Park
    We have no updates.
l. North Cascades National Park
    We have no updates.
Other parks we have visited to evaluate leasing opportunities include:
Hot Springs National Park
    Those of us who participated in the Committee's September 17 field 
hearing in Hot Springs were able to experience firsthand the enormous 
impact that historic leasing--and the Federal historic tax credit--have 
had in the park and the surrounding community.
    We were able to directly see firsthand the community and economic 
impacts of leasing in restoring the Quapaw and Superior bathhouses and 
the ongoing work at the Hale Bathhouse. We also saw the need for a 
successful leading project to revitalize the Maurice Bathhouse.
    In addition to bringing abandoned properties to life, the existing 
leases of the Quapaw and Superior result in private lessees assuming 
the financial responsibility of rehabilitating and maintaining the 
buildings, paying utility bills and returning revenues to the park.
First State National Historical Park
    This park provides an outstanding example of creative regional and 
park staff entering into a master lease of at least 14 buildings that 
enabled existing residential and agricultural uses to continue. The 
small staff of this new park would never have had the capacity to 
administer these properties without the use of a master lease. The 
master lease provides centralized property management by a 3rd party 
while also addressing responsibilities for deferred maintenance and 
lease revenue to the park.
Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA)
    The San Francisco Bay area continues to benefit from historic 
leasing. Our 2013 report highlighted the use of the historic tax credit 
to revitalize the Inn at Cavallo Point/Fort Baker and the Argonaut 
Hotel/San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park.
        Fort Mason
        Historic leasing has continued at Fort Mason within GGNRA. 
        After 40 years of partnering with a local non-profit, the park 
        signed a 60-year lease in 2006 with the Fort Mason Center for 
        Arts &amp;amp; Culture (FMCAC). The lessee pays an annual rent to the 
        park and also contributes to a maintenance reserve fund, where 
        they far exceed their minimum requirement every year. As part 
        of the lease, the park is financially responsible for shoring 
        up the substructure of the piers and FMCAC develops the 
        superstructure. After identifying a for-profit investor, FMCAC 
        used the historic tax credit to address issues at Pier 2 and is 
        now looking to rehabilitate Pier 3. FMCAC has subleased many of 
        its buildings to other non-profits and for-profit entities to 
        create a thriving campus for the arts. The campus--which 
        includes five buildings on land and two pier buildings--now 
        hosts five theaters, two art schools, an art supply shop, a 
        bookstore, a cafe, and two restaurants.
        Golden Gate NRA Residential Master Lease
        The NPS entered the Golden Gate National Recreation Area 
        Residential Master Lease with Gaetani Real Estate in 2013. The 
        10-year master lease includes buildings at Fort Mason 
        (including Officer's Row), Fort Barry, and Point Bonita 
        totaling more than 110,00 square feet. Gaetani has currently 
        rehabilitated and leased out 30 housing units. As part of the 
        lease, significant revenue is returned to NPS and to a repair 
        and maintenance reserve that is nearly expended annually. In 
        less than 5 years, more than $10 million was paid to NPS in 
        rent and an additional $3.25 million was used to repair, 
        maintain, and preserve the historic properties.
Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore
    We have also visited Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The historic 
assets that are best known at this park are the five homes which were a 
part of the Century of Progress International Exposition for the 1933-
34 World's Fair in Chicago. Preservation non-profit Indiana Landmarks 
partnered with the National Park Service to lease all five houses, four 
of which are subleased to private residents. The House of Tomorrow 
remains, and Indiana Landmarks plans to restore and lease the house on 
a short-term basis in the future.
Isle Royale National Park
    We have visited this park. Like Apostles Island National Lakeshore 
and Cumberland Island National Seashore there are many historic sites 
maintained by life-tenants who owned their property before the 
establishment of the park. We recommend that the NPS give serious 
consideration toward developing a policy to ensure that life-tenants, 
at the end of their tenancy, are eligible to lease the properties they 
have lived in and maintained for many years.
Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Site
    See discussion immediately below.
    Question 2. Do you agree with NPS that there are only 47 priority 
buildings for historic leasing? How would you go about developing such 
a list that is all-inclusive?
    Answer. We have reviewed the March 29, 2018 letter from the Office 
of the Secretary to Chairman Murkowski describing the NPS process in 
identifying the 47 ``High Priority Candidates for Leasing.'' It seems 
like a fine process, but we expect there are multiple other buildings 
that would qualify as high priorities. For example, we have had a 
series of conversations with Martin Luther King National Historical 
Park and the Southeast Regional Office regarding a potential commercial 
B&amp;amp;B opportunity at 497 Auburn Avenue, NE and 493 (A, B &amp;amp; C) Auburn 
Avenue. The SE Region was preparing a ``Request for Expression of 
Interest'' in late 2017. It is our understanding that the Request was 
never formally issued. We do not think that this situation meets the 
criteria in the March 29, 2018 letter. However, we continue to believe 
that the subject property could be a very viable candidate for leasing 
if NPS leadership were to focus commercial real estate expertise from 
other regions and national staff to assist the park and region in 
successfully moving the project forward.
    We do not have a specific recommendation on how to develop an all-
inclusive list and we do not believe that is the most productive 
activity the NPS should undertake at this time. Instead, we would 
recommend, as described more fully below, creating a ``Timer-Team'' to 
identify real-world, commercially viable opportunities and then invest 
the time, resources and leadership necessary to make a growing number 
of individual projects successful.
    Question 3. Do you agree that historic leasing should be used 
proactively to head off the need to even include properties on the 
backlog? It appears NPS has limited its review to properties already on 
the backlog. Is that correct? How would you go about looking more 
broadly for the advance use of historic leasing to keep buildings good 
shape before they decline and become a liability for NPS and the 
Federal budget?
    Answer. From our perspective, the preservation priority is to lease 
underutilized historic structures, many of which are vacant and needing 
rehabilitation funds. Our general sense is that the properties NPS has 
reviewed are already on the backlog, but NPS would be in the better 
position to answer that specific question.
    We have not evaluated the ``advance use'' of leasing to maintain 
buildings before they decline. One exception to consider is discussed 
above in our answer to Question 1 as it relates to the life-estate uses 
at Apostle Islands (and other similar situations like Cumberland Island 
and Isly Royale). There may be instances where that is a viable 
strategy but we have not explored where those opportunities may be 
found. This could be a task for the ``Tiger-Team'' described below.
    One of the benefits of leasing is that a third party, and not the 
NPS, is responsible for the maintenance of the leased building, and 
also the beneficiary of lease payments generating net positive income 
to the agency. In some cases, such as Hot Springs, the NPS has invested 
funds in preparing long abandoned buildings to a condition where third 
parties would be more willing to enter into long-term leases.
    Question 4. Much of the focus of historic leasing to date has been 
to wait for NPS to decide to make a property available for leasing. 
This appears to be a slow and bureaucratic process that is limiting the 
use of this tool. What would you do to create new avenues for getting 
properties onto the list of possible leasing? Do you believe that 
outside parties should be able to propose unsolicited leases? And 
should the full range of potential uses be covered, not just high 
visibility business uses in metropolitan areas?
    Answer. We agree that the existing process is not resulting in a 
critical mass of new successes. There are some successes, and we know 
the agency is working on a number of exciting projects, which is very 
positive, but we believe there could be more. Even if properties were 
on a list, if leasing is not identified as a priority by NPS 
leadership, and if there is not the staff capacity and funding required 
to actually solve the real estate and process challenges that preclude 
the creation of more leases, there is little reason to believe that 
placing a property on a list would result in successfully executing a 
lease.
    We would defer to NPS on the best way to identify how outside 
parties can best catalyze opportunities for successful leases. Perhaps 
proposals from third parties could go to a national team to provide an 
initial assessment of practicality and for those ideas that passed a 
threshold of consistency with park use and potential economic 
viability, the national team could recommend action and provide support 
to the park and region to create a fuller proposal. And, yes, 
absolutely, a full range of uses compatible with the park mission 
should be evaluated, including smaller business and agricultural leases 
in small towns, rural and suburban areas. Existing successes at Hot 
Springs, Valley Forge and Cuyahoga demonstrate the potential.
    Question 5. Your organization has suggested that a ``Tiger Team'' 
of historic leasing experts in the Park Service could be established to 
improve the program. What would a tiger team look like? What function 
would they serve to field staff?
    Answer. The term ``Tiger Team'' arose in a conversation with 
National Park Service leadership as a cost effective and pragmatic 
approach that would address the general lack of successful leasing 
experience throughout the agency. It would also address the significant 
barriers of culture and practice that preclude experts in headquarters 
from reaching out directly to parks to make recommendations on 
successfully pursuing leasing opportunities and, similarly, barriers 
that preclude an expert in one region from reaching out to a park in 
another region.
    Creation of a ``Tiger Team'' would be a tangible expression that 
NPS leadership is committed to expanding the use of historic leasing as 
an agency priority, through a cost-effective approach of applying 
existing expertise to solving commercial real estate challenges beyond 
the experience of most Superintendents and regional staff.
    We are not wedded to any particular model and believe that the NPS 
is in the best position to identify the optimal configuration of a 
small group to effectively implement change. But as we have discussed 
the concept of a ``Tiger Team'' needs to be a small group of 
experienced real estate professionals well-versed in successful 
examples of historic leasing from throughout the NPS, including 
headquarters, select Regions and parks. The team could travel to 
specific parks where leasing opportunities exist and advise 
Superintendents and regions on the best practices to achieve success. 
It could also participate/lead national trainings and workshops focused 
on the keys to overcoming obstacles to achieve success.
    Once high priority properties are identified, a multi-disciplinary 
group similar to the Northeast Regional Roundtable should be assembled 
to evaluate more critically particular proposals, including staff who 
are experts in facilities management, partnerships, leasing/concessions 
and budget.
    However, we are convinced that the most important key to success is 
for NPS leadership to embrace the concept that historic leasing is a 
significant strategy to rehabilitate underutilized buildings for 
visitor enjoyment, to bring new uses to revitalize communities in and 
near specific parks, and to abate the maintenance backlog.

    Mr.  Westerman. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Bob Kempkes for 5 minutes.

    &lt;option&gt;                SPRINGS NATIONAL PARK, ARKANSAS
    Mr.  Kempkes. Thank you all for being here. We really 
appreciate you coming to Hot Springs.
    I think Mr. McCabe has kind of hit on some of the financing 
hurdles that we all face trying to get a bathhouse open, and I 
think Mr. Cassidy's on point with the suggestion of commercial 
real estate specialists.
    A little background. In 2005, we submitted a proposal to 
lease the Quapaw Bathhouse. Our idea at that point in time was 
to provide low-cost access to thermal waters and bathing for 
the general public. Currently that was being provided by the 
Buckstaff Bathhouse in a traditional format, which works well, 
but we thought something maybe a little more updated might be 
well received. We then signed a lease in 2007, so it took a 
couple years to work through all those lease terms. We opened 
our business in 2008.
    We are now in the 11th year of our lease. I am very 
satisfied with our relationship with the National Park Service. 
I would like to mention, as Pat did, Superintendent Fernandez, 
without which we would have never gotten through the leasing 
program.
    And to Mr. Cassidy's point, I think it is really well made, 
we had numerous people we had to deal with through the leasing 
process. I think this could be simplified. I think the person 
we were dealing with most was Sandy Cool. She is retired now. 
She was director of concessions, so not necessarily up to date 
on leasing.
    The other problem we had in our financing situation was 
nobody could give us a value to the lease. Well, a lease 
actually does have value and a real estate specialist would 
understand, promote that, or a real estate appraiser. We pay a 
very limited rent in return for our return on investment of our 
initial money we put in the bathhouse, so there are things 
there that really are not being, I don't think, championed to 
people. And I think, to your point, somebody along the lines 
that has more day-to-day knowledge of real estate could make a 
huge difference.
    And the other thing that would be nice to see is some kind 
of single source to deal with in terms of trying to go through 
the leasing process. As Pat has experienced in his lease terms, 
you think you are done and then somebody from some other 
department sends an e-mail saying what about this, and then you 
think you have to start over. So, I think some simplification 
that would allow a one-stop shopping kind of thing would be 
really helpful.
    Now, going back to the whole maintenance idea, I do see 
that as a total win-win. In my written testimony, I have kind 
of outlined the amount of investment we made, the amount of 
maintenance we have done, the amount that we keep in a 
maintenance reserve fund. One other thing I could suggest is 
that that maintenance reserve fund be capped at a certain 
point, because as it is, it is 2 percent of our gross progress, 
and that is pretty substantial. We tried to negotiate with that 
when we were negotiating our lease, but that didn't go 
anywhere. And I think Pat tried to do the same thing with the 
same result.
    Anyway, I do see, as Pat said, the program being just a 
win-win for everyone. We see the fact that we have to do 
maintenance as prescribed by the National Park Service as 
something that comes with the territory of being a steward of a 
national historic landmark building, and I think we all take 
that seriously, and I think the city of Hot Springs does too. 
The fact that we do have to maintain our buildings regularly is 
great. I mean, this is our best foot forward to the world.
    Quapaw Baths gets people from all over the world, not just 
the United States, and people always comment on how beautiful 
Hot Springs National Park is. So, it is a wonderful thing.
    I would also like to say, under the overall program, it is 
really a jobs creation program too, and I don't know that that 
gets stressed enough. Quapaw currently has 46 team members. We 
have a payroll in excess of $1.4 million annually. We are 
generating a lot of good things there with people now having 
jobs, people paying taxes, people investing all sorts of things 
that benefit our entire community. I understand that the lease 
program may not be right for areas, as you mentioned, that are 
rural. But in any kind of a semi-urban environment, it just 
makes so much sense to get the participation of the city and 
the parks working together. That public-private partnership is 
a great thing and I think it works really well here.
    In closing, I would just say thank you again. We think the 
program is working well, and hope to see it being used more 
often around the country.
&lt;/option&gt;
