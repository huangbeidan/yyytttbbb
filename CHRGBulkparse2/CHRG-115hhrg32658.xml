Administration for purposes of today's Committee meeting. A 
quorum is present, so we may proceed. The meeting record will 
remain open for 5 legislative days, so that Members may submit 
any materials they wish to be included therein.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker=""&gt;There are two items on the docket today: H.R. 5305, the 
Federal Depository Library Program Modernization Act of 2018; 
and H.R. 4631, the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports 
Act. H.R. 5305, the Federal Depository Library Program 
Modernization Act of 2018, reflects the Committee's work over 
the last year, which included holding five hearings and three 
bipartisan stakeholder meetings. In examining potential reforms 
to the Federal Depository Library Program, the Committee found 
the free flow of government information is fundamental to a 
democratic society, and members of the public have a right of 
access to government information. The Federal Depository 
Library Program, or FDLP as it is commonly known, is an 
essential service by which members of the public can access 
government information. These libraries partner with the 
Government Publishing Office, and offices of the Federal 
Government to ensure that members of the public, throughout the 
United States, have effective, no-fee access to government 
information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker=""&gt;Most government information currently produces an 
electronic format. As a result, 97 percent of new information 
available through FDLP is in that electronic format. The 
government has a responsibility to disseminate and provide 
permanent public access to information to ensure that members 
of the public are fully aware of the activities of their 
government, to spur innovation and research, and to promote 
good government. And the sole focus of the Superintendent of 
Documents should be on implementing programs to ensure no-fee 
access to government information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker=""&gt;To that end, H.R. 5305 makes the following changes to the 
FDLP; it recognizes existence of a national collection of 
information dissemination products; it updates the types of 
depository libraries across the country that may participate in 
FDLP; it eliminates the problems with fugitive documents in the 
government; it allows the FDLP to accept work completed by the 
library community; it provides for greater transparency in the 
FDLP itself; and it removes the sales program from the purview 
of the superintendent of documents to allow the superintendent 
to focus on no-fee access to government information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker=""&gt;The bill is supported by the major library associations, 
including the American Library Association, the American 
Association of Law Libraries, the Association of Research 
Libraries, and the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker=""&gt;The second bill on the docket is H.R. 4631, the Access to 
Congressionally Mandated Reports Act. H.R. 4631 was introduced 
by our colleague, Representative Quigley from Illinois. In 
short, H.R. 4631 also amends Title 44 by requiring the 
Government Publishing Office, or GPO, to, among other things, 
establish and maintain a publicly available website containing 
copies of all congressionally mandated reports. The bill also 
directs the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance 
to Federal agencies to assist them in submitting the reports to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker=""&gt;The bill was marked up and reported out of the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform earlier this year. Forty-five 
organizations support this bipartisan legislation. I am pleased 
the Committee on House Administration is acting on this good 
government bill as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker=""&gt;    I will now like to recognize my colleague and the 
Committee's Ranking Member, Mr. Brady, for purposes of an 
opening statement, if he wishes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Brady&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this
business meeting this morning. I support both proposals before 
us and the bipartisan work they represent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;H.R. 5305 is good for the Government Publishing Office, it 
is good for the taxpayers, and most important to me, it is good 
for Philadelphia. I was very pleased to receive a letter from 
Temple University supporting this legislation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;Federal Depository Library Program plays an important role 
in our democratic process and helps the American public stay 
informed and hold its government accountable. I know Committee 
staff on both sides of the aisle worked hard on this, and I 
would like to thank Khalil Abboud from my staff and Bob Tapella 
on the majority staff for all the efforts that went into this 
legislation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;H.R. 4631 is a positive step towards increasing 
transparency in how the Federal Government operates. While 
congressional committees emphasize oversight on the executive 
branch, ultimately, we all answer to the American people, and 
they have a right to know how their tax dollars are being 
spent, what is working, and what are areas that need 
improvement. These reports provide a unique insight into these 
questions though they are not always easy to find.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;This legislation will create a one-stop shop for 
congressional mandated reports, and I am proud to support it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you, Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr"&gt;Brady.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr"&gt;I would ask if any other Member of the Committee wishes to 
be recognized for purposes of providing an opening statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr"&gt;    Seeing none, I now call up and--oh, I am sorry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lofgren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;I just want to be very brief. You know, the
House Administration Committee is a work-a-day Committee and 
doesn't always get the attention for, you know, a variety of 
reasons. But this is really significant, and I want to give 
credit to both you and Mr. Brady and all the other Committee 
members. Because in a democratic society, knowledge is power. 
And so what we are doing today is to give additional access to 
knowledge to the American public to enhance their authority. 
And I just think it is important to view this and the 
subsequent bill in that light. And I just wanted to note that 
and how significant this really is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;    And I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you, Ms&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ms"&gt;Lofgren, for your support and
your comments as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ms"&gt;Any other Members?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ms"&gt;I now call up and lay before the Committee, H.R. 5305, the 
FDLP Modernization Act of 2018. Without objection, the bill is 
considered read. And the amendment in the nature of a 
substitute provided to each of you will serve as the base text 
and is considered open for amendment at any point.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
