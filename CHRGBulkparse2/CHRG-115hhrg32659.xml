    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker=""&gt;    The Chairman. I call to order the Committee on House &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker=""&gt;Staff Present: Sean Moran, Staff Director; Kim Betz, Deputy

Administration for purposes of today's Committee meeting. A 
quorum is present, so we may proceed. The meeting record will 
remain open for 5 legislative days, so that Members may submit 
any materials they wish to be included therein.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker=""&gt;There are several items on the docket today. First on the 
agenda are two Committee resolutions amending the Committee's 
and Members' Congressional Handbooks, respectively. Committee 
Resolution 115-10 updates the advertisement regulations found 
in the Members' Congressional Handbook, and Resolution 115-11 
updates the advertisement regulations found in the Committee's 
Congressional Handbook. To place an advertisement with official 
resources, Representatives of the House are required to follow 
the regulations found in the Members' Congressional Handbook 
and submit the advertisement to the Franking Commission for an 
advisory opinion. Committee Resolution 115-10 updates the 
regulation to add additional categories for which Members may 
advertise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker=""&gt;This update will offer additional flexibility to Members 
when communicating with their constituents while ensuring that 
the Franking Commission has clear direction on which 
advertisements are permissible. Committee Resolution 115-11 
simply updates the Committee's Congressional Handbook to codify 
the current practice of allowing committee offices to advertise 
for followers on social media, using their subcommittee titles 
in addition to the full committee name.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker=""&gt;Next on the agenda is Committee Resolution 115-12. This 
past February, the House passed H. Res. 724, which, among other 
things, required each House office to establish a universal 
antiharassment and antidiscrimination policy. H. Res. 724 also 
charged this Committee with establishing the regulations to 
assist House offices in developing their respective policies. 
Committee Resolution 115-12 sets out these regulations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker=""&gt;These regulations should not be construed to limit a House 
office if it would like to add to the policy. The regulations 
contained in Committee Resolution 115-12 will be the minimum 
requirements for an office's policy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker=""&gt;The last item on the agenda is a package of Committee 
Resolutions that will strengthen the regulations associated 
with individuals known as shared employees who are employed by 
three or more offices. I would like to thank the Vice Chairman, 
Mr. Davis, for his work on this issue through the task force, 
as well as the Ranking Member, who provided insight. I 
appreciate your good work, the products of which we are marking 
up today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker=""&gt;Committee Resolutions 115-13 through 115-18 set forth 
policies the Committee has identified as essential to 
mitigating the risk posed by shared administrative employees 
and directing the House chief administrative officer, the House 
Sergeant at Arms, and the Clerk of the House to report back to 
the Committee within 30 days on the plans to implement these 
policies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker=""&gt;In addition, Committee Resolution 115-17 reiterates the 
responsibilities of a shared IT or finance employee as well as 
sets forth the new regulations and requirements of undergoing a 
background check and adhering to best practices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker=""&gt;    I would now like to recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. 
Brady, for the purpose of providing an opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Brady&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Brady&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I support all the resolutions on our agenda 
this afternoon. I appreciate the work of Representative Davis 
in always thinking of ways we can better communicate with our 
constituents. And those two resolutions are good steps in 
giving our colleagues more tools to do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;We continue our work improving the congressional workplace 
with our resolutions on the antiharassment and 
antidiscrimination policies. Once again, Jackie Speier and 
Bradley Byrne have been helping in making sure that we get this 
right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;With the training schedule we start next week, the timing 
is now for offices to start developing their own policies, and 
this regulation will give them a roadmap to just to do that. I 
would also like to mention that the Senate needs to act on our 
bill. We had a unanimous vote out of the House. The delay in 
the Senate is unacceptable, and they are further embarrassing 
themselves, which is pretty hard to do. They need to pass our 
bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;I will be submitting a longer statement for the record on 
the shared employees reforms we are considering. I support 
them, but I hope they are just a start.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;There are five different resolutions dealing with this 
issue, and I understand we are considering them altogether, 
which we should. But I want to make the point that there are so 
many resolutions, because everyone plays a part in making 
management--in managing this risk to the House.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;I look forward to seeing what the CAO and the other offices 
report back to us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. The gentleman yields back&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;I would ask if any other Member of the Committee wishes to 
be recognized for the purpose of providing an opening 
statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the Vice President of the--
Vice Chairman, excuse me, new promotion for you, the Vice 
Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Davis.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    The Vice President was cornered leaving the President of 
France's speech by Virginia Foxx, so I think he is probably 
still on the House floor.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. It is a matter of education&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="The Chairman. It is a matter of education"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;I would like to associate myself with the comments from 
Ranking Member Brady in regards to our colleagues over in the 
Senate too. But I really want to thank Chairman Harper and 
Ranking Member Brady for their help in helping us craft the 
policies that we are addressing in today's markup.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Over the past year, the Franking Commission has been 
working in a bipartisan manner to make improvements in the 
Franking regulations. I want to thank the Ranking Member, Susan 
Davis, and our fellow colleagues. And most importantly, I want 
to thank of the Franking Commission staff for their hard work 
throughout this process. They held listening sessions and 
following feedback with Member office--from Member offices. The 
Franking Commission decided to update several areas in the 
Franking regs to increase efficiency, flexibility, and 
transparency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Last fall, we passed a Committee Resolution that now allows 
Members to link directly to government websites, making it 
easier for them to connect their constituents with important 
information. And today, we are making it easier for Members to 
share their legislative priorities with their constituents 
also.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;For the shared employee Resolution, thank you, Chairman 
Harper, for the opportunity to work with my colleagues on this 
very important issue. Following a series of breaches to the 
House system, the Chairman hosted several meetings where we 
discussed shared employees. He then asked me to lead the task 
force to reform the shared employee program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    The task force held numerous meetings and bipartisan Member 
listening sessions that were attended by both the Chairman and 
the Ranking Member. I do want to thank the Members who were not 
on this Committee who attended the listening sessions. Their 
input directly impacted the policies in the Resolution before 
us today. This carefully crafted Resolution balances the 
autonomy of Member offices while working to ensure the security 
of the House network. It is important and imperative--it is 
important and imperative that Jamie Raskin come back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. The Vice Chairman is recognized&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="The Chairman. The Vice Chairman is recognized"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Thank you to my colleague, Ms. Comstock, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;It is important that we actually get this right when it 
comes to shared employees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;This Resolution instructs the CAO and the Sergeant at Arms 
to report back to this Committee on how they will implement 
various new policies, such as establishing technical and 
financial standards for shared employees, terminating network 
access for shared employees who violate House policies, 
developing new badges for shared employees, and implementing a 
much-needed background check system.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;During my tenure on House Administration, I have worked 
towards the goal of professionalizing the House's operations 
and offices under the guidance of Chairman Harper and Former 
Chairlady Miller. I am disappointed in the events that led to 
this markup today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;Throughout this process, we were able to work with Members 
on both sides of the aisle to develop these policies that will 
better protect the House network from bad actors in the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;    And I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. The Vice Chairman yields back&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="The Chairman. The Vice Chairman yields back"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="The Chairman. The Vice Chairman yields back"&gt;I now call up and lay before the Committee, Committee 
Resolution 151-10 to approve the updates to the Members'
