    Mr. Westerman. The Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations will come to order. The Subcommittee is meeting

Natural Resources Laws Gone Astray, Part II.''
    Under Committee Rule 4(f), oral opening statements at

Member, the Vice Chair, and the Vice Ranking Member. Therefore, 
I ask unanimous consent that all other Members' opening 
statements be made part of the hearing record if they are 
submitted to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5:00 p.m.
    Hearing no objection, so ordered.
    I also ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from 
Louisiana, Mr. Graves, be allowed to sit with the Subcommittee 
and participate in the hearing.
    Hearing no objection, so ordered.
    I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Today, we will examine the implementation of
two significant laws: the Marine Mammal Protection Act, or the 
MMPA; and the National Historic Preservation Act, also referred 
to as NHPA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;It is good to be back with the O&amp;amp;I Subcommittee. I served 
on this Committee last Congress. While this is my first hearing 
as the Chairman of the Subcommittee, this is the second hearing 
in a series that the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee 
is holding to examine the impacts of Federal natural resources 
laws that have stretched beyond Congress' original intent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;As a professional engineer and forester by trade, many of 
these issues hit close to home for me, and I am committed to 
pursuing thoughtful oversight with a scientific approach using 
my professional expertise. I look forward to working with 
Ranking Member McEachin and the other members of this 
Subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;As this Committee has previously explored, numerous Federal 
laws allow the executive branch to enjoy far more power and 
exercise more discretion in implementing these laws than 
Congress ever intended.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Last May, the Subcommittee held a hearing to discuss with 
those impacted how agencies were improperly implementing the 
Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the Indian 
Reorganization Act, and the Wilderness Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;As we continue our review, we have found other instances of 
Federal agencies expanding their roles through unclear and 
over-reaching regulations. In many of these cases, the expanded 
implementation of these laws has led to inefficient and 
burdensome regulatory processes, excessive amounts of 
litigation, and overall adverse effects for the American 
taxpayer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The MMPA was enacted to minimize harm to marine mammals due 
to human behavior. Regulations to protect marine mammals, 
however, have become extremely restrictive and oppressive 
without yielding significantly greater protections for these 
species.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;For example, it is evident that the inefficient manner in 
which regulations are implemented under the MMPA has led to 
severe delays in permit issuances for entities wishing to carry 
out their operations, while sincerely ensuring the safety of 
marine mammals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;One of our four witnesses today will describe how this 
lengthy and complicated process affects seismic surveyors' 
efforts to explore our country's critical offshore oil and gas 
resources. Seismic surveyors have a history of safely operating 
in our Nation's oceans, while providing necessary information 
to initiate offshore energy production. We depend on such 
energy production for our country's energy independence. 
Seismic surveyors, however, have faced a long, uphill battle in 
obtaining the necessary permits, with some companies still 
waiting to receive authorizations today, after beginning the 
process over 6 years ago.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;This morning, we will also hear testimony related to the 
NHPA. Congress passed this Act with the intention of protecting 
America's most treasured historic sites from destruction or 
substantial alteration. In past years, the Act has provided 
success in preserving some of our most cherished historic 
sites.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Unfortunately, today, the implementation of this Act has 
expanded beyond its original mission of protecting cherished 
historic sites, and has created an enormous burden for many 
Federal agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Under Section 106 of the law, Federal agencies are required 
to consider any possible impacts to historic sites when issuing 
permits and approving projects. Traditionally, the law is 
intended to allow agencies to consult the National Register of 
Historic Places for any impacts of their actions. However, 
today, this has evolved into a process that is extremely time-
consuming and burdensome, causing major delays for the approval 
of projects and permits, even if there is little expected 
impact to historic sites.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The experience of one of our witnesses here with us today, 
Ms. Patricia Brandt, also exemplifies how this law is 
misapplied and vulnerable to abuse. Her neighborhood of 
Eastmoreland, in Portland, Oregon, is currently under 
consideration for designation as a historic district on the 
National Register. Her experience highlights the difficult and 
confusing processes required for opposing listings under 
National Park Service rules, and exposes how this Federal 
process is often used to bypass local decision making on such 
matters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;As we examine issues that have arisen from the improper 
implementation of these laws, I hope our discussion today will 
bring us closer to potential solutions that bring the 
application of these laws back to Congress' original intent. I 
look forward to hearing from our witnesses and members, and 
look for ways how we can accomplish this for both the MMPA and 
the NHPA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Westerman "&gt;I would now like to thank our witnesses for being here 
today, and I look forward to hearing your testimony.
Prepared Statement of the Hon. Bruce Westerman, Chairman, Subcommittee&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Westerman "&gt;on Oversight and Investigations&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Westerman "&gt;Today, we will examine the implementation of two significant laws--
The Marine Mammal Protection Act, or the MMPA, and the National 
Historic Preservation Act, also referred to as NHPA. While this is my 
first hearing as the Chairman of the Subcommittee, this is the second 
hearing in a series the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee is 
holding to examine the impacts of Federal natural resources laws that 
have stretched beyond Congress' original intent. As a professional 
engineer and forester by trade, many of these issues hit close to home 
for me, and I am committed to pursuing thoughtful oversight with a 
scientific approach using my professional expertise. I look forward to 
working with Ranking Member McEachin, and the other members of this 
Subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Westerman "&gt;As this Committee has previously explored, numerous Federal laws 
allow the executive branch to enjoy far more power and exercise more 
discretion in implementing these laws than Congress ever intended. Last 
May, the Subcommittee held a hearing to discuss with those impacted how 
agencies were Indian Reorganization Act, and the Wilderness Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Westerman "&gt;As we continue our review, we have found other instances of Federal 
agencies expanding their roles through unclear and over-reaching 
regulations. In many of these cases, the expanded implementation of 
these laws has led to inefficient and burdensome regulatory processes, 
excessive amounts of litigation, and overall adverse effects for the 
American taxpayer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Westerman "&gt;The MMPA was enacted to minimize harm to marine mammals due to 
human behavior. Regulations to protect marine mammals, however, have 
become extremely restrictive and oppressive without yielding

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF THE HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THE HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN"&gt; I would like to recognize the Ranking Member
of the Subcommittee, Mr. McEachin of Virginia, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McEachin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome back to
the Subcommittee. We look forward to working with you as we go 
forward. And thank you to each of our witnesses for making the 
time to be here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;I want to suggest that this hearing is not what it appears 
to be.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;A hearing to truly understand the question posed by the 
Majority would include not just the good people here today, but 
the Administration, as well. They would be able to fill in the 
details about the decisions behind each of these cases. We are 
going to have an incomplete picture today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;A hearing to truly understand the question posed by the 
Majority would also have to include one of the most recent and 
most egregious cases: this Administration's apparent steam-
rolling of the multiple-use mandate in the Federal Land 
Management Policy Act, or FLPMA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;Secretary Zinke and other Trump administration officials 
have repeatedly used the term ``energy dominance'' when 
advocating even more fossil fuel production on public lands. 
However, it is unclear how the Administration plans to balance 
its desire for energy dominance with its responsibility to 
protect public lands under FLPMA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;FLPMA requires BLM land use to be decided on the basis of 
multiple use and sustained yield. FLPMA does not give one type 
of land use priority over another, as this Administration is 
clearly trying to do by prioritizing coal, oil and gas 
extraction on public lands at the expense of other uses like 
fishing, camping, and hunting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;The courts have already ruled on this and have determined 
that multiple use does not mean that every piece of land must 
be available for every use, or that BLM should prioritize 
development on lands over other uses. The law does not 
prioritize economic return or mineral extraction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;Secretary Zinke's efforts to give away even more public 
land to the oil industry under the guise of energy dominance is 
eyebrow-raising when we stop to consider what they already 
have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;Oil and gas companies have access to 90 percent of BLM 
land. In fact, oil companies are not bothering to produce oil 
and gas on public lands they already have leased. Fifty-three 
percent of public land acreage that has been leased to oil and 
gas companies across the United States is not even in 
production as of Fiscal Year 2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;Nevertheless, we will not hear about this Administration's 
stretching of FLPMA, because this hearing is really just 
another thinly disguised attempt to undermine our bedrock 
environmental laws.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;While the Majority is doing that, they continue to 
completely ignore the single biggest issue in our jurisdiction: 
climate change.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;Climate change is not just coming, it is here. The breaking 
off of the Larsen C ice shelf last week is the latest of a long 
list of warnings that my colleagues are straining to ignore.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;This Subcommittee should be spending our time looking at 
how we can minimize the effects of climate change and how we 
can prepare for it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;We should also be looking at uncertain likelihood, 
extremely high-consequence events. Consider the potential 
release of just a fraction of the gigatons of carbon stored in 
the methane hydrates around the globe. If the atmosphere warms 
enough for that to happen, it would be irreversible, rapid, and 
catastrophic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;But to my colleagues, they want to have yet another hearing 
attacking our environmental protections and an administration 
that is already in the history books. The American people 
deserve better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    A hearing to truly understand the question posed by the Majority 
would include not just the good people here today, but the

    Mr. Westerman. I thank the Ranking Member for his remarks, 
and I will now introduce today's witnesses.
    Dr. Amos Loveday is a consultant and a former historic 
preservation officer for both the Federal Communications 
Commission and the state of Ohio. Welcome, Dr. Loveday.
    Ms. Patty Brandt is the managing member of Patricia Brandt 
Consulting, and a resident of the Eastmoreland neighborhood in 
Portland, Oregon. Thank you for joining us.
    Ms. Amanda Leiter is a Professor with Washington College of 
Law at American University. Thank you for being here, as well.
    And Ms. Nikki Martin is the President of the International 
Association of Geophysical Contractors. And thank you for your

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF AMOS J. LOVEDAY, PH.D., ATCHLEY HARDIN LANE, LLC,&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
  Prepared Statement of the Hon. A. Donald McEachin, Ranking Member,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;COLUMBUS, OHIO&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;Dr. Loveday. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the 
Committee. It is truly an honor to be invited to testify at 
this hearing on the National Historic Preservation Act. It was 
51 years ago today, almost exactly, that your predecessors at 
the National Parks and Recreation Subcommittee held hearings in 
this room, I believe, on Senate Bill 3035, which would become 
the National Historic Preservation Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;Your hearing memorandum described well the program that was 
enacted in this room on that day, and later in August, so I 
will not focus on that. Rather, I intend to focus my comments 
and also my written comments on the issue raised on page 7, 
determined eligible issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;Let me begin by observing that the National Historic 
Preservation Act, as it was passed, rested on two basic 
assumptions. First, there would be created a National Register 
of Historic Places, a well-researched, public listing of 
historic sites worthy of preservation. The National Park 
Service was to develop criteria and then, through partnerships 
with the states, conduct a nationwide survey to identify sites 
that would be eligible, and list those sites on the National 
Register.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;Second, once that register was completed, Federal agencies, 
in the course of carrying out their responsibilities, would 
consult the register and, where possible, avoid impact on any 
of the listed sites. I emphasize for purposes here, that the 
Federal agencies were not expected to extend provisions of the 
Act to a site until it was actually listed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;The approach was logical, reasonable, efficient, and 
broadly supported. The bill passed both Houses of this body in 
late September, and was signed into law by President Johnson on 
October 15, 1966. It was shortly after the bill was signed into 
law that the issue that you raised, the determined eligible 
issue, arose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;In an effort to find money to finance the war in Vietnam, 
the Johnson administration decided not to ask Congress for the 
appropriation to support the state survey. Hence, the National 
Register, the foundational part of the Act, was not funded for 
about 6 years. To compensate, the Park Service devised a 
temporary solution that would rely on agencies, rather than the 
states, to identify eligible sites and do that in the context 
of projects that the agencies were undertaking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;The Nixon administration ratified this approach with an 
Executive Order, and in 1976 it was written into the Act 
itself.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;While the eligible approach did not preclude actual 
listing, it rendered entry on the National Register to be 
unnecessary, since it extended most of the protections of the 
Act to sites that were determined eligible, but never listed. 
It was a temporary fix that had become permanent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;Let me discuss four problems that were associated with the 
Act, four problems that have fallen out of the determined 
eligible reinterpretation of the Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;First, it redefined the point at which protected benefits 
of the Act commenced. Under the Act itself, it was the actual 
listing on the Register that provided the protection; under the 
changes, it was the determined eligible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;Second, it collapsed the identification and evaluation of 
effects into a single process, and this has allowed a great 
deal of use of the Act for surrogate agendas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;Third, it is inefficient. Federal agency actions, at best, 
result in only about 1.5 percent nominations for the surveys 
they do. Nor do the Federal agencies' actions identify harm. 
The Congressional Research Service, in 2012, for example, 
reported that only about 2 percent of the Federal undertakings 
identified any harm from that undertaking at all.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;If the results are not great, or if the results or maybe 
the costs are great, however, one study done--and I would point 
out by pro-preservation groups--estimated that the 
investigations carried out to meet the legal obligations of the 
Act cost about $1 billion a year. For your comparison, that is 
the combined budgets of the National Archives, the National 
Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the 
Arts, and the National Institute for Museum and Library 
Services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="AMOS J. LOVEDAY"&gt;Finally, I would suggest to you my experience is that the 
determined eligible approach does not produce very good 
research results. My written testimony goes into that in more 
detail.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Dr. Loveday follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;I conclude by simply observing that you are dealing with a 
temporary fix 50 years after it went into effect. It is 
probably time to take a look at it, understanding that there is 
already a lot of money sloshing around in the system. You may 
want to redirect to actually doing the surveys that needed to 
be done to make this Act work. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, it is an honor to be 
invited to testify at this hearing on the National Historic 
Preservation Act. It was 51 years ago almost to the day (July 15, 1966) 
that your predecessors on the National Parks and Recreation 
Subcommittee of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs held 
hearings on S. Bill 3035 very near where we are today (Rm. 1328). That 
bill would become the National Historic Preservation Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Your ``Hearing Memorandum'' described well the program that NHPA 
created so I will focus on the ``determined eligible'' issue 
highlighted on page 7.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Let me begin by observing the National Historic Preservation Act as 
passed rested on two assumptions:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; First, there would be created a National Register of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Historic Places, a well-researched, public listing of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;historic sites worthy of preservation. The National Park&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Service was to develop criteria and then through&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;partnerships with states conduct a nationwide survey to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;identify sites that were eligible.\1\ Those sites after&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;careful review and documentation were to be listed in the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Register.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;\1\ The Administration representative, George Hartzog, NPS 
Director, advised the Committee on July 15 that the survey would cost 
$40,000,000 and require 4 years to complete. The same figures and 
schedule were repeated at August hearings and as late as mid-September 
the Administration indicated a request for about $10,000,000 would be 
in its next budget submission.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Second, Federal agencies in the course of carrying out&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;their responsibilities would consult that Register and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;where possible avoid listed sites. When listed sites could&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;not be avoided the agency was to consult with a body called&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to devise a 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;strategy to minimize harm.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; I emphasize for purposes here that Federal agencies were&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;not expected to extend the provisions of the Act to a site&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;until it was listed in the National Register and that&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;listing had been published.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The approach was logical, reasonable, efficient, and broadly 
supported.\2\ The bill passed both Houses in late September and the 
President signed it on October 15, 1966.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;\2\ No one testified against the bill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Problems appeared immediately that led to the ``determined 
eligible'' issues you alluded to in your memorandum!&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;To find money to finance the War in Vietnam and Great Society 
Programs the Johnson administration decided not to ask Congress to 
appropriate the money to support the states' survey.&amp;lt;SUP&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/SUP&amp;gt; Hence 
the National Register, the foundation part of the program, was 
unfunded.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;To compensate the Park Service devised what was promoted as a 
temporary solution. It would rely on agencies rather than the states to 
identify and nominate sites. In summary, each agency was to do the 
research to determine if eligible historic sites were present in its 
holding or project areas before it took actions that my cause an 
adverse effect.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;In theory, the agency was to go through the National Register 
nomination and review process for any eligible sites it discovered. 
However, when the nomination and review process proved to be time 
consuming the Advisory Council devised an approach that allowed 
agencies to skip the actual nomination if they agreed to treated 
eligible sites as if they were actually listed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;In a series of guidance documents that culminated in 36 CFR 800 
ACHP laid down rules to guide agencies--rules that gave preservation 
considerable leverage when using the ``determined eligible'' approach. 
As Robert Garvey, the first Director of the Advisory Council put it the 
agencies ``. . . didn't know what that meant [to consult with ACHP] nor 
how to go about it, so we started giving them guidelines that ended up 
in sort of 40 pages of regulations that leaves no stone unturned--tell 
you exactly what to do every step of the way.\4\

on or about August 4, 1981 (College Park, MD: University of Maryland, 
1991), 51-52.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;This approach was ratified by the Nixon administration in Executive 
Order 11593 and the phrase ``or eligible for inclusion in the National 
Register'' added to Section 106 of the Act in 1976.\5\ The temporary 
fix had become permanent.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;\5\ Executive Order 11593 (May 6, 1971) Sec. 2(b).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;While the eligible approach did not preclude actual listing it 
rendered listing on the Register unnecessary for Section 106 
protection. In doing so it had several pernicious consequences. Let me 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
discuss four.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; It redefined the point at which the protective benefits of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;the Act commenced. Under the 1966 Act as passed a discrete&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;act of government--The Keeper of the Register adding the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;site to the National Register--granted historic status and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;the privileges that carried. Under the Eligibility approach&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;a site acquired historic status when it met the criteria&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;for consideration. A significant consequence of this change&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;was the triggering of the Act's provisions without the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;owner or anyone else knowing it had occurred.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;\6\ For example, the owner of a property might be prepared to lease 
space to a cell tower builder only to be told by the builder that 
because the property was discovered to eligible for listing the company 
was choosing another site. More disturbing the owner of a property that 
was not eligible in its own right might find that a neighboring 
property was eligible and to avoid mitigation cost the tower builder is 
abandoning the site.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; It collapses the identification of sites and the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;evaluation of effects into the same process. This&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;encouraged activists to use historic sites as surrogates&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;for other agendas. Essentially, those opposed to change&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;look for eligible sites and use their presence to delay or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;prevent projects they oppose.\7\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;By the beginning of the 21st century preservation standards had&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;become so lax and the historic sites value as a surrogate&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;so well known that activists routinely advised taking&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;advantage of Section 106 and local versions. For example,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;one activist advised his readers that historic districts&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;``are designated for any number of economic and social&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;for a failed appropriation, appears to have become 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;inefficient and costly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Surveys done to satisfy the ACHP rules appear to identify very&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;few sites. During the past decade agencies have averaged&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;over 100,000 106 undertakings annually. Since National&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Register listings during that have averaged about 1,350&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;sites per year, most of which come from Tax credit projects&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;not Section 106 generated research, the surveys are not&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;contributing much to the actual National Register program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;At best agency efforts result in new register listings less&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;than 1.4 percent of the time.\9\

to NPS to fulfill the reporting requirements of their Historic

    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Nor do the surveys seem to identify harms to sites. For example,&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;about 2 percent of the Federal undertakings had an adverse&lt;/paragraph&gt;

reviewed non-academic research in 1993 and dismissed most Section 106 
reports as ``brief,'' ``inconclusive.'' See Bastian and Bergstrom,

    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;I conclude with the observation that the ``determined eligible 
approach,'' a temporary measure created to compensate for Vietnam War 
time austerity, should be revisited and maybe even retired. We should 
return to the intent of the Act--the identification of sites worthy of 
preservation for their historic value, a robust National Register 
Program grounded in excellent research that is fully visible to all 
citizens, and an administration of preservation rules firmly committed 
to resisting their use as tool for other agendas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;That is not what we have at present. Indeed, we have a complex and 
often opaque process. One, to use William Murtagh the first Keeper of 
the National Register words, in which ``process and methodology have 
replaced subject in many instances.'' \16\ A process that Robert Stipe, 
an attorney and leading preservationist during the closing years of the 
20th century described as ``highly technical, sometimes almost to the 
point of unintelligible . . .'' \17\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The National Trust's 2010 analysis of the National Historic 
Preservation Act's Section 106 observed that some preservationists 
expected it and ACHP to be ``a thumb on the preservation side of the 
scales.'' Casting preservation as a practice that merchants at one time 
used to cheat customers explains the anger that often swirls around 
preservation controversies. As with the shopper of old who expected the 
butcher's scales to provide an honest balance, many approach the 
preservation process expecting fairness but come away feeling 
cheated.\18\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;As the Committee revisits the ``determined eligible'' matter it 
would be well to keep in mind that it arose out of austerity. Put 
candidly Congress passed a law, then failed to fund its implementation 
and staff devised a work around. If Congress expects to fix the 
problems that have arisen it must either increase funding so the 
Preservation Act can function as drafters intended or reduce the legal 
mandate to fit the resources. Whatever steps this Committee takes I 
would hope that a review of funding levels for the program gets as much 
attention as other problems.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Question 1. You note in your testimony that activists use the 
identification of historic sites during the Section 106 process to 
further their own purposes and delay or block projects they oppose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;1a. Can you elaborate on how this tactic works?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. An organization or person who has little or no interest in 
a historic building/site but who may wish to prevent a project for 
other reasons can use actual or eligible National Register listings in 
the project's Area of Potential Effect to invoke procedural steps (i.e. 
the need for studies, public input, etc.) that delay undertaking 
approval. The most common techniques are:&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;most common tactic activists use is delaying their response&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Funding: A word about fees may be in order. As noted the State 
Historic Preservation Offices and Tribal Preservation Offices are 
funded by an NPS administered grant drawn from the Historic 
Preservation Fund. One of the complaints preservationist have is that 
Congress' refusal to increase the size of the HPF authorizations has 
resulted in the grants being stagnant. ACHP, supported by the National 
Trust and others in the Preservation community, has embarked on a 
campaign to ``end run'' the appropriation process by forcing agencies 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
to pay fees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Congress should confront the issue by either endorsing the ACHP 
approach, increasing HPF appropriations, or reconfiguring the Federal 
preservation program so it can live with in the resources available.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The funding situation that presently exists serves no one well and 
further distorts an already misshapen program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;1b. Does this comply with the intent of the National Historic 
Preservation Act of 1966?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. In my opinion, it does not comply with the intent of the 
Act. The National Historic Preservation Act assumed that NPS, working 
with the states would prepare a list of historic sites (the National 
Register) that would guide agency planning and in most cases, allow 
avoidance of historic sites. Fifty years later that list has not been 
completed. As a result, each Federal project is required to identify 
sites at or near the time the work is to occur. This reduces the 
identification of historic sites and the determination of an 
undertaking's effect to a single procedure and tends to encourage 
misuse of Section 106. Moreover, as will be discussed more fully in the 
response to other questions neither the ACHP nor agencies 
systematically check for abuses such as those cited above. (The Crow 
abuses were discovered by the tribe itself).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Question 2. Mr. Loveday, according to the NHPA, a Federal agency 
must take into account the effect of every ``Federal undertaking'' on 
historic properties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;2a. What role does each permitting agency play in deciding what 
falls under this definition?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. The ACHP definition of undertaking reads: ``Undertaking 
means a project, activity, or program funded in whole or in part under 
the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including 
those carried out by or on behalf of a Federal agency; those carried 
out with Federal financial assistance; and those requiring a Federal 
permit, license or approval'' and which have the potential to affect a 
historic site if one is present.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;An agency can determine, subject to ACHP challenge, which of its 
actions are undertakings for purposes of section 106. For example, the 
FCC attached a list of Activities it considers undertakings to a 2004 
agreement with ACHP noting that ``The Federal Communications Commission 
may determine in the future that additional communications facilities/
activities are undertakings for purposes of Section 106 or that certain 
covered facilities on this list no longer constitute undertakings for 
purposes of Section 106.'' \14\

Programmatic Agreement. Attachment 2'' https://apps.fcc.gov/
edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-04-222A5.pdf.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;ACHP also has procedures spelled out in 36 CFR 800.14 that allows 
agencies to customize ACHP rules to their needs. ACHP has in fact 
entered into agreements with several agencies to streamline its rules. 
The list of agreements maybe accessed at ``ACHP Agreement Documents,''

    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;For a good, but dated, overview of the ACHP's interpretation of the 
meaning and scope of ``undertaking'' and the ACHP's interpretation of 
court rulings on the subject see Federal Historic Preservation Case Law 
1966-1996 and Federal Historic Preservation Case Law Update 1996-2000

Councils Regulations and the ``Archive of ACHP Case Digests--Protecting 
Historic Properties: Section 106 in Action 1986-2005.'' \15\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;While provisions for ``tailoring'' of undertakings are available to 
agencies. taking advantage of them is often arduous and time consuming. 
For example, it required almost 5 years to craft the Nationwide 
Programmatic Agreements the FCC uses for towers. Moreover, the 
processes spelled out in 36 CFR 800.14 are too cumbersome to be useful 
for undertakings that involve emerging technology, or industries 
subject to rapid change. They take too long. For Example, the FCC 
agreements and the accompanying procedures for dealing with tribal 
consultation, designed to deal with tall towers, the standard at the 
time discussion on the alternative procedures began, were ill equipped 
to accommodate the needs of small cells and distributed antenna 
systems, the emerging technology by the time the agreements went into

effect.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;2b. Your testimony mentioned that Federal agencies have averaged a 
large number of undertakings annually. Are you aware of any controversy 
regarding the definition of an ``undertaking''?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. Let me divide this question into two parts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The following graph shows the number of Federal undertakings 
reviewed by the State and Tribal Preservation Officers. The SHPO 
numbers correlate generally with the economic cycle and the level of 
Federal activity. THPO activity is showing growth because of an 
increasing number of THPOs (58 in 2006 vs 151 in 2014) and tribes 
expanding their geographic areas of interest.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;.epsAre there issues over definitions? Yes--let me briefly discuss 
three, but prefaced with some background. When Congress passed the 
National Historic Preservation Act an ``undertaking'' (the term 
``undertaking'' was selected to replace ``project'' during the 1966 
hearings) was considered either a direct agency act or responsibility 
that followed Federal money for such things as highway construction or 
urban renewal. As Federal environmental programs came into existence 
undertaking increasingly came to apply to licenses or permits. Today 
most Section 106 undertakings probably fall into that licenses/permits 
category.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Small Handles: The first disagreement has to do with the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;level of Federal involvement necessary for an agency action&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;to be considered an undertaking. Sometimes referred to as&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;the ``Small Federal Handles'' issue it has plagued section&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;106 for years. In July 2016 ACHP Chairman Donaldson for&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;example noted that ``a long-standing issue in the Section&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;106 process has been the extent of Federal agency&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;responsibilities when there is only limited Federal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;involvement in a project, such as a Corps of Engineers'&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;permit.'' The issue lies at the heart of specific&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;controversies but more significantly ``Small Handles''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;burdens the Section 106 review process and agencies with&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;thousands of cases that have little or no consequence for&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;historic sites.\16\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Indirect Federal involvement: Over the years there have&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;been several challenges to the broad definition of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;undertaking. Typically, licensees object to the broad&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;definition. For example, CTIA challenged the FCC/ACHP&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;interpretation that treated the construction of towers&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;(which do not require Federal approval or involve Federal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;funding) as an undertaking. In general, the Courts have&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;upheld ACHP's broad definition of undertaking. In only a&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;few instances such as The National Mining Association v.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Fowler have the courts limited ACHP's far reaching 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;interpretation of undertaking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Active infrastructure: A more abstract but broadly&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;consequential disagreement exists on the treatment of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;active infrastructure as eligible historic sites (e.g.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;active roads, railroads, damns, airports, etc.,). Congress&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;enacted the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;largely to protect traditional historic sites from damage&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;resulting from infrastructure expansion. In the intervening&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;50 years ACHP, through Section 106, has expanded its&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;understanding of eligible sites to include the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;infrastructure itself as a class of historic sites and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;hence the modernization of that infrastructure as an&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;undertaking. As a result, such activities as bridge&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;replacement, railroad abandonment, or airport upgrades can&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;be considered adverse effects.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;\17\ For example, see Advisory Council on Historic Preservation,

to the Interstate Highway System,'' Federal Register, Vol. 70, No. 46

    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Unless exempted the improvements, upgrades, and modernization&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;that infrastructure requires becomes subject to the&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;associated with Section 106. Active infrastructure in a&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;integrate with other systems. Since the fundamental premise&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;of preservation is that the significant old should be&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;protected the section 106 process tends to resist&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;modernization. At the very least it adds expense and in the&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;infrastructure. The Administration and Congress discovered&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;harmonize preservation rules adopted for tall tower&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;undertakings with evolving ``4g'' and ``5g'' wireless&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;technology needs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;\20\ Looking back over the 20th Century Richard Moe, President of 
the National Trust for Historic Preservation, would say in 1996 that 
Preservationists and Historians were ``siblings separated at birth, 
growing up to pursue different goals . . .'' Richard Moe, ``Historians 
and Preservationists' Partnership for the Centuries,'' abstract, Forum 
News 2, no. 6 (September/October 1996).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Given that the ``undertaking'' as a concept is broad and the 
tendency particularly at the Advisory Council, is to expand its 
boundaries, there will likely continue to be disagreements over its 
definition.\21\ That having been said, it would serve the country well 
for Congress to rethink just what government actions should be 
subordinated to preservation scrutiny. For example, is it acceptable 
for preservation rules to thwart a properly enacted economic recovery 
program or consistent with the Nation's history to allow remnants of 
the past to impede addressing present needs?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;\21\ ACHP and the State/Tribal Preservation Officers have a history 
of aggressively expanding the definition of undertaking. Examples 
include efforts (unsuccessful) to treat the termination of the U.S. 
Trust relationship with Micronesia as an undertaking; argue that the 
replacement of obsolete scientific equipment is subject to Section 106 
and claimed at one point FAA flight plans over historic sites were 
undertakings. (See Amendments to Proposed Council Comment Regarding 
Termination of the United States Trustee Ship of the Islands of 
Micronesia n.p.: Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, April 25, 
1981; Williams Luther, Williams, Luther Senior Science Advisor National 
Science Foundation Statement before the Advisory Council February 5, 
1990; and S.K. Stevens, Chairman ACHP, to Hon. John J. Crocker, Jr, 
Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, April 30, 1969).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The question has been asked in one form or another over the years. 
In fact, it was a recurring topic of conversation even in the early 
days of the republic. Significantly the founders advised caution 
against giving the past too much of a sway over the present. For 
example, Thomas Jefferson worried about the past's grip famously 
writing that the earth belongs to the present and theorizing that a 
revolution might be needed every generation to loosen its grasp.\22\ 
James Madison was more optimistic about the new Nation's ability to 
deal with its past observing in Federalist 14 that ``is it not the 
glory of the people of America, that, whilst they have paid a decent 
regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not 
suffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to 
over-rule the suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of 
their own situation, and the lessons of their own experience?'' \23\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Section 106, if not attended too, may prove that Madison's optimism 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
was unwarranted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Question 3. Mr. Loveday, you discuss how agencies must identify 
historic properties on the National Register or eligible for inclusion 
on the National Register during the Section 106 process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;3a. Can you provide us with more information on the definition of a 
``historic property'' and what types of properties this includes?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. For Purposes of Section 106 a historic property is defined 
as one that is listed on or eligible for listing on the National 
Register of Historic Places.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Congress directed the Department of the Interior/National Park 
Service in the 1966 National Historic Preservation Act to define what 
types of sites should be considered historic and hence qualify for 
National Register eligibility. NPS did so by establishing criteria to 
guide the search for and evaluation of potential sites. Those criteria 
are contained in 36 CFR 60.4 (``Criteria for evaluation'') with the 
prefatory observation that ``these criteria are worded in a manner to 
provide for a wide diversity of resources.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;36 CFR 60.4 establishes two requirements a site must meet. (The 
italics in this section is added for emphasis.)&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;First a site must be ``significant'' in American history, 
architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture . . .''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Second a site must ``possess integrity of location, design, 
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. . .''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The rules proceed to further define significant sites as those 
sites that:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;a.  Are associated with events that have made a significant&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;b.  that are associated with the lives of persons significant in&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;our past; or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;c.  that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;or method of construction, or that represent the work of a&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;master, or that possess high artistic values, or that&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;components may lack individual distinction; or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;d.  that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;important in prehistory or history.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Next the rules provide guidance on how to apply the criteria, 
specifically advising that certain classes of property that may 
otherwise qualify should not be considered eligible. It advises that 
ordinarily the following types of sites will not be considered 
eligible:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;properties owned by religious institutions or used for&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;religious purposes,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; structures that have been moved from their original&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;locations,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;commemorative in nature, and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; properties that have achieved significance within the past&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;50 years shall not be considered eligible for the National&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Register.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Finally, the concluding paragraphs of 36 CFR 60.4 provides guidance 
on how to exempt from exemptions. In other words, the circumstances 
under which one of the exempted types might qualify. (e.g. ``A 
religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or 
artistic distinction or historical importance.'')&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;When taken as a whole the NPS rules cast a broad net. The intent 
was to make historic designation common place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;3b. Has this definition or the National Park Service's 
interpretation of it changed over time, and are you aware of any 
concerns or controversy surrounding this definition?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. The National Park Service, the agency charged with historic 
preservation took the position, until the mid-1950s that Federal 
recognition as being historic should be reserved for sites that were 
clearly associated with events or people of national importance and 
which had high levels of physical integrity. It changed its position in 
1956/57 and the language cited above (i.e. significance, integrity and 
the ``a''-``d'' list) began to appear in NPS publications.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;\24\ ``The Registry of National Historic Landmarks,'' (United 
States Department of the Interior/National Park Service, Int. Duo. 60-
83005).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The National Historic Preservation Act provided for the creation of 
A National Register of Historic Places and as noted above delegated to 
the Department of the Interior the task of developing criteria for 
eligibility. A NPS staff committee meeting in 1966/1967 essentially 
imported the existing NPS definitions removing references to national 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
importance or national significance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;While the basic concept for the Register and the criteria for 
eligibility have remained largely unchanged over the life of the Act, 
significant modifications in background assumptions have occurred.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Process has been altered: First and most fundamental, the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;process by which a site was recognized as historic and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;gained protection through Section 106 has been greatly&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;altered. During the 1950s, early 1960s and first months&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;after passage of the NHPA criteria were considered a&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;screening tool that guided in the identification of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;potentially eligible sites. Actual designation as historic&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;came with government action taken after several levels of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;evaluation and scrutiny. No one assumed that all eligible&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;sites would be or should be placed on the Register. The&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;assumption was that screening would take place at both the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;state and Federal level and the Secretary of the Interior&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;would designate those that survived. Put differently,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;meeting the NPS criteria allowed a site to be considered&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;for, but did not guarantee, eligibility for Federal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;designation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;When budget cuts in the late 1960s postponed the surveys that&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;were to identify sites that met the NPS criteria and from&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;which the National Register nominations could be drawn,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Park Service and Advisory Council Staff devised a temporary&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;solution that considered for purposes of Section 106 sites&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;that merely met the criteria as eligible. This temporary&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;solution became fixed in law with the 1976 amendments to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;the Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The new approach, because it assumed National Register status to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;result from a site merely meeting the criteria rather than&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;a discrete government act of recognition altered Section&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;106 practice. Under the initial concept an agency knew&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;where historic sites were to be encountered and engaged&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Section 106 only when a designated site could not be&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;avoided. Under the revised approach the agency had no way&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;of knowing where historic sites were located and hence had&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;to engage Section 106 and the Advisory Council/SHPO/THPO&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;for most of its undertakings. This change more than any&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;other alteration increased the burden of compliance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Selection process degraded: Second the rigor of the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;selection process has been much degraded. As noted above&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;NPS advises in its current rules that they should be&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;interpreted to create a large number and range of sites.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;This stands in sharp contrast to its early instructions to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;``apply the criteria strictly . . ..'' This shift has&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;resulted in a much-debased process for determining&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;eligibility, particularly when the eligibility is&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;determined during the Section 106 process, of which more&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;will be said in the response to Question 4. Thomas King, a&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;they agree can just do it, and in most cases, it's better&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;all-around to make the assumption and get on with figuring&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="600" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. I am not aware of any organized movement to alter the 
current definition of historic site. However, there has been occasional 
suggestions over the years that the concept of a National Register be 
modified or abandoned. One discussion thread on the American Cultural 
Resources Association website some years ago for example concluded that 
it was an anachronism. More recently there have been some voices 
suggesting that history be dropped from preservation. For example, 
Donovan Rypkema, one of preservation's most vocal advocates. told the 
National Trust meeting in 2009 that ``The rest of the English-speaking 
world does not have historic preservation. They have building 
conservation, or more broadly and appropriately, heritage conservation

    &lt;paragraph paraId="602" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Critics seem to want to decouple Section 106's protections from 
National Register eligibility. Often congregated under the ``Place 
Matters'' banner, they prefer a Section 106 process triggered by the 
needs of the current setting and the loosely defined concept of 
heritage conservation rather than strong links to the past. History in 
their view is a lifestyle choice. As Paul Goldberger, an architecture 
critic, observed there is a notion that modern preservation, ``is not 
using the building to teach us certain lessons about the way life used 
to be, but turning the building into an instrument that helps us live 
life the way we want to now.'' \30\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="604" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;William Schmickle in his 2008 book The Politics of Historic 
Districts captured the attitude that lies behind the move to exorcize 
history from preservation. He advised his readers to accept the fact 
that historic districts that ``are designated for any number of 
economic and social advantages may in fact have little to do with 
genuine preservation.'' To underscore the point, he continued 
``sometimes it's just preservation as decoration. Other times it is not 
even that.'' \31\

Hamer wrote ``A phrase I have heard repeatedly when I explained to 
historians and preservationists the nature of the inquiry on which I

for essentially believe that it is no longer essential for old 
buildings to have links to historic events or teach lessons--they 
should be seen as devices that allowed for a particular lifestyle or

aesthetic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="607" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Question 4. In your testimony, you note each Federal agency's 
responsibility under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation 
Act to identify sites included on or eligible to be included on the 
National Register.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;4a. How do agencies proceed to identify all of these properties, 
and what kind of efforts does that entail?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. Agencies differ in the particulars of how they go about 
identifying historic sites. In general, they consult existing records 
(i.e. the published National Register, state and tribal databases, 
previous Section 106 research that has taken place in the area of the 
undertaking, and such published sources as may be appropriate); conduct 
field surveys (i.e. actually visit the area and in some instances, do 
``archeological tests''); and invite consulting party comment that 
often sheds light on the location of sites.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;It may be useful to break the remainder of the answer to this 
question into two sections--the approach, or way the agency organizes 
its efforts to identify sites the steps it takes once identification is 
made.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Organizing the effort: In general, there are two&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;approaches--one relies on agency staff to perform the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;actual research work, the other relies on contractors or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;licensees/permittees to do the actual research under the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;supervision of agency staff. No matter which approach is&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;used, the agency (not its licensees/permittees) is in the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;end responsible for compliance with Section 106.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Section 306109 of the National Historic Preservation Act&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;authorizes agencies to expend funds for ``preservation&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;activities'' and allows ``reasonable costs to be charged to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;licensees and permittees as a condition of issuance of the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;license or permit. Expenses usually include the cost of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;doing the research, preparing forms, managing consulting&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;party input, mitigation, and increasingly the fees tribes&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;charge for commenting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;While some land managing agencies have preservation staffs to do&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;much of the research Section 106 requires, most agencies&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;contract for or require entities seeking licenses or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;permits to undertake the research to identify sites and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="630" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;engage consulting parties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="631" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Agencies usually do not publish their compliance costs (or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;timelines), however by marrying two sets of public data it&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;is possible to estimate cost and effort with some degree of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;accuracy. The American Cultural Resources Association, the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;association that represents the contractors, estimated in&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;2012 that its income from work required by the National&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Historic Preservation Act was over a billion dollars.\32\&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Since SHPOs reported to NPS that they issued 120,109&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;findings that year it appears that contract cost alone&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;averaged about $8,300 per undertaking.\33\ Add to that&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;mitigation costs, tribal consulting fees, and internal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;agency costs and it seems likely that on the average&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Section 106 costs for agencies or their licensees/&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;permittees is between $15,000 and $20,000 per Section 106&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;concur and there are no adverse effects the undertaking can&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;proceed based on written confirmation (``the SHPO letter)&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Agency must take into account ACHP comments before&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;proceeding.\36\ Involving ACHP usually adds substantially&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;to the time and effort needed to complete the Section 106&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;4b. How long can the Section 106 consultation process take for 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
these agencies?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. The length of time to complete the process varies depending 
on the size and complexity of the undertaking and whether or not the 
undertaking will have an adverse effect. In so far as I know there are 
no studies that can provide comprehensive statistics on the time 
required. In my experience, few Section 106 cases are completed in less 
than 3 months and it is not unusual for them to take three times that 
long.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="693" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The Wireless industry indicated in a recent filing with the FCC 
that the average time for tribal consultation, only one part of the 
process, was 110 days.\37\ I am aware of one unresolved Section 106 
case (the Hopewell Tower) at the FCC that goes back to 1987 and I have 
worked on several that required more than a year to complete.

Association in the Matter of Acceleration Wireless Broad Band 
Deployment by Removing Barriers to Infrastructure Investment, WT Docket 
No. 17-79,'' July 17, 2017, p. 4.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;If an adverse effect is found the timeline is extended depending on 
the nature of the effect and the complexity of the consultations 
required to find a mitigation strategy. My experience is that an 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
adverse effect adds at least 3 months and in many instances far more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="696" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;4c. What kind of difficulties might any delay in the Section 106 
process cause for project proponents hoping to get a permit or have 
their project approved?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="697" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. While several difficulties can arise three are most common.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="698" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Delayed comments: The most common delay occurs when&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;consulting parties opposed to the undertaking manipulate&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="700" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;either the ACHP or agency rules (or both) to create&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="701" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;procedural delays. This occurs frequently with tribes, many&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;of whom have difficulty meeting the standard 30-day&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;deadlines built into the process, or who insist that the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;agency/ applicant provided special information or employee&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;tribal members to gather information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="706" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Restarting the clock: Another common delaying tactic is&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="707" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;often referred to as ``restarting the clock.'' Several ACHP&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="708" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;rules as well as provisions in programmatic agreements set&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="709" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;deadlines. But these take effect only when the agency or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="710" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;its licensee/permittee has provided all the information. It&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="711" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;is not uncommon for SHPO/THPOs to restart the 30-day clock&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="712" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;by asking for additional information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="713" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Workloads: Workload issues in SHPO/THPO and even agency&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="714" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;preservation offices can and often do cause delays. The&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="715" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;THPO offices in particular are underfunded and large&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="716" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;undertakings like pipelines can overwhelm them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="717" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;While the foregoing descriptions are of specific difficulties that 
can cause delay, four other general impediments deserve mention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="718" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; General complexity: The maddeningly intricate nature of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="719" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;the Federal preservation system is a source of chronic&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="720" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;regulatory constipation. For example, ACHP rules and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="721" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;guidance often borders on the unintelligible as its July 6,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="722" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;2001 guidance Memorandum on Tribal fees and definition of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="723" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;adverse effect (36 CFR 800.5) aptly shows.\38\ While there&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="724" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;is a long back story to how and why these rules have&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="725" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;become, in the words of one Washington Attorney an arcane&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="726" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;area of regulation, the fact is the Federal preservation&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="727" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;program often leaves even those who value historic sites&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="728" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;bewildered.\39\ This introduces inefficiencies. No better&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="729" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;example can be pointed to than the ``Twilight Tower'' issue&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="730" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;that has bedogged both the FCC and ACHP for the better part&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="731" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;of a decade. Opening these towers for colocation would&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="732" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;reduce the need for new structures and hence serve&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="733" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;preservation interests, improve wireless service, and free&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="734" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;scarce resources. Even with such clear benefits obvious the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="735" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Federal preservation system has not countenanced&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="736" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;resolution.

Preservation Fund provided about half the funding for State Historic 
Preservation Offices and all the funding for Tribal Preservation

    &lt;paragraph paraId="756" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Section 106 in particular is a tangle of agendas. For&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="757" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;example, there are basic and conflicting differences in&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="766" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;is described, however, as ``a thumb on the preservation&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="767" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;side of the scales.'' \42\ Which is it? A neutral procedure&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="778" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Lack of evaluation: There is little ongoing evaluation of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="779" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Section 106 even though it widely understood to be misused.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="780" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;NPS collects data (annually) on both THPO and SHPO&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="781" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;performances but it is not used to evaluate that&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="782" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;performance in any meaningful way. For example, NPS data&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="783" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;shows a striking difference among SHPOs in the percentage&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="784" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;of undertakings that are determined to have an effect even&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="785" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;when state size, level of Federal spending, and history are&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="786" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;taken into account. (e.g. differences between Ohio and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="787" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Illinois). These differences are curious indeed since all&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="788" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;SHPOs should be applying the same criteria. To site another&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="789" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;example, no one seem to take notice of the fact (even&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="790" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;though the data was in NPS files) that over the 9-year&lt;/paragraph&gt;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="792" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;determinations but found only 4 to be adverse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="793" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;While it would be an exaggeration to describe Federal preservation 
as dysfunctional it clearly has problems that are apparent even to 
supporters. In 2011 Preservation Action, in conjunction with the

Commissions issued ``Recommendations to Increase the Effectiveness of

several questions.\44\ The following table from the Report, which 
summarizes their responses, reveals that preservationist themselves had

    &lt;paragraph paraId="795" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;.epsQuestion 5. In your testimony, you note that private industry 
as well as Federal, state, and local governments must spend money on 
``investigations'' in order to ensure that they are meeting their 
obligations under the National Historic Preservation Act as well as 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
related laws and regulations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="796" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. As background, the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation's rules contained in 36 CFR 800 and related policies 
require an agency to determine if an undertaking will affect sites 
listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic 
Places before authorizing the undertaking. While ACHP does not 
explicitly require studies the information it needs and the steps its 
process mandates, such as public input, essentially forces a study to 
be conducted before each Federal undertaking that has the potential to 
effect National Register sites.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="797" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;As a part of the process agencies and their licensees/permittee are 
required to consult with State and Tribal Historic Preservation 
Officers, who in turn report to the national Park Service on the number 
of Section 106 cases reviewed and their findings (i.e. weather not the 
undertaking has an effect on historic sites). These reports offer a 
window into the Section 106 process that reveals the following:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="798" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In the years between 2004 and 2014 State Preservation&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="799" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;officers reported an annual average of 115,773 cases.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="800" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Section 106 studies seldom find an adverse effect. For&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="801" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;example, the National Park service reported to Congress in&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="802" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;2012 that only 2 percent of the SHPO findings were&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="803" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;adverse.\45\ Figures from Tribal Preservation Offices&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="804" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;between 2006 and 2014 show that they have a 3.5 percent&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="805" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;average adverse effect determination.\46\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="809" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;in the National Register. For example, even though the&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="815" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;The ubiquity of Section 106, the infrequency with which it finds 
adverse effects, the costs, and its inability to produce for the 
National Register should be kept in mind while reading the answers to 
the following questions. As Section 106 has evolved it serves neither 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
preservation no those it regulates effectively.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="816" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;5a. What kind of services are they paying for as part of these 
investigations?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="817" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. Typically, agencies and their licensees/permittee have six 
types of expenses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="818" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Internal costs: Many agencies employee staff specifically&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="819" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;to undertake or manage Section 106 preservation&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="820" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;activities.\48\ This staff is a valid expenditure under&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="821" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;section 306102 of the NHPA and hence funded by Federal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="822" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;appropriations. In most instances, this staff serves as&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="823" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;manager of the agency's Section 106 compliance, including&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="824" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;the coordination and review of contractors' work, training&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="829" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;office functions cost. It is worth noting that past&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="830" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;congressional reports on the cost of the Federal&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="933" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;5b. Does this impose any hardship on smaller businesses or 
localities that have limited funding but that must work with the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Federal agencies as part of the Section 106 process?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="934" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Answer. I have no direct evidence of Section 106's financial impact 
on small businesses. In my experience, the most common hardship arises 
from the entanglement of Federal and local preservation rules. Ms. 
Patty Brandt, a fellow witness, discussed this issue in some detail and 
it should be noted that it was at the center of the Subcommittee on 
National Parks, Recreation, and Public Lands oversight hearing in 2003. 
Hence, the issue is not a new one but ACHP and NPS' failure to 
recognize that entanglement occurs persists.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="935" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;Another common hardship for private property owners and small 
business is what I call the ``Shadow Effect'' of Section 106. When 
evaluating the effect of an undertaking the agency must identify the 
Area of Potential Effect (APE), frequently a geographic area larger 
than the parcel on which the undertaking actually occurs. This 
effectively extends the reach of a historic site some distance and 
subjects the use of other property in the vicinity to the needs of 
historic sites and may limit the non-historic property's use. An 
example may best explain. A property owner entered into an agreement 
with a cellular company to erect a tower on his land. Research 
conducted for Section 106 found there to be no historic sites on the 
owner's property but a THPO identified ``substantial stone groupings'' 
on an adjacent property. To avoid costs associated with mitigation the 
cellular company abandoned the site. Hence, the presence of a nearby 
historic site effectively reduced the value of a non-historic 
property.\61\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="937" speaker="Dr. Loveday "&gt;If the ACHP succeeds in expanding its fee policy to require 
agencies to pay for Section 106 consultation and allows SHPOs as well 
as tribes to charge, small business and communities will certainly be 
impacted. Congress should look closely at such a change. Certainly, 
there should be a thorough review of the National Register Criteria,

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF PATTY BRANDT, RESIDENT, EASTMORELAND NEIGHBORHOOD,&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="PATTY BRANDT"&gt;The Chair now recognizes Ms. Brandt for her testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="PATTY BRANDT"&gt;                        PORTLAND, OREGON
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Brandt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;Mr. Chairman, thank you for inviting me to
testify. I represent an organization called Keep Eastmoreland 
Free, which has helped more than 1,000 property owners oppose 
the national historic district designation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;I believe that the National Historic Preservation Act is 
being abused at a local level, and I ask for your help to 
restore its local intent by Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;Discussions and decisions about urban density, growth, and 
historic preservation are best managed at the local level. 
Locally elected officials understand the complexities that each 
neighborhood faces. Unfortunately, some residents in Portland, 
Oregon are using the NHPA to bypass local process to force 
severe restrictions on private property rights.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;Under the NHPA, the listing of the neighborhood on the 
National Register is intended to be merely honorary. It is not 
intended to restrict what homeowners may do to their houses. 
Any person or group may nominate a neighborhood for national 
historic district listing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;To prevent listing, a majority (50 percent plus 1) of the 
homeowners must sign notarized letters of objection. Those 
homeowners, who are unwilling or unable to sign notarized 
letters, are deemed to consent to the listing. This assumed 
consent system is undemocratic. But it would be harmless if the 
listing is only honorific, as intended by Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;When you think of historic properties--and I have seen many 
this last weekend--you might envision a historic figure's home 
or gravesite. But my district of over 2,000 homes is facing 
potential historic district designation under the NHPA. If 
designated by the National Park Service, local officials in 
Oregon will be able to impose restrictions on my neighbors' 
abilities to improve, expand, tear down their homes or garages. 
About 80 percent of the homes will be expected to permanently 
preserve their appearance from the street.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;The local processes laid out by Federal law and regulation 
have been extremely frustrating. The State Historic 
Preservation Office still has not determined how many 
homeowners constitute 50 percent. One resident even went to 
state court and obtained a temporary stay against the SHPO 
because of procedural flaws and the trampling of individual 
property rights. That case is pending in state court, and the 
question of the 50 percent plus 1 supporting or opposing the 
designation is still in limbo.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;Even if residents are unable to provide sufficient 
opposition to the designation, the National Park Service must 
still review the application according to the criteria 
contained in Federal regulations. This includes significance in 
American history and architecture, among other things. I love 
my neighborhood, I have been there 43 years, but I feel that 
none of these Federal criteria are met in the Eastmoreland 
neighborhood.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;Let me explain. The Eastmoreland application includes an 
alleged historic period from 1910 to 1961. This wide and rather 
modern date range was probably chosen because many of the homes 
were built after World War II, yet they possess little, if any, 
historic significance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;You should have a picture in front of you of a house in my 
neighborhood. This house was built in 1951. Apparently, it is 
significant to American history and the historic nature of the 
neighborhood. The next house is a friend of mine's house, was 
built in 1947, also from the period of alleged historic 
significance. And the third, finally, another friend--it is a 
great house--was built around 1883. It is the oldest house in 
the neighborhood, but the historic district time period 
actually excludes homes this old.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;To me, this demonstrates the arbitrary nature of these 
designations. This simple gerrymandering is to subvert local 
planning processes. And we are not alone in Eastmoreland. 
Within the last year, three neighborhoods in Portland have 
filed or are pursuing historic district designation by the 
National Park Service. All of them are conscious efforts to 
bypass local planning decisions by moving the decision here, 
3,000 miles away, to a Federal agency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;Modest steps should be taken to ensure that the NHPA is not 
skewed or abused like this. My testimony goes into specifics, 
but the bottom line is that loopholes should be closed and this 
program restored to what it was intended to be. Historic 
designation should not be a back door to local zoning. The 
burden should be placed on those supporting the designation, 
rather than those who oppose it. There should be sideboards 
placed on the size of historic districts, or a greater 
percentage of residents to support the designation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Ms. Brandt follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Thank you very much for the opportunity and the honor to 
testify today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Prepared Statement of Patty Brandt, Resident, Eastmoreland&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Neighborhood,Portland, Oregon&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;My name is Patty Brandt and I represent an organization called Keep 
Eastmoreland Free, which helped more than 1,040 property owners oppose 
a National Historic District designation of the Eastmoreland 
neighborhood in Portland, Oregon. I thank the Subcommittee for holding 
this important hearing to examine how the National Historic 
Preservation Act is being abused at a local level and identify 
potential remedies to restore its original intent by Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;background&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Portland, Oregon, is growing at a rapid rate--about 111 people move 
there each day. The city and state also have landmark urban growth 
boundaries that cause us to have regular debates about urban density 
and how to accommodate this growth and protect visual and historic 
legacies--all while providing affordable housing to working class 
individuals and families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;I believe that these discussions and decisions are best managed at 
the local level. Locally elected officials understand the complexities 
that each neighborhood faces. Unfortunately, some residents are using 
the National Historic Preservation Act to bypass these local processes 
to force severe restrictions on private property rights and prevent 
much needed urban infill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;From the outset, I want to say that our concern is about the local 
abuse of the Federal law and we hope to have a positive conversation 
with the National Park Service about our situation. That being said, I 
do believe that the regulations and statute should be improved to 
prevent local manipulation of the program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;designation process&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;The National Historic Preservation Act created the National 
Register of Historic Places, which is overseen by the National Park 
Service. This list includes districts, sites, buildings, structures, 
and objects worthy of preservation. To be eligible for listing they 
must meet certain criteria.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Under Federal law, the listing of a neighborhood on the National 
Register of Historic Places is intended to be merely honorary. It is 
not intended to restrict what homeowners may do with their houses. Any 
person or group may nominate a neighborhood for national historic 
district listing. To prevent listing, a majority (50 percent + 1 
person) of the homeowners must sign notarized objection letters. In 
contrast, all homeowners who are unwilling or unable to sign notarized 
objection letters are deemed to consent to the listing. This assumed 
consent system is undemocratic, but does no harm if the only effect of 
the listing is honorific, as intended by Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Unfortunately, the listing of an Oregon neighborhood as a national 
historic district does not end up being merely honorary. In Oregon, any 
person or a minority of neighbors may use the national historic 
district listing process, including its assumed consent system, to 
restrict what all of their neighbors may do with their houses in 
perpetuity. This is undemocratic and unfair. The NHPA was never 
designed to permit that to happen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;My neighborhood is facing a potential ``historic district'' 
designation impacting around 2,000 homeowners. If designated by the 
National Park Service, this means that local officials will be able to 
impose restrictions on neighbors' ability to improve, expand, or tear 
down their homes or garages. About 80 percent of the homes will be 
expected to permanently preserve their appearance from the street--
hampering or preventing most exterior alterations and redevelopment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;This is how the process unfolded:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Last year, the board of directors of the Eastmoreland Neighborhood 
Association, which has no governing authority over Eastmorelanders, 
made a unilateral decision to pursue listing the Neighborhood in the 
National Register of Historic Places solely as a land use tool to fend 
off new development, block density, and preserve the single-family 
character of existing and future homes. One board member of the 
neighborhood association stated: ``We have reached now for a tool . . . 
the historic preservation district, that's an imprecise tool, it was 
designed for something else . . . but it is . . . our only option to 
slow down . . . it doesn't prevent demolition in some ways . . . but if 
you look at neighborhoods that become historic districts, they don't 
have our problems.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;In other words, proponents of historic district designation have 
acknowledged that the law was intended for other purposes. Take for 
example the beloved ``Father of Oregon''--Dr. John McLoughlin. A bronze 
statue of him represents Oregon across the street from us here, in the 
Capitol Visitors Center. Back home, his gravesite and modest home in 
Oregon City are listed on the National Register--as they should be. He 
was central to the history of our state. It makes good sense for his 
gravesite and home to be preserved as an historic treasure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;But that is not what is happening with my neighborhood. Rather, we 
have about 1,700 homes, built in a variety of styles over many decades. 
The process could not be more frustrating. Once the neighborhood 
association filed the application for listing, it started a process 
with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). This process 
includes notifying homeowners of the nomination and the process for 
submitting objections. From the outset, there were concerns about the 
historic nature of the neighborhood, the underlying survey of the area, 
and the process. In a February 2016 vote, the majority of neighborhood 
residents voted in opposition to the historic district designation. Yet 
that same month, the State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation 
rubber-stamped its support of the designation. This Committee is 
separate from the SHPO, and advises the SHPO on National Register 
nominations. Can you see how the process is already getting 
complicated?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Then the SHPO itself had to make a decision based on Federal law. 
First and foremost, the SHPO is required to determine whether a 
majority of the homeowners object to listing. This means 50 percent of 
the homeowners, plus 1 more. The SHPO has had difficulty figuring out 
what that number is, even though a mailed poll determined that a 
majority of homeowners opposed. The SHPO received at least 1,040 
notarized objections by June 30 of this year, which was more than 
SHPO's own threshold, and the process should have stopped right then 
and there. This process of gauging support is so convoluted that a 
resident went to court and obtained a temporary stay against the SHPO, 
because of the inherent flaws in its process and the trampling of 
individual property rights. His case is pending in state court.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;The SHPO sent the National Park Service the historic district 
nomination without a recommendation to designate--but only because it 
couldn't determine if a majority of residents opposed or supported the 
designation. In my mind, the whole process should have stopped there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;If we are unable to prove sufficient opposition to the designation, 
the National Park Service still must review the application according 
to the criteria contained in Federal regulations developed to implement 
the National Historic Preservation Act:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;The quality of significance in American history, architecture,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;archeology, engineering, and culture is present in districts,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;feeling, and association, and:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;A.  That are associated with events that have made a&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;B.  That are associated with the lives of significant persons&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;in our past; or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;C.  That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;period, or method of construction, or that represent the work&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;components may lack individual distinction; or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;D.  That have yielded or may be likely to yield, information&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;important in history or prehistory.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;I love my neighborhood, but not a single one of these criteria is 
met in the Eastmoreland neighborhood. The application for designation 
includes an alleged ``historic'' period from 1910-1961. This wide date 
range was probably chosen because many of the homes were built after 
World War II. Yet they possess little, if any, historic significance. 
Ironically, the time period for the designation excludes the oldest 
house in the neighborhood, which was built in 1882.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;This demonstrates the arbitrary nature of these designations and 
reveals that they're simple gerrymandering to subvert local planning 
decisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;copycat designations&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Within the last year, three neighborhoods in Portland have filed 
petitions for historic district designation by the National Park 
Service: Eastmoreland, Laurelhurst, and Peacock Lane. Each of these is 
clearly and publicly motivated by efforts to curb development, 
renovation, or demolition. All are conscious efforts to bypass local 
planning decisions by moving the decision 3,000 miles away to a Federal 
agency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;possible remedies and reforms&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;I believe that Congress and the National Park Service can and 
should take modest steps to ensure that the National Historic 
Preservation Act is not skewed and abused as it is in Oregon. These 
actions would include:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Amending the NHPA to extend or alter the 45-day window for&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;the Secretary of the Interior to make a decision with&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;respect to a designation. For large ``district''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;designations covering hundreds of homes, this time period&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;is too short for the National Park Service to conduct a&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;thorough evaluation of the designation criteria;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Amending the NHPA to shift the burden to those property&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;owners supporting the designation, rather than those&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;opposing it. In addition, when a historic designation will&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;impact the rights of property owners, the threshold for&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;designation should be greater than 50 percent + 1 showing&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;support. I believe that two-thirds of property owners&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;within a proposed historic district should have the burden&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;of showing support in order for the National Park Service&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;to consider the nomination.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Implementation regulations (36 C.F.R. Sec. 60.1-.15)&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;should be amended to:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;&amp;lt;SUP&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/SUP&amp;gt;  Allow the National Park Service to consider&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;whether the nomination is motivated primarily by an effort to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;alter local zoning or planning restrictions. After all, these&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;designations are supposed to be honorary and to benefit--not&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;punish--property owners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;&amp;lt;SUP&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/SUP&amp;gt;  Clarify the calculation of a ``majority'' of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;landowners and how and when they are counted. The confusion&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;demonstrated by the SHPO indicates that clarity is warranted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;&amp;lt;SUP&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/SUP&amp;gt;  Eliminate the requirement of the Keeper of the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;National Register to review the nomination and keep it on file&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;even when a majority of property owners object to the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;designation. (36 CFR Sec. 60.6(s)). As currently drafted, it&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;potentially opens up a perpetual fight amongst landowners to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;obtain notarized signatures either supporting or opposing the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;designation. The regulations should require the National Park&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Service to make one decision at the time of filing, not have an&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;open-ended process. If a majority of property owners object&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;before the time of filing, the National Park Service should not&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;review the petition or keep it on file for future reference.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;The petition can and should be re-filed if and when a majority&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;(or two-thirds as I suggest) of property owners actually and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;affirmatively support the designation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;&amp;lt;SUP&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/SUP&amp;gt;  Limits should be placed on the size of historic&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;district designations. One thousand homes is excessive. One&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;option would be for the National Park Service to publish an&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit public&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;comment on potential changes to these regulations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;With only a few changes, the NHPA can be kept from going astray any 
further. I hope that you will do so, and soon. Thank you very much for 
the opportunity and the honor to testify before you today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. Brandt "&gt;                                 --------

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF AMANDA C. LEITER, PROFESSOR, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY,&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="AMANDA C. LEITER"&gt;The Chair now recognizes Ms. Leiter for her testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="AMANDA C. LEITER"&gt;           WASHINGTON COLLEGE OF LAW, WASHINGTON, DC
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member McEachin,
members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to 
testify. My name is Amanda Leiter, and I am a Professor at 
American University's Washington College of Law. From August 
2015 to January 2017, I was a Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Land and Minerals at the U.S. Department of the Interior, 
working with DOI's mineral management agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;I want to take a step back and address the premise of this 
hearing. Laws can always be improved, but I disagree that our 
natural resources laws have gone astray. On the contrary, those 
laws create an unusually balanced and participatory resource 
management regime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;As development and climate pressures mount, agencies must 
manage our resources for the benefit of all Americans, 
balancing uses like grazing, timber and mineral production, 
renewable energy generation, water supply, and preservation of 
sacred sites, wildlife, and wilderness. These uses often 
conflict. As a result, agencies must manage for multiple use 
across all areas, even as they choose which uses to prioritize 
in particular areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;The prioritization decisions are controversial, and must be 
made acre by acre and state by state. There is no one-size-
fits-all answer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;The Obama administration worked hard to ensure an inclusive 
process that achieved balance among competing demands. To take 
just a few examples between 2009 and 2016, DOI issued oil and 
gas leases on 31 million new acres on and offshore, approved 60 
new renewable energy projects, and protected millions of acres 
of public lands on and offshore.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;The result is a balanced record of which I am proud: on the 
one hand, a variety of protections for special places; on the 
other hand, a streamlined permitting process for drilling, and 
reduced conflict over mineral development in suitable areas. 
These balanced outcomes resulted from the Administration's 
commitment to the openness and public involvement required by 
the Administrative Procedure Act and the natural resources 
laws.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;For example, I worked with the Bureau of Land Management to 
develop its rule to reduce methane waste from oil and gas 
operators. Before I arrived, the Bureau had already conducted 
one round of public outreach meetings. While I was there, we 
held public and tribal meetings in four states, took dozens of 
meetings with companies, trade associations, and NGOs, reviewed 
more than 330,000 public comments, and amended the rule in 
response to comments received.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;I should also emphasize, in my experience, although career 
staff at DOI vary in their personal politics, they shared our 
commitment to sound decision making and to the sustainable 
management of America's public resources.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;Unfortunately, the Trump administration and Secretary Zinke 
seem to have abandoned this commitment to balance and openness, 
in favor of listening only to industry stakeholders. I was 
pleased by Secretary Zinke's commitment this morning to keep 
public lands public. But a recent Washington Post review of his 
calendar revealed that over 2 months this spring, he held 
numerous meetings with energy industry executives. Meanwhile, 
he has suspended meetings of the BLM's 30 resource advisory 
committees, which are intended to give the Department balanced 
input from local stakeholders across the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;Every DOI decision cannot be popular with everyone. But I 
submit that an unpopular decision is not evidence of natural 
resources laws gone astray. If an agency has over-reached its 
statutory authority, acted arbitrarily, or failed to follow 
required procedures, affected parties have a remedy in court. 
Otherwise, disagreement with the actions of a prior 
administration is just that: evidence of shifting political 
priorities, not of wrongdoing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;By contrast, as the courts are beginning to remind this 
Administration, the current trend toward increased secrecy and 
one-sided decision making is a recipe for agency over-reach and 
for natural resource management agencies to go astray. If the 
trend continues, I predict that the Trump administration 
reforms will be tied up in courts for years, and industry will 
not get the change it seeks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;Finally, as the Ranking Member noted, there is an elephant 
in the room: climate change. There is no remaining doubt that 
human-induced climate change will profoundly affect us for 
generations, particularly vulnerable populations. That should 
be this Committee's focus, not a search for alleged missteps by 
the past administration. If we fail to address that looming 
threat, history will not judge us kindly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Ms. Leiter follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.
Prepared Statement of Amanda C. Leiter, Professor, American University 
 Washington College of Law; Former Deputy Assistant Secretary, Land &amp;amp;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Minerals Management, U.S. Department of the Interior (2015-2017)
Introduction&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to testify on our natural resources 
laws.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;The United States is fortunate to have abundant natural resources, 
both on- and offshore. The public owns these resources, and they must 
be managed for the benefit of all Americans. Congress has delegated 
that task to a variety of resource management agencies, and those 
agencies have, in turn, promulgated regulations to implement their 
management responsibilities. The other witnesses are going to discuss 
specific natural resources laws and regulations, but I want to take a 
step back and address the overall premise of this hearing. While laws 
can always be refined and improved, I strongly disagree that our 
natural resources laws have gone astray. In fact, our legal framework 
for managing public resources is one of the most balanced, open, and 
participatory regimes in the world. I'd like to make five points about 
that regime.
1. The Obama administration sought to balance the many competing&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;demands on our public land, air, water, wildlife, and mineral&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;resources.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Pressures on the United States' natural resources increase daily, 
as our population grows (particularly in the West), extraction 
technologies improve, and droughts, severe storms, and other climate 
threats increase. We can no longer simply adopt a first-come-first-
served approach, as we arguably could in the days of the gold rush. 
Rather, we must manage for the benefit of all Americans, balancing 
multiple, often competing natural resource uses, including recreation; 
grazing; timber production; coal, oil, and gas production; hardrock 
mining; solar and wind power generation; clean water supply; protection 
of sacred sites; and wildlife and wilderness preservation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;The Obama administration worked hard to balance these competing 
demands. To take just a few examples from the Department of the 
Interior, the Obama administration between 2009-2016 issued oil and gas 
leases on 10.8 million new acres onshore, and 20.2 million new acres 
offshore; instituted large scale land planning reforms, to designate 
areas most suitable for mineral development and thereby resolve 
conflicts prior to issuance of lease sales; upgraded the automated oil 
and gas information tracking system, to reduce the processing time for 
permits to drill; approved 60 new solar, wind, and geothermal energy 
projects, capable of producing more than 15,000 megawatts of renewable 
power; protected over 5 million acres of public lands onshore, and even 
more acreage offshore; and worked with state agencies, oil and gas 
producers, conservationists, outdoor recreation groups, and others to 
keep the greater sage grouse from being federally listed as a 
threatened or endangered species.
2. Because natural resource uses often conflict, resource management&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;agencies cannot allow all uses in every area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;As the Obama administration recognized, each acre of public lands 
or waters is not suitable for every use. Rather, agencies must manage 
for multiple uses in the aggregate, across all managed areas, even as 
they confront very difficult decisions about which uses to prioritize 
in particular areas. Should grazing be allowed near salmon streams? 
Should wind turbines be constructed near eagle nests? Should seismic 
testing occur in marine mammal habitat? Should off-road vehicle use be 
allowed in areas criss-crossed with hiking and horse trails?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;These questions principally illustrate the conflict between 
conservation interests and development interests, but development 
interests may also conflict with each other. For example, in Colorado, 
the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is collaborating with South Park 
County to manage oil and gas development so as to protect the water 
supplies for the burgeoning cities of Denver and Aurora. Similarly, in 
New Mexico and Utah, the BLM has worked to balance potash development 
and oil and gas development, which cannot co-exist on the surface of 
the same lands at the same time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Questions about which uses to prioritize are difficult and 
controversial, and they must be answered acre by acre, parcel by 
parcel, county by county, and state by state. There is no one-size-
fits-all answer. Rather, resource management agencies must consider the 
nature of the resources in the affected area, the potential impacts of 
the proposed activities, the availability of suitable mitigation, and 
the desires and concerns of all affected people and entities.
3. Congress has outlined the procedures that agencies must follow to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;regulate resource use, withdraw lands, or make leasing or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;permitting decisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;The Administrative Procedure Act and the various natural resources 
laws mandate procedures that agencies must follow in making decisions 
about resource uses. Those procedures vary from statute to statute and 
resource to resource, but four central tenets cut across all contexts: 
a sound scientific foundation, openness, transparency, and public 
involvement. With very few exceptions, the agencies cannot allow, 
disallow, or restrict a resource use without consulting with 
scientists, engineers, and other agency experts; issuing a public 
proposal; taking comment from affected people and entities; considering 
all the comments received; revisiting the proposal; and issuing a final 
decision that is reasonable and takes adequate account of the comments 
received. In some cases, statutes also require that the agencies hold 
extensive public meetings with affected parties, including state 
governments, tribes, and local populations. In short, absolutely 
nothing happens in secret.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Adherence to these procedures allows for the involvement of all 
stakeholders. The final decision may still be unpopular with some--that 
is the nature of balancing competing and conflicting resource uses. But 
in almost every case, if the agency follows the required procedures, 
affected parties have an opportunity to learn in advance of the 
agencies' plans, and to provide feedback and concrete suggestions on 
those plans. The procedures ensure that our bureaucracy is responsive 
to the public will. And if the majority of the public continues to 
object to the agencies' choices, the public has a chance to change 
agencies' policy direction through Presidential elections
4. In my experience during the last 18 months of the Obama&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;administration, the Department of the Interior took openness,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;transparency, and public involvement quite seriously.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;President Obama pledged that his administration would be the ``most 
transparent'' administration in U.S. history, and would ``create `an 
unprecedented level of openness.' '' Reviews of the administration's 
overall record on this issue are mixed, but in my experience both the 
political and the career staff at the Department of the Interior worked 
diligently to base all final resource management decisions on (1) sound 
science; (2) input from all affected constituencies, including states, 
tribes, local governments, industry, NGOs, and the public; and (3) the 
wise counsel of our solicitor's office concerning our compliance with 
our procedural (and substantive) legal obligations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;For example, I worked with the BLM to develop its final rule to 
reduce methane waste from oil and gas operations on public lands (known 
as the ``Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and 
Resource Conservation Rule,'' and issued on November 18, 2016). In the 
18 months that I worked with the agency, we conducted public meetings 
in four states, at which we heard from hundreds of industry employees 
and local citizens; we held four tribal outreach meetings; we took 
dozens of meetings with individual companies and industry trade 
associations; we took a similar number of meetings with NGOs; we 
extended the comment period in response to requests from industry; we 
reviewed more than 330,000 written comments from the public, of which 
approximately 1,000 were unique; and we met weekly with representatives 
from our Solicitor's Office. Moreover, before I arrived in August 2015, 
the BLM had already engaged in one round of public outreach, issuing an 
advanced notice of proposed rulemaking and conducting a serious of 
public and tribal meetings, and focused meetings with industry and 
NGOs, input from which shaped the original draft rule.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Once the extended comment period ended in the summer of 2016, we 
worked closely with our solicitors to amend the rule in response to 
comments received. Industry let us know, for example, that regular leak 
inspections would be quite costly, particularly for smaller operators, 
so we worked to develop a less onerous leak detection and repair 
program, and added a provision that allows operators to request BLM 
approval of an alternative program in certain circumstances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Secretary Sally Jewell's actions ahead of President Obama's 
designation of Bears Ears National Monument likewise illustrate the 
Obama administration's commitment to openness and public involvement. 
The administration waited to make a final decision about the monument 
until after Secretary Jewell engaged with stakeholders on both sides of 
the controversial designation. Specifically, prior to the designation, 
Secretary Jewell traveled--with members of the press--across more than 
800 miles of Utah canyon lands; hosted a 3-hour public listening 
session attended by more than 1,500 people; and spent days meeting with 
Utah's governor, staff members for Utah's congressional delegation, 
state legislators, commissioners from three counties, chairmen and 
council members from at least five tribes, energy industry 
representatives, ranchers, and NGOs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Overall, the political staff at DOI took the commitment to a sound 
decision-making process quite seriously. Moreover, in my experience, 
the agency's career staff shared that commitment. Most of these 
engineers, scientists, lawyers, and other professionals chose to work 
in the Department of the Interior--often at lower pay than they would 
receive in the private sector--because they believe in the agency's 
mission. That does not mean they share a point of view; career 
officials at the Department vary widely in their political 
affiliations. But they share a dedication to the wise and sustainable 
management of our public resources.
5. A commitment to open, transparent, and science-based decision making&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;is the only way to ensure balanced resource management&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;decisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;As noted above, during the Obama administration, the Department of 
the Interior engaged in a disciplined and open decision-making process 
in determining how to manage the Nation's natural resources for the 
benefit of all Americans. The result is a balanced record of which I am 
proud--on the one hand, millions of acres protected from development, 
on the other, reduced conflict over mineral development in other, more 
suitable areas; on the one hand, millions of stream miles protected by 
buffer zones, on the other, an easier process by which energy 
developers can demonstrate compliance with the Endangered Species Act 
and Migratory Bird Treaty Act; on the one hand, limits on venting, 
flaring, and leaks from oil and gas wells, on the other, a streamlined 
process for obtaining a permit to drill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Unfortunately, the Trump administration and Secretary Zinke seem to 
have abandoned the Obama administration's balanced approach, and its 
commitment to openness, transparency, and sound science, in favor of 
listening and responding only to industry stakeholders. A recent 
Washington Post review of Secretary Zinke's calendar revealed that over 
March and April of this year, he held more than a half-dozen meetings 
with executives from oil and gas firms, including BP America, Chevron 
and ExxonMobil. He also met with the American Petroleum Institute, the 
Western Energy Alliance, and Continental Resources. The calendars 
reveal that the discussions covered actions that Secretary Zinke later 
took to reverse Obama-era policies, including an order purporting to 
postpone certain requirements of the methane waste rule on which I 
worked. Meanwhile, representatives from environmental NGOs report more 
difficulty obtaining access.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Comparing Secretary Zinke's trip to Utah to ``review'' the Bears 
Ears monument designation with Secretary Jewell's trip prior to the 
designation is also revelatory: according to the Salt Lake Tribune, 
Secretary Zinke held only two ``meetings with pro-monument activists 
during his visit--the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition and Friends of 
Cedar Mesa--for a total of about an hour and a half, while he traveled 
extensively with anti-monument heavyweights.'' Likewise, he ``offered 
little media availability outside of daily briefings, and no public 
meetings.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Meanwhile, in early May, Secretary Zinke suspended the upcoming 
meetings of the BLM's 30 Resource Advisory Councils (RAC). Established 
in 1995, these RACs each comprise 10-15 members from diverse interests 
in local communities, including state and local government officials, 
tribal members, ranchers, and environmental groups. The RACs are 
intended to provide the BLM with input on the agency's initiatives, 
regulatory proposals, and policy changes--input that Secretary Zinke 
now will not receive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Finally, even the Trump administration's requests for public 
involvement serve to decrease rather than increase regulatory 
transparency. Take, for example, the Administration's regulatory reform 
agenda to ``alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the 
American people.'' Each agency is charged with implementing this agenda 
in its own regulatory sphere. The Department of the Interior's public 
notice requesting comment on regulatory reform states that the agency 
is ``seeking public input on how it can best'' identify regulations for 
``repeal, replacement or modification.'' The notice then lists a series 
of criteria that might qualify an existing regulation for repeal--if 
the regulation eliminates jobs or inhibits job creation, if it is (in 
the commenter's view) ineffective or unnecessary, if it imposes costs 
that (in the commenter's view) exceed its benefits. In essence, the 
notice asks regulated entities to submit their wish list for rule 
revocation, and provides them with a checklist of rationales to support 
that revocation, but provides rule beneficiaries with no indication of 
which rules are likely to be targeted or how best to submit evidence to 
support the need to keep certain rules on the books.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;I recognize that some of the Department of the Interior's decisions 
during the Obama administration were unpopular with some members of 
this Committee, and with your constituencies. Unfortunately, that is 
inevitable, given that the Department's task is to balance multiple 
competing and conflicting demands on public resources. It's impossible 
to make everyone happy. But I submit that an unpopular decision is not 
evidence of agency over-reach, nor of natural resources laws ``gone 
astray.'' If an agency has in fact over-reached its statutory authority 
or failed to follow required procedures, then affected parties have a 
remedy in court. But short of that, disagreement with the actions of a 
prior administration from a different party is just that: evidence of 
shifting political priorities, not of wrongdoing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;On the other hand, the trend in the current Administration--toward 
increased secrecy and one-sided decision making--is a recipe for agency 
over-reach and for natural resource management to ``go astray.'' 
Consistent failure to engage in an open and transparent decision-making 
process, consistent failure to consult with unbiased scientists in 
assessing policy choices, insistence on meeting only (or mostly) with 
industry representatives and not with other stakeholders, unilateral 
and process-less postponement of regulatory requirements that are 
validly in force--those actions are evidence of unreasoned decision 
making and over-reach, as courts like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia Circuit are already beginning to remind the 
agency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;I would advise the regulated industries, therefore, to watch what 
you wish for from this Administration. You may find yourself 
confronting serious litigation delays if you continue to push your wish 
list and fail to remind the agency of its statutory responsibility to 
manage our natural resources for the benefit of all Americans, via an 
open, transparent, and scientifically sound process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Last, I cannot in good conscience occupy this witness seat without 
addressing the elephant in the room. The single greatest threat to the 
United States' resource wealth is climate change and associated 
resource depletion. There is simply no remaining doubt that human-
induced climate change will profoundly affect us all. Devastating 
floods are increasing in frequency; increasing droughts are affecting 
the availability of water for drinking, agriculture, and fish habitat; 
shifting climatic zones are impacting crop production; expanding beetle 
ranges threaten forest resources; and warming and acidifying oceans are 
likely to decimate fisheries stocks. Rather than engaging in a 
misguided and ill-intentioned hunt for natural resources laws that have 
allegedly ``gone astray,'' this Committee should focus its attention on 
these very real threats to America's natural resource wealth, and 
indeed to our way of life. If we fail to address these threats, history 
will not judge us kindly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Questions Submitted by Rep. McEachin&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Question. Does peer-reviewed published research exist that 
demonstrates the impacts of seismic airgun noise on marine life? If so, 
what are some examples of the best available science on this issue?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Answer. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this topic. As I 
am not an expert in this area, I have consulted with several experts at 
Duke University, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Oceana and 
provide this response with their assistance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Yes, a substantial body of peer-reviewed research demonstrates that 
seismic airgun noise can negatively affect marine life, including 
whales and other marine mammals, fish, and zooplankton and other 
invertebrates. Many marine species depend on hearing as their primary 
sensory modality, and the introduction of powerful airgun noise 
fundamentally alters their environment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;For example, seismic airgun noise causes whales to stop producing 
vocalizations essential to breeding success, individual and cooperative 
foraging, predator avoidance, and mother-calf interactions. In the 
great baleen whales--many of which are considered endangered species--
this impact has repeatedly been demonstrated to occur on a vast scale, 
on an order in some cases of 100,000 square kilometers or more around a 
single seismic array, and across a range of behavioral states (feeding, 
breeding, and migrating). As some of these studies note, such impacts 
extend across a spatial scale sufficient to affect populations.\1\

thresholds, PLoS ONE 10(6): e0125720 (2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Seismic airgun surveys are also known to adversely affect marine 
mammals in numerous other ways. For example, airgun surveys directly 
disrupt foraging in marine mammal species as disparate as sperm whales 
and harbor porpoises, resulting in substantially compromised feeding 
success even at relatively low levels of exposure.\2\ They drastically 
shrink the space within which whales can communicate with others of 
their species, creating what biologists and acousticians have called an 
``acoustic smog'' that interferes with foraging, breeding, and other 
essential behavior at distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometers 
from individual surveys.\3\ And they can cause a variety of other 
impacts from hearing loss to habitat displacement.\4\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;In fish, seismic surveys are known to cause widespread behavioral 
disruption, such as by causing fish abundance on coral reefs to plummet 
during seismic exploration, even during periods when fish habitat use 
is typically greatest.\5\ Not only can this redistribution compromise 
life-history behaviors in fish, it can also interfere with fisheries. 
Fishermen have complained for decades of loss of catch when seismic 
airgun surveys move into an area, and airguns have been shown to 
dramatically decrease catch rates of various commercial and 
recreational fish species, (such as cod, haddock, pollock, and tuna), 
by as much as 80 percent and over thousands of square kilometers around 
a single array.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;In both fish and invertebrates, seismic airguns have been shown to 
damage hearing and sensory ability, impede larval development, induce 
stress, interrupt vital behaviors, and cause mortality. Impacts have 
been seen in species as diverse as salmon, snapper, and scallops.\7\ 
For example, in one important recent study, zooplankton--the foundation 
of the ocean food web--were found to decline by up to 50 percent or 
more, in more than half the zooplankton species examined, within a 1.5-
mile swath around a single, moderately sized airgun source. Krill 
larvae were completely wiped out by that source. In the words of the 
study's authors, these findings have ``enormous ramifications for 
larval recruitment processes, all higher order predators, and ocean 
life in general.'' \8\

    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;On March 5, 2015, 75 marine scientists, including leading experts 
in marine bioacoustics from Cornell, Duke, and other major research 
institutions, submitted a letter to the Federal Government expressing 
concern that Atlantic seismic surveys could compromise the population 
health of marine mammals, fish, and marine invertebrates. Based on the 
available literature, the scientists warned that seismic surveying ``is 
likely to have significant, long-lasting and widespread impacts on the 
reproduction and survival of fish and marine mammal populations in the 
region.'' In their letter, the scientists maintain, ``Opening the U.S. 
east coast to seismic airgun exploration poses an unacceptable risk of 
serious harm to marine life at the species and population levels, the 
full extent of which will not be understood until long after the harm 
occurs.'' \9\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Despite the substantial body of research showing that seismic 
airgun surveys can harm a diversity of marine life, the International 
Association of Geophysical Contractors and others continue to make 
statements such as the following statement in Ms. Martin's testimony to 
this Committee: ``As the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and 
the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have continually stated 
time and time again . . . to date, there has been no documented 
scientific evidence of noise from acoustic sources used in seismic 
activities adversely affecting marine animal populations or coastal 
communities.'' Ms. Martin cites the Science Note posted by BOEM on 
August 22, 2014, which states: ``To date, there has been no documented 
scientific evidence of noise from air guns used in geological and 
geophysical (G&amp;amp;G) seismic activities adversely affecting marine animal 
populations or to commercial fishing.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;In a later Science Note from March 9, 2015, however, BOEM stated 
that the Bureau ``does not and should not assume that lack of evidence 
for adverse population-level effects of air gun surveys means that 
those effects may not occur.'' Moreover, the 2014 statement is 
incomplete and misleading for several reasons:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The statement fails to mention that no scientific studies&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;even purport to evaluate population level effects from&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;sound impacts of seismic surveying on marine mammals or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;other marine animals--because it is difficult if not&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;impossible to determine impacts on an entire population.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Indeed, a NOAA paper concluded that, at present monitoring&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;levels, we have a less than 50 percent chance of detecting&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;a catastrophic decline in the majority of marine mammal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;populations off the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The statement omits the obvious lesson from the peer-&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;reviewed scientific literature noted above: that seismic&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;testing disrupts vital functions in marine mammals (and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;other species), including endangered species of whales, at&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;scales at which population-level impacts are likely. BOEM&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;itself estimates that the introduction of seismic surveys&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;in the Atlantic would have widespread impacts on marine&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;mammals, including up to 13.5 million instances of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;behavioral disruption, should seismic surveys begin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The statement ignores the fact that the loss of even one&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;North Atlantic right whale, an iconic, endangered east-&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;coast species that is presently in decline, could&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;jeopardize the survivability of the population. Given right&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;surveys on baleen whales, a group of 28 experts stated last&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;year that ``[t]he additional stress of widespread seismic&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;airgun surveys may well represent a tipping point for the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;survival of this endangered whale, contributing&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;significantly to a decline toward extinction.'' \10\&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;Moreover, a paper currently in press, by Pace, et al.,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;finds with 99.99 percent confidence that the whales'&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;In conclusion, scientific studies conclusively show that seismic 
testing causes harm to marine mammals, fish, invertebrates, sea 
turtles, and zooplankton. Statements by the IAGC and others that 
Atlantic seismic surveys will not be harmful, comparing this activity, 
for example, to ``ultrasound technology,'' are not only bereft of any 
scientific support, they are flatly contradicted by peer-reviewed 
scientific studies, and they are profoundly misleading.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Ms. Leiter "&gt;A fundamental purpose of the Marine Mammal Protection Act is to 
help ensure that marine mammals are not significantly harmed by human 
activities. 16 U.S.C. 1361(1),(2). The ``primary objective'' of marine 
mammal management under the Act is to ``maintain the health and 
stability of the marine ecosystem.'' 16 U.S.C. 1361(6). Given the 
overwhelming scientific evidence of harm inflicted on marine mammals 
and other forms of ocean life by seismic testing noise, it is fully 
consistent with the Act for the government to engage in a careful 
scientific review of applications to shoot seismic surveys off the U.S. 
coast, and to require that the impacts of any permitted seismic 
activity are mitigated to the greatest extent practicable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF NIKKI MARTIN, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="NIKKI MARTIN"&gt;The Chair now recognizes Ms. Martin for 5 minutes for her 
testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="NIKKI MARTIN"&gt;           OF GEOPHYSICAL CONTRACTORS, HOUSTON, TEXAS
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member McEachin,
and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity 
to testify. My name is Nikki Martin, and I am the President of 
the International Association of Geophysical Contractors. I 
testify today on behalf of IAGC's members, who represent the 
first step in global energy exploration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;Seismic surveying is a well understood and environmentally 
safe industry practice. Informed decisions regarding offshore 
energy development can only be made with evaluation provided by 
modern seismic data. It is for this very reason that the 
seismic survey permitting process has been politicized actively 
under the pretense of alleged harm to marine mammals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;The Marine Mammal Protection Act, or MMPA, was enacted in 
1972, and, as with many environmental statutes of that era, was 
passed with good intentions. While there will always be 
exceptions, such as the loss of the Chinese River baiji 
dolphin, and the current peril of the Mexican vaquita, both 
victims of illegal, destructive fishing practices, the MMPA has 
been a success. The statute boasts a long list of recoveries 
and increased marine mammal populations alongside continuous 
seismic surveying here in the United States and around the 
world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;Populations that were considered robust remain robust, and 
species protected from commercial exploitation and high rates 
of fishery by-catch have recovered faster than expected, with 
no apparent variation in populations with or without seismic 
surveys.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;The irony today is that a law never intended to regulate 
sound in the ocean is now applied primarily to regulate sound-
generating activities. It has been exploited to delay and 
impede seismic and exploration, which has no known proven 
impact to marine life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;As the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National 
Marine Fisheries Service have continually stated time and time 
again throughout changing political administrations, seismic 
surveys have been used in U.S. waters for over 50 years. To 
date, there has been no documented scientific evidence of sound 
from acoustic sources adversely affecting marine animal 
populations, commercial fishing, or coastal communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;The reality is that the seismic industry has a long track 
record of safe, responsible operations. Unfortunately, the 
permitting of the surveys critical to identifying the Nation's 
energy supplies is too often stalled or impeded by abuse of 
existing regulation and litigation. At IAGC, I have seen 
firsthand the detrimental impacts of non-transparent and 
delayed decision making stemming from the MMPA, as it is 
administered by agencies and exploited by advocacy groups in 
ways never envisioned by Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;For the past decade, significant flaws in the MMPA have 
enabled special interest groups to drive an anti-oil and gas 
agenda through the courts and bureaucracies with no benefit to 
marine life. Fixing these flaws would increase regulatory 
certainty, decrease inefficiencies, and benefit all 
stakeholders and implementing agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;The prime example is the Atlantic, where obtaining a permit 
to conduct a seismic survey has been excessively laborious, and 
riddled with uncertainty and unlawful delay. Initial requests 
for survey permits were made 7 years ago, with the permits 
under current consideration pending for the past 3. The 
permitting of potential Atlantic surveys has included many 
environmental impact reviews, and multiple opportunities for 
public comment, including unprecedented comment periods not 
required by statute.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;However, the most concerning and problematic delays are 
primarily due to difficulties acquiring incidental take 
authorizations, or IHAs, from NMFS, pursuant to the MMPA. 
Delays to pending IHA applications now stand in excess of 700 
days. In my written testimony, I have provided detailed 
recommendations on how Congress should amend the MMPA to bring 
the law into the 21st century. These include updates to areas 
of the statute that are ambiguous and unsuited for practical 
application to offshore activities, and also recommendations to 
address the inexcusable delays and procedural inefficiencies 
that have occurred in the past decade.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;Congressman Johnson's Streamlining Environmental Approvals 
Act is the first step to correct the course on a wayward law. 
The SEA Act provides a common-sense approach to ensure that 
offshore energy exploration and other critical activities can 
move forward, in line with the original intent of the MMPA. By 
setting reasonable deadlines in the application process, 
Congress can hold agencies accountable to existing statutory 
timelines and prevent future misapplication of the statute.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;The Act also recognizes the MMPA as the highest standard 
for marine mammal conservation, and ensures that other 
environmental review processes that provide no additional 
benefit or higher threshold of review can be used to stall the 
permitting of activities that pose no threat to marine life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;We urge Congress to repair the MMPA, reasserting the law to 
protect marine mammals from real threats, as identified by the 
best-available science, not phantom impacts imagined by anti-
oil and gas groups, and pass the SEA Act, along with yet-
introduced legislation to modernize the statute.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;On behalf of the IAGC, I appreciate the opportunity to voice to the 
modernizing the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The IAGC is the international trade association representing all 
segments of the geophysical industry, essential to discovering and 
delivering the world's energy resources. The IAGC member companies play 
an integral role in the successful exploration and development of 
hydrocarbon resources, onshore and offshore, through the acquisition 
and processing of geophysical data. For more than 45 years, IAGC has 
been the global voice of the geophysical industry and is the only trade 
organization solely dedicated to the industry. The IAGC represents more 
than 110-member companies from all segments of the geophysical 
industry. Our members help to shape industry priorities and positions 
through IAGC chapters, committees and workgroups.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Seismic and other geophysical surveys have been safely conducted in 
the United States and around the world for over 50 years. These 
geophysical surveys are the critical first step to better understanding 
the resource base of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and providing 
policy makers and regulators with the information they need to make 
informed decisions about oil and gas development based on the best 
available data. Surveys do not necessarily lead to oil and gas 
development. In fact, surveys determine both areas that are and are not 
likely to have recoverable oil and gas resources. However, unless the 
surveys can commence, that information will never be available to 
policy makers and the public. It is important to point out that seismic 
and other geophysical survey activities are temporary and transitory; 
they are the least intrusive way to explore the earth's geology and its 
dynamic processes which impact human lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The use of modern seismic technology is similar to ultrasound 
technology which is commonly used in the medical profession for imaging 
the human body. Today's advancements in seismic technology, which can 
pinpoint the most fruitful areas for hydrocarbon potential, have 
contributed to reducing the overall environmental footprint associated 
with oil and gas exploration. Seismic technology has also helped to 
decrease operational and safety risks associated with oil and gas 
development.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Seismic surveying is a well understood and safe industry practice, 
and informed policy decisions regarding offshore energy development can 
only be made with the evaluation provided by modern seismic survey 
technology. And it is for this very reason that environmental advocacy 
groups have actively worked to politicize the seismic survey permitting 
process, under the pretense of alleged harm to marine mammals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;As the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the National 
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have continually stated time and time 
again--throughout changing political administrations--to date, there 
has been no documented scientific evidence of noise from acoustic 
sources used in seismic activities adversely affecting marine animal 
populations or coastal communities.\1\ They note that this technology 
has been used for decades around the world, including in U.S. waters 
off of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska with no known detrimental impact 
to marine animal populations or to commercial fishing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;\1\ BOEM stated in its August 22, 2014 Science Note.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Indeed, more than five decades of worldwide seismic surveying and 
scientific research demonstrate that the risk of direct physical injury 
to marine mammals is extremely low, and there is no scientific evidence 
demonstrating biologically significant negative impacts on marine life 
populations. Because survey activities are temporary and transitory, 
they are the least intrusive way to explore the earth's geology.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;As an example, of the usefulness of geophysical data, the BOEM 
recently announced the public release of a 1.4-billion-pixel map that 
will help scientists from academia, environmental agencies, and 
governmental agencies further understand the prolific Gulf of Mexico 
region. This once-impossible feat was created by using more than 200 
individual maps from geophysical companies, all of which are IAGC 
members. The maps cover 135,000 square miles of the Gulf of Mexico with 
datasets spanning more than 30 years. In the more than 50 years of 
seismic surveying in the Gulf of Mexico, there has not been a single 
reported incidence of sound from seismic operations injuring marine 
life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The seismic industry is committed to conducting its operations in 
an environmentally responsible manner, and utilizes mitigation 
measures, such as exclusion zones, soft-starts, and protected species 
observers to further reduce any possibility of potential impacts to 
marine life. The industry supports a process of developing and 
implementing effective mitigation measures that are proportionate to 
the level of potential risk and specific to the local population of 
marine animals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The reality is the seismic industry has a long track record of 
safe, responsible operations around the world. Unfortunately, the 
permitting of this activity critical to identifying the Nation's energy 
supplies is too often stalled or impeded by extreme environmental 
advocacy organizations exploiting existing regulatory and litigation 
processes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In my capacity as President of the IAGC, I have experienced 
firsthand the detrimental impacts of non-transparent and delayed 
decision making on the geophysical industry stemming from an outdated 
law, the MMPA, which is currently being administered by agencies and 
exploited by advocacy groups in ways that were never envisioned by 
Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;mmpa background&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;When it was enacted in 1972 (and subsequently amended), the 
congressional intent behind the MMPA was cutting edge and forward-
thinking. The MMPA was intended to address significant declines in some 
species of marine mammals caused by human activities such as 
overhunting, overfishing and unscrupulous trade. It was not originally 
designed to regulate sound in a marine ecosystem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The MMPA established a prohibition on the ``taking'' of marine 
mammals in U.S. waters, unless the take is authorized by the designated 
U.S. regulatory authorities, the NMFS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service (FWS). Congress defined ``take'' in the MMPA as ``to harass, 
hunt, capture or kill'' a marine mammal, or the attempt to do so. 
``Harassment'' is defined as ``any act of pursuit, torment, or 
annoyance'' that either:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;A.   ``has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;mammal stock in the wild'' (referred to as a Level A&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;harassment); or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;B.   ``has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering'' (referred to as a&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Level B harassment).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Under the MMPA, NMFS and FWS administer a system of permitting 
authorities that allows for take in certain situations, such as for 
commercial fishing permits, scientific research permits, educational 
activities (e.g., science centers and aquaria) and subsistence hunting 
in Alaska. For many years, NMFS and FWS have authorized the incidental, 
but not intentional, taking of marine mammals for activities related to 
offshore seismic and offshore energy and minerals exploration. This is 
done through issuance of Incidental Take Regulations (ITRs), which are 
effective for a period up to 5 years, and through Incidental Harassment 
Authorizations (IHAs), which are effective for a period of no more than 
1 year. The best available science and information demonstrate that, 
whether individually or cumulatively, these authorizations have 
resulted in no detectable adverse impacts to marine mammal populations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Current NMFS policy measures whether sound from a proposed 
activity, such as seismic surveying, has the potential to injure (Level 
A harassment) or has the potential to disrupt a behavioral pattern 
(Level B harassment) using agency guidance setting forth defined 
threshold decibel levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;There are no verified injuries or deaths of marine mammals from 
exposure to seismic survey arrays. NMFS itself recognizes that ``[t]o 
date, there is no evidence that serious injury, death or stranding by 
marine mammals can occur from exposure'' to seismic air source arrays, 
even in the case of large arrays. In marked contrast, the greatest 
source of marine mammal takes today come from fisheries bycatch, and 
these take counts are based on direct observation of marine mammals 
killed or seriously injured during fishing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;While there will always be exceptions, such as the loss of the 
Chinese baiji river dolphin and the current peril of the vaquita in 
Mexico, both victims of illegal destructive fishing practices, the 
history of marine mammals since the MMPA was enacted has been a long 
list of successes: the recovery of California sea lions, Guadalupe fur 
seals and elephant seals from near-extinction, the de-listing of gray 
whales and humpback whales since the cessation of whaling, the end of 
massive losses of pelagic dolphins in the tuna purse seine fishery--and 
more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Even the story of the North Atlantic Right Whale is largely one of 
success, as the species has continued to slowly recover from near 
extinction. While seismic surveys off the U.S. Atlantic coast have not 
been as common as at other sites where other right whale species have 
bounced back from whaling in more dramatic fashion, it still must be 
noted that the whales at those other sites made their dramatic 
recoveries in the presence of frequent and ongoing seismic surveys 
(South Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand). And despite the 
relative infrequency of seismic surveys on our Atlantic coast in recent 
decades, the North Atlantic species is certainly no stranger to seismic 
surveys during their movements between the U.S. Atlantic coast, Canada, 
and even as far as the North Sea where seismic survey activity has been 
common for decades.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;All of this post-MMPA good news has taken place in a context of 
continuous use of seismic surveys around the world. Populations that 
were considered robust prior to the MMPA remain robust and species 
removed from commercial exploitation or high levels of fishery bycatch 
have bounced back as fast or faster than expected even as seismic 
survey activity went on all around them without any apparent difference 
from locations without seismic survey activity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;However, decades of regulation and litigation have exposed some 
significant flaws in the MMPA. Fixing these flaws would increase 
regulatory certainty, decrease inefficiencies, and ultimately benefit 
all stakeholders and implementing agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The primary flaws stem from poorly written statutory language that 
creates (1) ambiguity and uncertainty in the application of the MMPA's 
legal standards, and (2) procedural inefficiency. Fixing some of the 
most obvious flaws in the MMPA could result in tangible regulatory 
benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The following addresses some of the key problematic areas, as well 
as potential solutions. Following the examples set forth below on the 
practical impacts to the geophysical industry, I will provide detailed 
recommendations on how the MMPA should be amended to bring the law into 
the 21st century. It is time to bring the MMPA back in line with its 
original intent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;atlantic ocs&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Approximately 30 years have passed since seismic surveys assessed 
the potential hydrocarbon resource base of the U.S. Atlantic OCS. 
However, seismic surveys for `scientific research' have been conducted 
fairly regularly in the Atlantic OCS, in addition to other geophysical 
surveys used to characterize the seabed and subsurface for suitability 
of offshore wind energy facilities. One recent `scientific research' 
survey collected data along 3,000 miles of trackline in the area of the 
Outer Banks, of North Carolina, between September and October 2014. 
This survey used the same technology that is used for oil and gas 
exploration. Another recent research seismic survey to record sea level 
change and its impact on the coastline was completed in July 2015 off 
the New Jersey coast.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Currently, six IAGC member companies are pursuing issuance of 
permits to conduct seismic surveying in the Atlantic OCS, a process 
that started 7 years ago when the first permit application was filed, 
with then-Minerals Management Service. These proposed surveys are 
essential to the potential ``expeditious and orderly development'' of 
the OCS, as mandated by Congress in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands 
Act (OCSLA).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;After extensive environmental review at the programmatic level, the 
BOEM published a Record of Decision in July 2014, authorizing 
consideration of permits for geophysical surveys. Since then, pending 
permit applications have been subjected to a regulatory process plagued 
with continued delays and uncertainty. This inexplicable and 
inexcusable process was capped by the previous administration's abrupt 
political decision, on the eve of a new presidency, to summarily deny 
all permit applications. BOEM has since correctly reinstated the permit 
applications, which remain under agency review.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Needless to say, obtaining a permit to conduct a seismic survey in 
the Atlantic has been an extensive process that includes many 
environmental impact analyses, multiple opportunities for public 
comment and review, including additional and unprecedented public 
comment periods that are not required by statute or regulation, and 
reviews by bordering states. However, the most concerning and 
problematic delays beginning in July 2014 are primarily due to 
difficulties acquiring IHAs from NMFS for the incidental take of marine 
mammals pursuant to the MMPA. BOEM has indicated that they will not 
issue decisions on pending seismic survey permits until NMFS has also 
authorized IHAs for the proposed activities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;As part of the permitting process to move forward with data 
acquisition on the Atlantic OCS our members have applied for coverage, 
in the form of IHAs issued pursuant to the MMPA, for any incidental 
harassment of marine mammals. The MMPA establishes clear deadlines for 
the processing of IHA applications. MMPA Section 101(a)(5)(D) states 
that the ``Secretary shall publish a proposed authorization not later 
than 45 days after receiving an [IHA] application'' and request public 
comment. 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1371(a)(5)(D)(iii) (emphasis added). After 
holding a 30-day comment period, the Secretary ``shall issue'' the IHA 
within 45 days of the close of the comment period, so long as the 
required MMPA findings are made. Id. These deadlines are particularly 
important because IHAs are issued for a period of only 1 year and 
planning for offshore surveys is complicated and very time-sensitive. 
Here, the IHA applications were submitted in 2014 (with some of them 
updated in the summer of 2015), and the first 45-day statutory deadline 
has already been surpassed by a substantial period of time. NMFS's own 
website acknowledges that following an adequacy and completeness review 
of 2 to 6 weeks, a full application process should last 6 to 9 months. 
Some of our members have now waited nearly 2 years for IHAs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;To further illustrate the inconsistencies present in the BOEM 
permit and NMFS IHA processes for the Atlantic, BOEM provided an 
unprecedented 45- and 60-day public comment period on pending 
geophysical permit applications and NMFS added an unprecedented 30-day 
comment period on IHA applications. To our knowledge, neither comment 
period has ever been required for a permitting process or IHA process 
before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Many reasons have been speculated for the delays to issuing 
decisions on pending IHA applications, which now stand in excess of 700 
days in some cases. According to NMFS, one such delay in issuing IHAs 
was due to an unpublished study from Duke University that was 
unavailable to the public while the agency stalled its review of IHA 
applications to consider it at the request of certain environmental 
advocacy organizations.\2\ These organizations have a well-established 
history of using the regulatory and litigation processes as means to 
impede and ultimately attempt to prevent any activities from occurring 
because they are fundamentally opposed to all offshore oil and gas 
activities.

Geophysical Applications--December 9, 2015.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Additional delays were attributed to uncertainty over application 
of a series of drafts and final guidance addressing acoustic threshold 
levels for permanent and temporary auditory threshold shifts in marine 
mammals (Acoustic Guidance).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Much has been made by environmental groups and the media of the 
estimate for as many as 138,000 Level A (potentially injurious) 
``takes'' in the BOEM's programmatic environmental impact statement 
(PEIS) addressing the potential effects of seismic activities in the 
Atlantic Ocean. Using a more realistic risk criterion based on the 
above peer-reviewed research, and taking into account standard 
monitoring and mitigation practices employed by the seismic industry, 
the more likely estimate of potential Level A takes is zero or a 
comparably small single digit number; again, consistent with past 
experience in the Gulf of Mexico and other locations globally. In fact, 
with successful mitigation the government acknowledges that all 
estimates of injury would be avoided.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;After completing a set of new acoustic guidelines in July 2015, 
complete with external expert review and an extended public comment 
period, NMFS again failed to implement new guidelines. Then 
unexpectedly on March 16, 2016, NMFS released a third draft of proposed 
revised acoustic guidelines. The third draft did not receive external 
expert peer review before it was sent to the public and NMFS provided 
for only a 14-day public comment period while inexplicably denying all 
reasonable extension requests. Within the short time period allowed for 
review, the experts within the seismic industry concluded that there 
are egregious errors in how NMFS calculated sound impacts on marine 
mammals. In an apparent attempt to appease special interest groups 
inside and outside the agency, NMFS created a biologically unrealistic 
`precautionary' large whale hearing function and selectively removed 
data from the large whale and seal hearing literature to better support 
a modified hearing curve that specifically targeted low frequency sound 
sources like seismic survey sounds. The guidance was finalized in the 
fall of 2016 with only minor changes and included a `short-cut' work-
around purposefully designed to be overly cautious.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;IAGC applauded inclusion of the acoustic guidelines in the 
President's Executive Order earlier this year and will work closely 
with the new Administration to ensure the guidance is amended to 
reflect the best and accurate scientific information. Currently, 
however, NMFS is using the flawed acoustic guidance to (over)estimate 
the amount of takes that may be authorized by the Atlantic IHAs. NMFS's 
inability to issue new acoustic guidance on a timely or straightforward 
basis as resulted in substantial additional delay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Excessive delays, in violation of statute, should not continue and 
we appreciate this Committee's oversight in ensuring Federal agencies 
are making transparent decisions, relying on the best publicly 
available science in a manner that is faithful to Federal law and 
policy, which mandates the ``expeditious and orderly'' development of 
the OCS ``subject to environmental safeguards.'' Approximately 80 
percent of the Mid- and South Atlantic Planning areas that was 
originally included in the draft 2017-2022 Five-Year Plan for 
consideration of exploration leases, has never been evaluated with 
seismic surveys. Based only on the small portion of the Atlantic OCS 
that has previously been surveyed, the BOEM estimates 4.72 billion 
barrels of recoverable oil and 37.5 trillion cubic feet of recoverable 
natural gas are available. With the ability to survey the Atlantic OCS 
with more modern technology, it is likely these estimates will 
significantly increase.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Further delay from the agencies is unacceptable and has no support 
in the plain language of the MMPA or the mandate of OCSLA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;gulf of mexico ocs&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In 2016, BOEM--on behalf of oil and gas and geophysical 
industries--submitted to NMFS a revised Application for ITRs for 
geophysical survey activity in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Pursuant to 
the MMPA, the ITRs would establish a framework for authorization of 
incidental take of marine mammals over the course of 5 years. NMFS 
accepted public comments on the application in early 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The GOM OCS is a significant source of oil and gas for the Nation's 
energy supply. In 2014, the GOM OCS region was responsible for 16 
percent of the total U.S. crude oil production and 5 percent of dry 
natural gas production. Likewise, GOM OCS leases are an important 
source of Federal revenues, generating substantial bonuses, rentals, 
and royalties paid to the United States. Since 2008, lessees have paid 
over $11 billion in bonus bids for lease sales in the GOM OCS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Total oil and gas royalty revenues from the GOM OCS amounted to 
almost $5 billion in Fiscal Year 2015 alone. Moreover, BOEM has 
recently estimated the net economic value of future GOM leasing to be 
as high as $197 billion. Geological and geophysical survey activities 
are crucial to the discovery, development, and valuation of OCS 
resources that lead to such production. This technology has been used 
for more than 50 years around the world. It is still used in U.S. 
waters in the GOM with no known detrimental impact to marine animal 
populations or to commercial fishing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Industry members are committed to environmental protection and 
ensuring that geophysical activities in the Gulf of Mexico are carried 
out in a responsible manner. Industry's long-standing and ongoing 
research into these issues reflects those interests. We do not, 
however, support ineffective, unproductive, or unreasonable 
requirements.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;arctic ocs&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The oil and gas industry has routinely applied for and successfully 
received incidental take authorizations pursuant to the MMPA covering 
geophysical and other exploration activities in the Arctic OCS, by NMFS 
and the FWS on a project-by-project basis (i.e., incidental harassment 
authorizations) or through the issuance of ITRs and related letters of 
authorization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In the past decade, almost every MMPA ITR issued for Arctic oil and 
gas activities has been challenged by environmental advocacy 
organizations, and in every instance and on all counts, the 
authorizations have been upheld by the courts. Specifically, various 
advocacy organizations challenged the U.S. Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service's 
2006 Beaufort Sea ITRs, 2008 Chukchi Sea ITRs, and 2013 Chukchi Sea 
ITRs. These lawsuits were litigated in the Alaska Federal District 
Court and each lawsuit was appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals. The plaintiffs asserted claims under the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA) alleging violations of the MMPA and other Federal 
environmental statutes. The most recent lawsuit challenging the 2013 
Chukchi ITR was an expressly admitted attempt by advocacy organizations 
to block Shell's Chukchi Sea exploration program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In all three cases, neither the Alaska District Court nor the Ninth 
Circuit found merit in any of the claims raised by the advocacy groups. 
The track record of MMPA ITR litigation in the Arctic strongly supports 
the notion that advocacy groups have leveraged their ability to 
challenge MMPA ITRs via the APA as a means to attempt to block or 
impede oil and gas operations. However, although these lawsuits have 
cost the courts, agencies, and applicants substantial time and money, 
they have accomplished no meaningful result (other than delay, as 
intended by the advocacy groups) because, as the courts expressly held 
on all counts, none of the claims raised had any merit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The past and existing approach to implementing the MMPA in the 
Arctic has been relatively efficient, thorough, effective, and approved 
by the courts. Yet, advocacy organizations have continued to misuse the 
APA's litigation provisions to attempt--unsuccessfully--to impede 
Arctic oil and gas activities. The misguided intentions of these 
organizations have not only failed in court, but the allegations upon 
which they are supposedly based have not borne out in the scientific 
record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;After decades of oil and gas exploration activities in the Arctic, 
there is no information demonstrating that any of the activities have 
had anything more than a negligible impact on marine mammal. This 
finding has been repeatedly made by Federal agency scientists in 
numerous public documents. In fact, as just one example, the iconic 
Arctic bowhead whale has dramatically increased in abundance during 
this same period of time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;specific recommendations for modernizing the mmpa&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The following recommendations focus on the areas of the MMPA that 
are ambiguous and unsuited for practical application to offshore 
activities, and have been misapplied by agencies in the regulatory 
process and exploited by environmental advocacy organizations in 
litigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;To issue an incidental take authorization under Section 101(a)(5) 
of the MMPA, the agency must show that the authorization will have no 
more than a negligible impact on marine mammal populations and result 
in only small numbers of incidentally taken animals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Problems: (1) ``Negligible impact'' is not clearly&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;defined; (2) ``small numbers'' is not defined at all; and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;(3) there is significant overlap between these two&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;ambiguous standards. These problems have led to regulatory&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;uncertainty, inconsistent application by agencies, and much&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;litigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Solution: Create a redefined unambiguous ``negligible&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;impact'' standard, and eliminate the ``small numbers''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;requirement. A single, clear standard for authorizations&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;would result in regulatory efficiency and predictability.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;To issue an incidental take authorization, the agency must require 
``other means of effecting the least practicable impact.'' These 
``other means'' typically take the form of mitigation measures included 
as conditions of the authorization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Problem: ``Least practicable impact'' is not defined in&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;the statute or in the implementing regulations. As a&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;result, it is not consistently applied by agencies, there&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;is very little guidance for the regulated community, and,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;most recently, the phrase has been unreasonably interpreted&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Solution: Create a new, clear definition for ``least&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;practicable impact.'' The definition should state that&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;operational concerns and economic feasibility are primary&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;factors in determining what mitigation is ``practicable.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The MMPA permits the authorization of incidental take by 
harassment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Problem: The definition of ``harassment'' is overly broad&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;and ambiguous, and confusingly refers to ``potential''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;harassment rather than actual harassment. This results in&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;serious problems in the estimation of incidental take and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;unrealistic assumptions made by the implementing agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Solution: Redefine ``harassment'' to remove the word&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;``potential'' and to establish a more specific standard&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;that provides better clarity for the agencies and the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;regulated community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;procedural recommendations for implementing the mmpa&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The following recommendations are specifically intended to address 
the inexcusable delays and other regulatory implementation problems 
that have occurred in the past decade. These recommendations are 
intended to make the regulatory process more efficient and predictable 
for both the implementation agencies and the regulated community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The process for issuing incidental take authorizations is routinely 
delayed by the implementing agencies. The current procedural 
requirements create little accountability for agencies because they are 
either ambiguous or establish no consequences or solutions for 
unreasonably delayed agency action.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Solution #1: Revise the procedural requirements to set&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;clear and firm deadlines for each stage of the permitting&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;process, and establish consequences for when agency&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;deadlines are not met (e.g., default approvals).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Solution #2: Create a streamlined authorization process&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;for certain low-effect, but common, activities (similar to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;the nationwide permit process under the Clean Water Act).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The MMPA creates a 5-year limit on ``incidental take regulations'' 
that requires applicants to petition for a new set of regulations every 
5 years. This results in unnecessary and burdensome administrative 
processes that create frequent opportunities for litigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Solution: Remove the 5-year limit or, alternatively,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;create a simple and straightforward 5-year renewal process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Issues involving the overlap of the MMPA, the Endangered Species 
Act (ESA), and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) have proven 
difficult for the agencies, the courts, and the regulated community. 
Because the MMPA sets the most rigorous conservation-oriented standards 
of all these statutes, additional reviews and administrative processes 
under the ESA and NEPA are often unnecessary and redundant.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Solution: Make statutory revisions to minimize or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;eliminate the need for duplicative ESA and NEPA review&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;processes for certain MMPA authorizations. This would&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;substantially increase regulatory efficiency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;streamlining environmental approvals act of 2017&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In an effort to begin to bring certainty and clarity to the MMPA 
and solve some of the problems outlined in my testimony above, 
Representative Johnson (LA) has introduced, the Streamlining 
Environmental Approvals Act of 2017, or the SEA Act. By reducing 
burdensome geophysical authorizations, the SEA Act will ensure improved 
access to and expanded production of domestic energy supplies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Similar to many other laws, the MMPA has been expanded and 
interpreted beyond what the law was intended to regulate. After decades 
of regulation and litigation, the law as applied is significantly 
different than what was originally intended by Congress. This current, 
overly burdensome and duplicative process impacts numerous business and 
communities. For years, the U.S. Navy has experienced substantial 
delays and added costs in acquiring permits to conduct sonar activity 
in U.S. oceans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The bill would set clear and firm deadlines for each stage of the 
authorizing process by establishing a consequence for default approvals 
when deadlines are not met. Because IHAs expire after 1 year, project 
proponents must re-apply over multiple years, even if there is little 
or no change in the best available science or the marine mammal 
population. The SEA Act will allow IHAs to be renewed without lengthy 
and needless agency review so long as there have been no significant 
changes to the underlying activity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Additionally, the bill removes duplicative Federal agency processes 
between the MMPA and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to increase 
regulatory efficiency. Because the MMPA sets the most rigorous, 
conservation-oriented standards of the two statutes, additional review 
and administrative processes under the ESA are unnecessary, redundant, 
and add no additional protections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Specific Provisions of the SEA Act:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Technical changes are made through striking and adding new&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;legislative language.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Secretary has 45 days to accept or deny the request&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;for a permit. The Secretary also has the option to request&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;additional information to complete the request, but may not&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;make a second request for information. If the Secretary&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;does not respond within 45 days, the request will be&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;considered complete by default. Following the completeness&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;determination period, a 30-day public comment period will&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;be provided.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Allows the option to extend an IHA for more than a year if&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;there has been no substantial change to the marine mammal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;population. The holder may request this extension up to 90&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;days before the expiration of the permit and the Secretary&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;has 14 days to respond.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Secretary has 120 days total after an initial&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;application to issue the authorization allowing for&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;activity to begin. Should the deadline not be met, the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;authorization will be deemed approved on the terms stated&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;in the application.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Marine mammals that are also listed as endangered or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;threatened under the ESA are regulated under both the MMPA&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;and ESA. The final section would exempt marine mammals from&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;the ESA's section 9 take prohibition and section 7 Federal&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;consultation requirement since any ``take'' would be&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;regulated by more stringent requirements of the MMPA. This&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;will greatly reduce duplicative actions by Federal agencies&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;with no negative impacts individual marine mammals or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;marine mammal species.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;conclusion&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;After more than 50 years of continuous seismic survey sound in many 
places around the world, including the Gulf of Mexico, and after a 
decade of intense scientific and environmental advocacy group scrutiny, 
there is still no scientific support for statements that seismic sound 
kills or injures marine mammals, causes them to beach themselves, or 
disrupts their behavior to the extent that it affects the health and 
well-being of the individuals or the populations of which those 
individuals are a part. This, however, does not mean that our industry 
plans to discontinue our active search for any and all potentially 
undetected risks through our support of independent, third-party 
research, nor does it mean that we will reduce our diligence in 
monitoring, mitigation and documentation of our activities and their 
potential environmental effects.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The preponderance of evidence against the possibility of 
environmental effects from our activities does, however, mean that 
irresponsible and unsupported speculations of what ``could, might, or 
may'' potentially occur will be subjected to the same high standards of 
scientific verification and validation that would be expected of our 
own industry-funded research.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;As BOEM stated in its August 22, 2014 Science Note, ``To date, 
there has been no documented scientific evidence of noise from air guns 
used in geological and geophysical (G&amp;amp;G) seismic activities adversely 
affecting marine animal populations or coastal communities. This 
technology has been used for more than 30 years around the world. It is 
still used in U.S. waters off of the Gulf of Mexico with no known 
detrimental impact to marine animal populations or to commercial 
fishing.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;IAGC finds it unacceptable for seismic permit applicants to have to 
wait over 2 years for issuance of a simple IHA when all the requisite 
environmental analysis, based on the best available science, has long 
since been completed. We ask this Committee to urge NMFS to adhere to 
required timelines set forth in the MMPA. Further, we urge the Full 
Committee on Natural Resources to support and pass legislation to 
modernize the MMPA, including passage of the SEA Act without delay. The 
development of regulatory mechanisms for the Atlantic OCS and the Gulf 
of Mexico by the Department of the Interior and related agencies such 
as NMFS has become a regulatory abyss in which the necessary and 
sufficient conditions for obtaining a permit are obscure and constantly 
changing without sufficient notice or adequate review. The lack of 
transparency and reliance upon scientifically questionable regulation 
and policy cannot continue if the United States intends to chart a 
sustainable energy future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;According to a recent report \3\ from the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration, within the Department of Energy, global energy will 
grow by 48 percent by 2040. Many experts have explained that even the 
most ambitious schedule of renewable energy development will still 
require substantial supplies of oil and gas for at least the next 30-40 
years, if not longer.

Outlook 2016.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;We urge Congress to review the MMPA and pass meaningful reform, 
including the SEA Act, that will rectify the existing limbo for pending 
seismic survey IHA applications. Streamlining the permitting process 
along with reducing the ability for outside special interest groups to 
obstruct energy exploration is a necessary first step to ensure our 
continued development for future generations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Questions Submitted by Rep. Johnson&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Question 1. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, anyone wishing 
to conduct operations that have the potential to result in harm to 
marine mammals must obtain a permit to authorize incidental take. In 
your testimony, you characterize the process for obtaining these 
permits as an extremely long and complicated process, one that has 
taken years for some companies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;1a. What accounts for these delays?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer. There are multiple reasons for delays in the permitting of 
seismic surveys offshore, but the most concerning and problematic 
delays are due to difficulties obtaining MMPA incidental take 
authorizations from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). When 
the MMPA was enacted, it was never intended to regulate anthropogenic 
sound, nor was it intended to require NMFS to regulate exploration and 
development of our Nation's oil and gas resources. Recent primary 
delays in the permitting of proposed geophysical surveys for the 
Atlantic OCS stem from NMFS' inability to process Incidental Harassment 
Authorizations (IHAs) and implement Incidental Take Rulemakings (ITRs) 
in a reasonable, timely fashion--to a large extent because of vague and 
ill-defined terms used in the MMPA, and lack of an enforceable 
timeline. The necessary and sufficient conditions for obtaining an MMPA 
authorization from NMFS are obscure and constantly changing without 
sufficient notice or adequate review. These flaws are explained in more 
detail under the next question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;One area that seems increasingly difficult for NMFS (and 
applicants) to analyze is estimation of `Level A harassment' of marine 
mammals--defined as something that ``has the potential to injure a 
marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild'' and `Level B 
harassment' of marine mammals--defined as something that ``has the 
potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild 
by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not 
limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or 
sheltering'' (emphasis added).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;For many years, NMFS has worked to provide technical guidance for 
assessing the effects of anthropogenic sound on marine mammal hearing 
(NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-OPR-55) by providing acoustic sound 
thresholds for Level A harassment--and revisions continue to this day. 
Many delays in the Atlantic IHA review process were attributed to 
uncertainty over application of a series of draft versions of this 
technical acoustic guidance, even though a 2016 National Academy of 
Sciences Panel recently reconfirmed that ``no scientific studies have 
conclusively demonstrated a link between exposure to sound and adverse 
effects on a marine mammal population.'' Implementing the final 
guidance published in 2016 requires extensive modeling and analysis for 
any given proposed activity, and arguably only a few sophisticated 
companies in the world are capable of such a task. Further, NMFS will 
be attempting to enact guidance on Level B harassment, something even 
more difficult than measuring the potential for injury, or Level A 
harassment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Emblematic of a process that has been riddled with excessive 
uncertainties, NMFS also stalled its review of Atlantic IHAs to 
consider whether applicants should revise their submissions to include 
an unpublished study from Duke University at the behest of certain 
environmental advocacy organizations. NMFS requested applicants amend 
their IHA applications to incorporate the study's hypothetical model 
forecasts of marine mammal distribution under threat of further delays 
in IHA, and subsequently permit, issuance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Delays and excessive paperwork (by NMFS and applicants) for 
carrying out seismic surveys, an activity never proven to harm marine 
mammals, should not be subject to laborious modeling and evaluation 
simply due to broad and vague terms surrounding `harassment' and the 
agency's inability to follow statutory timelines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;1b. In your opinion, what steps can Congress or agencies take to 
clear up these unnecessary delays in permitting while continuing to 
ensure proper protections for marine mammals?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer. In the 35 years since passage of the MMPA, many advances in 
technology and increased human activities offshore have developed, 
including activities never contemplated by Congress. Additionally, 
special interest groups opposed to certain activities have used the 
regulatory and legal systems to exploit ambiguities in the law in order 
to slow and block those actions they oppose such as exploration and 
develop of offshore oil and gas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Decades of regulation and litigation have exposed some significant 
flaws in the MMPA. Fixing these flaws would increase regulatory 
efficiency, decrease uncertainty, and ultimately benefit all 
stakeholders and the implementing agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The primary flaws stem from poorly written statutory language that 
creates (1) ambiguity and uncertainty in the application of the MMPA's 
legal standards, and (2) procedural inefficiency. Fixing some of the 
most obvious flaws in the MMPA could result in tangible regulatory 
benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Congress can take steps to modernize the MMPA, bringing it back to 
its original intent to truly and effectively protect marine mammal 
populations. Specifically, streamlining the process for obtaining IHAs 
or implementing ITRs. Further, terms used in the MMPA should be defined 
more clearly so that the legal system is not left to make assumptions 
on the meaning Congress intended. Some examples include, `Level B 
Take', `small numbers', `negligible impact', `harassment' and `least 
practicable impact'. Please see page 9 of my written testimony for 
detailed recommendations on how Congress can modernize the MMPA. We 
stand ready to assist you and your colleagues in Congress in bringing 
the MMPA back in line with its original intent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The agencies can and should also implement regulations and guidance 
that provide more certainty for offshore activities, specifically 
focusing on those areas that can meaningfully protect marine mammals 
from threats identified by the best available science, and not 
speculative impacts unproven by tangible, replicable, scientific 
evidence. Preventing an offshore activity like seismic surveying with 
no demonstrated adverse impact will have no beneficial effect to marine 
mammal populations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Question 2. I recently introduced a bill, the SEA Act (H.R. 3133), 
to help correct some of the concerns you express in your testimony and 
I want to thank you for supporting this effort. As you know, my bill 
will clarify the permitting process, reducing ambiguity and creating 
certainty in the application of the MMPA's legal standards and 
procedural inefficiency. The SEA Act will provide a much-needed common-
sense approach to ensure that critical exploration and military 
operations can move forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;2a. Do you agree that the SEA Act will bring the MMPA back in line 
with the original intent of Congress?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer. Thank you for your leadership in recognizing the need to 
update and modernize the MMPA to better fit the 21st century. I agree, 
the SEA Act will take necessary steps to begin to bring the MMPA back 
in line with the original intent of Congress in protecting marine 
mammal populations. By streamlining the process for obtaining IHAs for 
activities that have little to no impact on marine mammals, the SEA Act 
will ensure agencies and commercial interests are not needlessly 
spending resources on approval of actions with no corresponding 
environmental benefits. Further, the SEA Act begins to redefine 
ambiguous terms and remove duplicative processes among agencies. 
Section 3 of the SEA Act, removes redundancy between NMFS and the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service by recognizing there is no need for two 
Federal agencies to complete reviews and approvals of offshore 
activities where no impacts have been found.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;2b. Would you agree that H.R. 3133 will ensure the permitting 
decisions made by FWS and NMFS will [be] based on proven science as 
opposed to being dictated by political whims?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer. IAGC fully supports Federal decisions being based on the 
best available science and advocates for open and transparent decision-
making processes. This, however, does not mean that decisions should be 
delayed when an agency is waiting for scientific research or specific 
research that does not exist. The SEA Act will require NMFS (and FWS) 
to make decisions on a strict timeline in adherence with the original 
intent of the MMPA, removing any ambiguity over how long Federal 
agencies can `sit' on applications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;To reiterate, more than five decades of worldwide seismic surveying 
and scientific research indicate that the risk of injury to marine 
mammals is extremely low, and currently there is no scientific evidence 
demonstrating biologically significant negative impacts on marine life 
populations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;As BOEM stated in its August 22, 2014 Science Note, ``To date, 
there has been no documented scientific evidence of noise from air guns 
used in geological and geophysical (G&amp;amp;G) seismic activities adversely 
affecting marine animal populations or coastal communities. This 
technology has been used for more than 30 years around the world. It is 
still used in U.S. waters off of the Gulf of Mexico with no known 
detrimental impact to marine animal populations or to commercial 
fishing.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Question 3. Your testimony mentions the role that advocacy groups 
play in causing delays to the regulatory process under the MMPA through 
litigation. The U.S. Navy has been unnecessarily and regularly 
obstructed by legal actions from these groups as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;3a. Would you say these practices are common during the permitting 
process for most seismic surveyors?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer. While the industry has routinely applied for and 
successfully received incidental take authorizations pursuant to the 
MMPA covering geophysical and other exploration activities in the 
Arctic OCS, by NMFS and the FWS on a project-by-project basis (i.e., 
incidental harassment authorizations) or through the issuance of ITRs 
and related letters of authorization, almost every MMPA ITR issued for 
Arctic oil and gas activities has been challenged by environmental 
advocacy organizations. Specifically, various advocacy organizations 
challenged the U.S. Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service's 2006 Beaufort Sea ITRs, 
2008 Chukchi Sea ITRs, and 2013 Chukchi Sea ITRs. These lawsuits were 
litigated in the Alaska Federal District Court and each lawsuit was 
appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The plaintiffs asserted 
claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) alleging violations 
of the MMPA and other Federal environmental statutes. The most recent 
lawsuit challenging the 2013 Chukchi ITR was an expressly admitted 
attempt by advocacy organizations to block Shell's Chukchi Sea 
exploration program. In every instance and on all counts, the 
authorizations have been upheld by the courts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In all three cases, neither the Alaska District Court nor the Ninth 
Circuit found merit in any of the claims raised by the advocacy groups.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;3b. What effect does this constant litigation have on the 
regulatory process and overall offshore energy development?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer. The track record of MMPA ITR litigation in the Arctic 
strongly supports the notion that advocacy groups have leveraged their 
ability to challenge MMPA ITRs via the APA as a means to attempt to 
block or impede oil and gas operations. Although these lawsuits have 
cost the courts, agencies, and applicants substantial time and money, 
they have accomplished no meaningful result (other than delay, as 
intended by the advocacy groups) because, as the courts expressly held 
on all counts, none of the claims raised had any merit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In contrast with the recent politicized process for obtaining an 
MMPA authorization in the Atlantic OCS, the past and existing approach 
to implementing the MMPA in the Arctic has been relatively efficient, 
thorough, effective, and approved by the courts. Yet, advocacy 
organizations have continued to misuse the APA's litigation provisions 
to attempt--unsuccessfully--to impede Arctic oil and gas activities. 
The misguided intentions of these organizations have not only failed in 
court, but the allegations upon which they are supposedly based have 
not borne out in the scientific record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;After decades of oil and gas exploration activities in the Arctic 
and Gulf of Mexico, there is no information demonstrating that any of 
the activities have had anything more than a negligible impact on 
marine mammal. This finding has been repeatedly made by Federal agency 
scientists in numerous public documents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;3c. What effect does it have on the Navy doing their job to protect 
Americans?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer. The U.S. Navy has also been unnecessarily and regularly 
obstructed by legal actions taken against them by various environmental 
groups on challenges to MMPA authorizations for national defense 
training exercises and activities, costing the American taxpayer 
millions of dollars in legal defense funds. For example, after years of 
legal proceedings, the Navy was forced to revisit its mitigation 
strategy related to its plans to use a new submarine detection system, 
known as Low Frequency Active Sonar in order to comply a court's 
interpretation of the MMPA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The regulatory hurdles and requirements that come with complying 
with the MMPA, no doubt, have impacted the U.S. Navy's budget, costing 
in dollars or man hours, including breakdowns for R&amp;amp;D, NEPA document 
preparation, mitigations like observers or PAM, and so on. While I 
cannot speak to whether these requirements impact the Navy as far as 
doing their job to protect Americans, it is certainly impacting their 
budget.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Question 4. It took over 700 days for the previous administration 
to make a decision on permitting, and ultimately deny, a permit to 
conduct seismic surveys to support potential oil and gas development in 
the Atlantic outer-continental shelf.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;4a. How long did it take to provide a similar permit to conduct 
seismic surveys to support other activities, such as offshore 
windfarms, in the same region?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer. There are multiple uses for seismic and other geophysical 
surveys offshore including the siting for wind facilities. Some of the 
recent approvals for geophysical operations, on the Atlantic OCS, for 
offshore windfarms have taken as little as 2 months and we know of no 
example where NMFS has taken upward of 700 days to issue an 
authorization for any offshore activity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;As stated in my written testimony, seismic surveys for `scientific 
research' have been conducted fairly regularly in the Atlantic OCS, in 
addition to other geophysical surveys used to characterize the seabed 
and subsurface for suitability of offshore wind energy facilities. One 
recent `scientific research' survey collected data along 3,000 miles of 
trackline in the area of the Outer Banks, of North Carolina, between 
September and October 2014. NMFS issued an IHA for this survey, which 
used the same technology that is used for oil and gas exploration, in 
less than 7 months from the date the IHA was requested. Another recent 
research seismic survey to record sea level change and its impact on 
the coastline was completed in July 2015 off the New Jersey coast.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;4b. Are you using the same technology to support offshore windfarms 
as to support oil and gas development?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer. While the scale of a given seismic operation can be 
different depending on the given project, seismic and other geophysical 
sources are also used for windfarm siting and development.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Question 5. Many questions were posed regarding seismic operations 
during the hearing. Is there any additional information you wish to 
provide the Committee about seismic operations to more fully address 
those questions?
Representative Soto inquired:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Question/Statement: Regarding seismic in the Atlantic; some of the 
estimates of 130,000 deaths of whales and dolphins as well as a 78 
percent decline in marine fish why were the [Atlantic] applications 
rejected?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer in response to reported impacts on marine mammals: Much has 
been made by environmental groups and the media of the estimate for 
138,000 Level A (potentially injurious) ``takes'' in the BOEM's 
programmatic environmental impact statement addressing the potential 
effects of seismic surveys in the Atlantic OCS. The concept of ``take'' 
is unique to U.S. laws, particularly, the MMPA. Enacted in the early 
1970s to protect species that were on the verge of extinction from over 
hunting and over fishing, it defined ``take'' to mean hunt, harass, 
capture or kill. Unfortunately, it has evolved into something far 
broader, and far tamer, in current sound and marine life regulatory 
issues, which causes confusion because the legal definition of take and 
the common-sense definition are so far apart.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In its March 9, 2015 Science Note, the BOEM itself, says, ``This 
characterization of our conclusion, however, is not accurate; that is 
actually not what we estimate.'' The 138,000 does not reflect actual 
expectation of the number of mammals that will be injured, and 
certainly not killed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; While all survey vessels employ extensive means to detect&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;and prevent potential injurious and behavioral effects, the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;effects of mitigation are not included in the BOEM estimate&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;and would likely even further reduce the actual risk to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;negligible. In fact, the BOEM in its March 2015 Science&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Notes states the number of modeled ``takes'' in the PEIS is&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;grossly over-estimated and does not take into account&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;mitigation measures that will be employed. With mitigations&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;in place, that estimate is ``in far excess of those takes''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;they actually anticipate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Additional conservative assumptions are made about the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;loudness of the sound source, how far it will travel, and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;the level of exposure required to approach injurious&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;effect, as well as other variables like animal abundance&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;and responses to sound. Taken individually these&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;`precautionary' assumptions might be considered&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;``reasonable'' caution in the face of uncertainty about&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;actual source levels, thresholds to effect and propagation&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;of the sound. But when combined in a model, the precautions&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;interact multiplicatively, turning what might seem like&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;reasonable conservatism into literally astronomical&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;overestimates that are thousands or even millions of times&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;greater than the most likely result. As a consequence of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;unaccounted-for precautions in the document, its&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;predictions are literally hundreds of thousands to millions&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;of times over the actual risk. The actual risk most likely&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;ranges between zero and ten, at most with no mortality or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;risk of serious injury. It is unfortunate that seemingly&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;reasonable practices of precaution can be overused to the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;point of such grossly inaccurate over-predictions of risk,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;and we are working to help correct these mathematical&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;anomalies in future risk assessment documents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The bottom line is there are no documented injuries,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;deaths, or significant disturbances from seismic activities&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;in the many decades that seismic has been in regular use in&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;the Gulf and elsewhere around the world. All of these&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;considerations do not mean that we don't appreciate that&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;there may be an undiscovered potential that sound from&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;seismic surveys could have adverse environmental&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;consequences, and we remain committed to taking expensive&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;and elaborate measures to reduce the risk of any such&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;potential, but as-yet undiscovered, effects. That is why we&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;fund independent credible scientific research to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;investigate any reasonable claims of undiscovered effects.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer in response to the rejected permits inquiry: Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management's (``BOEM'') unprecedented decision, dated January 6, 
2017, to deny all six pending applications for seismic surveying of the 
Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf. BOEM's political decision under a 
departing Obama administration disregarded the rule of law by ignoring 
its own environmental impact analyses and conclusions supporting the 
permitting of seismic surveys in the Atlantic OCS, and undermined the 
primary purpose of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (``OCSLA'') by 
preventing the acquisition of data critical to assessing the Nation's 
oil and gas reserves.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;BOEM's previous decision was fundamentally at odds with OCSLA's 
mandate to enable the ``expeditious, orderly development of the oil and 
gas resources of the OCS, with due consideration for the impact of that 
development'' and to ``make [OCS] resources available to meet the 
Nation's energy needs as rapidly as possible.'' See 43 U.S.C. 
Sec. Sec. 1332, 1344, 1802(2)(A) (emphasis added). As explained in the 
enclosed memorandum, the Decision is also inconsistent with OCSLA's 
requirements applicable to exploration permitting, and fails to meet 
basic and well-established standards applicable to Federal agency 
decision making.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;BOEM's denial contradicted what the agency has repeatedly stated: 
that there is no scientific evidence that sound from seismic survey 
activity impacts marine life or the environment. On July 23, 2014, BOEM 
published its Record of Decision (ROD) for Proposed Geological and 
Geophysical Activities in the Mid- and South Atlantic, culminating a 4-
year review evaluating the assumed environmental effects of seismic and 
other geological and geophysical (G&amp;amp;G) survey activities proposed on 
the Atlantic coast. The ROD recommended authorization of exploration 
activities on the Atlantic OCS and formally triggered BOEM's 
consideration of permits for G&amp;amp;G activities. Notwithstanding the ROD's 
recommended mitigation measures that are without any factual or 
scientific support and are overly restrictive, when compared to current 
practices that have been successfully applied by the geophysical 
industry globally, IAGC members still filed applications for G&amp;amp;G 
permits. Subsequently, on January 6, BOEM denied six pending 
applications after languishing for over 2 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Congress never intended that the exploration of the OCS--which is 
critical to the ``expeditious and orderly'' development of the OCS--
could be halted entirely based upon a political administration's 
unsupported assessment of the ``need'' for G&amp;amp;G data or a political 
desire to prevent the ``possibility'' of speculative environmental 
effects that have never before been observed by the agency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;We believe BOEM made the correct decision in overturning the 
previous administration's political decision to deny the permits and 
applaud the reversal to reinstate consideration of those permits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Question/Statement: I have yet to be given one Member of Congress 
to date that actually supports opening up the Atlantic to seismic 
testing. Have you received any Members of Congress supporting this? Is 
it close to 100 that support it? The vast majority of members along the 
east coast oppose it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In addition to my response during the hearing that many Members of 
Congress have weighed in supporting seismic survey activities, I would 
like to note a vote taken last Congress where more than 200 members of 
the House of Representatives voted in support of offshore seismic 
activities. During consideration of H.R. 5538, the FY2017 Interior 
Appropriations bill on July 13, 2016, Representative Murphy of Florida 
offered an amendment to prevent any Federal funding of seismic activity 
offshore Florida. The amendment failed 231-197, disproving 
Representative Soto's assertion that Congress is unsupportive of 
seismic activities offshore.
Representative Huffman inquired:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Question/Statement: ``. . . the sound from air gun activities which 
in fact is an enormous and obvious impact, we're talking about 
something that a blast that is one of the loudest anthropogenic sounds 
in the entire ocean that gets repeated every 10 to 12 seconds for days, 
weeks or even months at a time, it is similar in its decibel level to 
this air gun (airhorn) that I have right here, to put that in context 
this air gun (airhorn) has an output of about 120 decibels, it can be 
heard up to a mile away, it's only a little bit less loud than a jet 
engine at takeoff . . . it's also important to remember that water 
transmits sound differently than air, its actually more efficient . . . 
a significantly loud and frequent blast of noise, I think, would be a 
distraction from our work, wouldn't you agree?''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer/response: While there were many misrepresentations and false 
statements assumed by Representative Huffman in his portrayal of 
seismic surveys and operations, the following information provides 
facts on seismic surveys and the sound they produce.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Specifics on how seismic sources work: Seismic air sources are the 
cleanest, most energy efficient means of putting sound into the 
underlying rock to generate geological imagery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Seismic survey vessels use arrays of different sized air chambers 
towed 200 to 300 meters behind the vessel and approximately 5 to 10 
meters below the sea surface to generate sound pulses. As the vessel 
travels forward the compressed air is released from the array at a 
specific time and distance interval, usually 10-20 seconds and 25-50 
meters apart. The predominantly low-frequency energy travels downwards 
and reflects or refracts off the layers of rock beneath the ocean 
floor. The returning sound waves are detected and recorded by 
hydrophones that are spaced along a series of cables that are towed 
behind the survey vessel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In addition, the sound source array is engineered to direct most of 
its energy downward, rather than laterally, which the National Marine 
Fisheries Service has determined is in itself a mitigation measure. For 
an array with a nominal level of 240 dB peak pressure, the maximum 
measured downward sound level will typically be 10-15 dB less than 
nominal, since the individual sources are separate and will lose some 
energy before they come together in a single sound wave front at some 
distance below the array. Since the array is flat (planar) the sound 
from the individual elements does not synchronize as it does in the 
downward direction, and another 10-15 dB is generally lost. Sitting 
directly below the array the most one would hear might be 225-230 dB, 
but to the side the highest received levels would be even lower, 210-
220 dB, even though the ``nominal'' source level is stated as 240 dB.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;From the immediate vicinity of the array the sound takes multiple 
paths and the sound field can be quite complex. But it will never have 
more energy than it started with, and as a general rule of thumb tends 
to halve with each doubling of distance. Think of the skin of a balloon 
or perimeter of a disk, thinning as it spreads over a larger area in 
three dimensions. Within relatively short distances the sound will 
attenuate to barely audible levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Ambient noise levels in the ocean are generally 80-90 dB, at the 
low frequencies produced by seismic (frequencies below 200 Hz).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In response to sound propagation in water versus air and comparison 
to a jet engine: Sound from a seismic array is not as intense as one 
jet, and each sound pulse lasts only a fraction of a second.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Sounds in water and sounds in air are not comparable&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;because the medium propagating the sound affects its energy&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;and effects. In fact, the units used to discuss sound in&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;water versus air are different, much like if one was to&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;compare temperature but forget to specify whether it's&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;degree Celsius versus degree Fahrenheit. Taking two numbers&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;from two different media and comparing them is misleading&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;and does not offer a realistic measure of the perception of&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;the sound by the listener, especially when the listeners&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;have very different hearing abilities; a given sound heard&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;by a dolphin, whale, dog or human would not be perceived in&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;the same way.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Sound is expressed using a logarithmic scale. So, speaking&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;in a normal voice is literally millions of times ``louder''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;than a whisper in terms of sound pressure or energy. Using&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;expressions like, ``This sound is 100,000 times louder than&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;that sound'' is therefore misleading and untrue, especially&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;when comparing sounds in water with sounds in air.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;In response to the comparison of seismic sources to an airhorn: 
Product claims for the airhorns indicate sound levels around 112-120 dB 
(re 20 microPascal, the in-air scale that differs from the underwater 
scale). Since the seismic air source is designed for a very different 
purpose it turns out to produce sound that is mostly below the range of 
human hearing, barely perceptible and not at all annoying. What is 
louder than an air horn: clapping your hands. A firm handclap will 
produce 130 dB versus a max of 120 dB for the air horn. And like a 
seismic source, the hand clap only lasts a fraction of second, which is 
why hand clapping and seismic source sounds just don't sound as loud to 
us as an airhorn.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;The instantaneous peak pressure of a hand clap or seismic source 
may be greater than the airhorn but doesn't go on long enough to 
generate the mechanical push the ear needs, and so the clapping 
registers as weaker than it really is physically. Sounds need to be 
more than about two-tenths of a second long in order to be heard as 
loud as they really are in terms of physical amplitude.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;There is also a difference in how the two sources produce sound. 
Seismic sources just release the air in a big round bubble. The bubble 
pushes on the water with some oscillations as the bubble rises to the 
surface. In contrast airhorns pass the stream of compressed gas over a 
diaphragm like the reed in a saxophone and it is the vibration of the 
reed that you hear, further amplified by the shape of the horn that the 
sound comes out of. The sound from the escaping gas itself is a faint 
hiss that is drowned out by its activation of a louder sound source, 
the reed and horn, just like a saxophone or clarinet. The gas in the 
airhorn is a ``motor'' to activate the sound source and is not the 
actual source itself as it is in the seismic source.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;It is simply inaccurate and misleading to attempt to compare an 
airhorn to a seismic source and only leads to confusion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Question/Statement: In July of 2016 NOAA completed its guidance for 
assessing the effects of anthropogenic sound on marine mammals, this 
underwent an internal review, three external peer reviews, three public 
comment periods and informal input from partners. Has the science 
changed so profoundly in the last 12 months that we've got to review 
that guidance now?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;Answer/response: I would direct the Congressman to my written 
testimony regarding the need for further review of the acoustic 
guidelines where I stated:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;After completing a set of new acoustic guidelines in July 2015, 
complete with external expert review and an extended public comment 
period, NMFS again failed to implement new guidelines. Then 
unexpectedly on March 16, 2016, NMFS released a third draft of proposed 
revised acoustic guidelines. The third draft did not receive external 
expert peer review before it was sent to the public and NMFS provided 
for only a 14-day public comment period while inexplicably denying all 
reasonable extension requests. Within the short time period allowed for 
review, the experts within the seismic industry concluded that there 
are egregious errors in how NMFS calculated sound impacts on marine 
mammals. In an apparent attempt to appease special interest groups 
inside and outside the agency, NMFS created a biologically unrealistic 
`precautionary' large whale hearing function and selectively removed 
data from the large whale and seal hearing literature to better support 
a modified hearing curve that specifically targeted low frequency sound 
sources like seismic survey sounds. The guidance was finalized in the 
fall of 2016 with only minor changes and included a `short-cut' work-
around purposefully designed to be overly cautious.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;IAGC applauded inclusion of the acoustic guidelines in the 
President's Executive Order earlier this year and will work closely 
with the new Administration to ensure the guidance is amended to 
reflect the best and accurate scientific information. Currently, 
however, NMFS is using the flawed acoustic guidance to (over)estimate 
the amount of takes that may be authorized by the Atlantic IHAs. NMFS's 
inability to issue new acoustic guidance on a timely or straightforward 
basis has resulted in substantial additional delay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations our support for"&gt;                                 ______
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Thank you, Ms. Martin. Again, I would like
to thank all the witnesses for being here today, and for your 
testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;I would also like to remind Members that the Committee's 
Rule 3(d) imposes a 5-minute limit on questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;To begin questions, I will now recognize myself for 5 
minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Mr. Loveday, you described in your testimony how each 
Federal agency has responsibilities under Section 106 of the 
NHPA to identify sites included on or eligible to be included 
on the National Register. Can you go into a little bit more 
detail and describe how agencies actually proceed to identify 
all these properties, and what kind of efforts that entails?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Dr. Loveday. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, under 
the law and the rules, as laid out in 36 CFR 800--and many 
individual agencies also have their own rules for governance 
actions here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The agency, before it does something on its own--that is, 
renovates a building, for example, that it owns, if it is the 
Veterans Administration, or issues a permit or a license if it 
is the FCC, is to make a determination of whether or not that 
action will have an adverse effect on historic sites that are 
on or eligible for the National Register.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The agencies typically will--and it varies from agency to 
agency, how much effort they put into this--the agencies 
typically will do a survey of the area, or a survey of the site 
that the action is taking place on or in. Frequently, they will 
contract with a cultural resource management firm--although 
they can do it with their own staff--have a study done, and use 
that study, then, to make the determination of whether or not 
their actions have an adverse effect.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Then, of course, doing the study they take into account 
public comments, and they take into account the comments of the 
Tribal Historic Preservation Officers and the State Historic 
Preservation Officers, and the local government that is 
responsible for land management issues in that area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    If there is no adverse effect, the agency proceeds. If 
there is an adverse effect, then it consults with the Advisory 
Council on Historic Preservation, and prepares, often, a 
Memorandum of Agreement that spells out how it will minimize 
the adverse effect; or it changes the project so as to 
eliminate or reduce the adverse effect; or it abandons the 
project entirely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;That sounds like quite a time-consuming
endeavor. I know that there is a historic district in my 
hometown of Hot Springs, Arkansas, and there are a lot of 
projects that people are talking about doing there to rebuild 
the downtown. But how long can some of this Section 106 
consultation process take?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Dr. Loveday. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, the 
process varies, of course, depending on the complexity of the 
undertaking. It can take a few weeks. I don't know of any that 
takes less than a few weeks. Or it can take several months.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The longest one that I am aware of is yet to be resolved, 
at least to my knowledge; it goes back to 1988, involving a 
site in upstate New York. That is extreme. Most of the projects 
that I have worked on over the years will get resolved, from 
beginning to end, in a few months, 3 or 4 months.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The State Historic Preservation Officers and, in theory, 
the Tribal Preservation Officers are required to make their 
comments to the agency within 30 days. And there are deadlines 
set for ACHP, the Advisory Council, to make their comments, 
although there are work-arounds on all of those deadlines, so 
that they often get extended because they need more 
information, or the information wasn't adequate, or other 
factors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    So, to answer your question, it is measured in terms of 
months, in most cases. It can be longer, it can be shorter. The 
shortest one I have ever worked on had to do with a project in 
Chicago, and it took 3 weeks.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;I know from my previous experience doing
engineering work that delays in permits, it may be just a few 
months, it may be years, but when you delay a project because 
of a permit, you are tying up financing, you are affecting the 
business model. And a lot of times you would see projects 
cancel because there wasn't enough time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Can you think of instances where you have seen projects 
that didn't go through because of delays in permits or project 
approval?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    Dr. Loveday. I would have to search my memory to come up 
with one.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;In 5 seconds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    Dr. Loveday. But let me suggest to you that the issue here 
is not so much often they don't go through, it is just they get 
delayed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt; And my time has expired, so I will now
recognize Mr. McEachin for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McEachin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;Ms. Leiter, though most hearings in this Subcommittee focus 
on the administration that left the building 6 months ago, I 
wanted to ask you about this Administration. I am particularly 
interested in how it might be in conflict with the intent of 
natural resources laws.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;The Trump administration has used the undefined term 
``energy dominance'' as a way to justify tremendous expansion 
of energy development on public lands. As part of this, they 
seemingly express the belief that multiple use means that all 
uses should be allowed on all lands. More specifically, they 
seem to claim that, at the very least, oil and gas drilling 
should be an allowable use on all multiple-use lands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt;    Is this consistent with how the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act defines multiple use?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;Thank you for the question. No. It isn't
consistent. As I understand it, the multiple-use, sustained 
yield mandate identifies a list of competing uses that should 
be available on the public lands. It does not specify that all 
uses should be available on all lands. And, frankly, that is 
physically impossible. Even just taking industrial uses, 
industrial uses of the surface of the lands often conflict with 
each other.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;    Balancing decisions necessarily have to be made. For 
example, potash and oil and gas cannot co-exist on the surface 
of the same lands. So, one of the activities that the Bureau of 
Land Management in that case has to undertake is to evaluate 
which use is more suitable on a particular parcel of land. And 
that evaluation looks at what the proposed uses are, what the 
interests of the local community and state are, what the 
potential impacts are, what the availability of mitigation 
efforts might be, et cetera. And it is always a super-difficult 
decision and a balance, but it is just not even physically 
possible to manage for all those uses on every piece of land.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McEachin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt; Thank you. In his first 2 months on the job,
Secretary Zinke has had more meetings with oil and gas industry 
executives than representatives of any other type of interest 
group. Could you tell us the implications of this imbalance? 
Could you tell us what the implications of this imbalance are, 
in terms of the legitimacy of DOI decisions regarding the use 
of public resources? And what are the implications of this 
imbalance for the DOI's implementation of FLPMA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;Thank you for that question, as well. Again,
these decisions are very difficult. There are factors on the 
ground in particular areas that, no matter what your interests 
are ahead, you may not be aware of. So, it is very important 
that the agencies be hearing from stakeholders in particular 
areas, who understand what the implications of the decision 
will be for that community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;And the Administrative Procedure Act requires that the 
agency go through an open and transparent and public 
participatory process to make these decisions that involves a 
notice to the affected community, hearing comments from 
everyone in the affected community. Sometimes public hearings 
are specifically required. Sometimes individual meetings with 
tribes are specifically required. The purpose of all of that is 
to ensure that the agency is getting a balanced set of views 
and can reach a reasonable decision and undertake a reasonable 
decision-making process in reaching the decision about how to 
prioritize particular lands in particular cases.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;    So, again, if they are hearing from only one set of 
stakeholders, they are inherently getting a biased view, and 
there are factors that they are likely to miss, which might 
render the decision arbitrary under the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McEachin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt; Thank you for that. And, as quickly as you
can, it is my understanding that you have offered a stark 
warning to the special interest beneficiaries like fossil fuel 
companies of this Administration's largesse who are 
aggressively pushing their agenda. In about 30 seconds, can you 
talk about that warning?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt; I am sorry, I couldn't hear the last part of
the question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McEachin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. McEachin"&gt; Can you talk about that warning,
understanding that we only have about 30 seconds left?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt; I think the question was about the evidence
that they are hearing specifically from a biased set of 
interests. Just to give one example, in evaluating the Bears 
Ears National Monument that President Obama designated and 
President Trump is reviewing, Secretary Jewell took a tour 
across 800 miles of Utah canyon lands with press in tow, held a 
large, public meeting, met with industry, et cetera. The record 
does not reflect that Secretary Zinke had as much input from a 
range of----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The gentleman's time has expired. I now
recognize the gentlelady from American Samoa, Mrs. Radewagen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member. 
I want to welcome the panel and thank you for appearing today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    Ms. Brandt, you mention in your testimony that once the 
application for the listing of your neighborhood on the 
National Register of Historic Places was filed with the State 
Historic Preservation Office, homeowners were notified of the 
nomination and process for objecting. Do you feel that this 
notice was adequate to inform property owners of the 
implications of this designation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Brandt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;Thank you for the question. I don't think that
that notice reaches all of the neighbors in our neighborhood. 
Actually, the city of Portland sent out a notice to all of the 
residents that would be in the historic district. SHPO 
acknowledged letters of objection that came in to those that 
submitted them. I went out and personally got letters of 
objection from my neighbors, and the last one I received was 
from a gentleman that lives half the year in Nevada, had no 
idea his house was surveyed, had no idea whether it was 
considered historic or not, knew nothing about what was going 
on in our neighborhood.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;So, nobody really assumed responsibility. The State Office 
of Historic Preservation sets up a website that has good 
information. The neighborhood association did send out 
information and establish a website, as did Keep Eastmoreland 
Free. I think I was looking from the very beginning for notice 
on both sides that would give me the information I needed to 
make a good decision.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you. That sounds like a no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Brandt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;No.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;    Mrs. Radewagen. What changes to this notification or 
oversight of the process on the Federal level would you suggest 
to better inform homeowners of the effects of listing and their 
rights under the NEPA statute and regulations?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Brandt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;I personally had to do extensive legal research
to understand even the basic elements of the Federal process. 
And I really feel that no one should have to hire lawyers and 
lobbyists to prevent an honorary designation of their house, 
let alone seek an Act of Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;It would have been helpful--you enter into this process in 
supposed consent of the historic district. But individual 
homeowners have to seek out the information to understand the 
Federal regulations and understand the state and city laws that 
support that. So, what changes would I like to be seen? I would 
like to see the onus put on the part of the individual that 
seeks the designation, rather than those who oppose it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Brandt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;In addition to that, I would like to see the
districts be smaller in scale. I would like to see the 45-day 
period be longer, so that the national preservation area could 
actually do a more intensive survey of the information that is 
presented.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;    Mrs. Radewagen. It seems that this National Register 
designation process was fraught with problems and confusion in 
the instance you have described. Do you believe that large 
numbers of properties were intended to be designated as massive 
districts? That would be a yes-or-no question, I think.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Brandt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;No.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;    Mrs. Radewagen. My time is so short. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Brandt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;Not in our case.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;    Mrs. Radewagen. Do you believe the misapplication of the 
process to large districts contributes to some of the problems 
that State Historic Preservation Offices have in implementing 
this law?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Brandt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;Yes, in our case.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;    Mrs. Radewagen. Ms. Brandt, as you mentioned in your 
testimony, could you discuss for us how the National Historic 
Preservation Act is often used to bypass local processes and 
decision making about protections for potential historic sites 
and districts?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Brandt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;I think in our case, in Eastmoreland, the
neighborhood association made the decision to hire a consultant 
to package and propose the district. And I think the reason 
they did that was to limit demolitions in our neighborhood, and 
to restrict housing options.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Ms. Brandt"&gt;    The city of Portland has a re-zoning, called the RIP, going 
on right now that probably will be law in 2018. And that will 
actually re-zone what people can build, within scale, on their 
lots. So, I think our neighborhood, the----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The gentlelady's time has expired. We are
going to move on to more Members' questions. We will go in the 
order that you arrived at the Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. 
Soto.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I prefer to focus my
comments on the attempted plan to have seismic airgun testing 
in the Atlantic. As many of you may know, we had over 100 
Members of Congress from both parties, representing from Maine 
down to Florida, including 21 Members from Florida--11 
Democrats, 10 Republicans--oppose this. I have yet to be given 
one Member of Congress to date that actually supports opening 
up the Atlantic to seismic testing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;We are dealing with a $95 billion economy on the Atlantic 
Coast, 1.4 million jobs. And some of the estimates have been 
that it would lead to 138,000 estimated deaths of whales and 
dolphins, as well as a 78 percent decline in reef fish.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;    It looks like in July of 2014, the Obama administration 
originally approved seismic testing, but then rejected the 
application. Ms. Leiter, why were the applications ultimately 
rejected?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt; So, sorry, that decision actually pre-dates me,
so I am not familiar with the details of why it was rejected. 
But my understanding is that the administration wanted more 
time to look at those impacts that you alluded to. There is 
extensive science on both sides. It is a very complicated 
decision, and I don't think anybody was sitting on anything, I 
think they were looking closely at all of the science.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;It looks like there is some debate over whether
BOEM has ever stated that there is scientific evidence that 
this would affect mammals. In that decision, that is where I am 
getting this statistic, that 138,000 estimated deaths of whales 
and dolphins came from.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;    So, is it true that we have scientific evidence or not 
regarding seismic testing affecting mammals?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;Well, as I said, the decision pre-dates me, but
a group of marine mammal scientists came in to speak to BOEM 
while I was there. They explained that part of the issue is 
that, as with people, no one is testing seismic airguns on a 
whale, so it is all circumstantial evidence of what the impacts 
are.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;    We see that whales avoid areas where it is happening. There 
was a recent study, I think just published last month in the 
journal, Nature, a peer-reviewed study, that suggests that 
seismic activity kills the zooplankton, the small marine 
plankton that are the whales' primary source of food. So, there 
is substantial, but I guess I would call it circumstantial, 
evidence that this has a negative and harmful impact on whales.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt; Ms. Martin, you had suggested in your written
testimony that there was no documented scientific evidence of 
that. Is that still your opinion here today, after the 2014 
decision, and then the 2017 rejection of those applications?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; Congressman, thank you for the question. Yes,
that is still my opinion, and it also reflects the findings 
from the 2016 panel of the National Academy of Sciences, that 
there are no scientific studies that have conclusively 
demonstrated a link between exposure to sound and adverse 
effects on marine mammal populations.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt; But you are a geologist, not a biologist, is that
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; I am actually an attorney.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;OK. I am, too. That is not going to help today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt; Have you received any Members of Congress
supporting the position of the geologists on this from the East 
Coast? Any?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; Certainly. There have been several letters of
support from Congress over this lengthy process pursuing 
seismic surveys.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt; Is it close to 100 that oppose it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; I could not recall off the top of my head how
many we have in support, but there have been numerous letters 
of support and statements of support.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Soto&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;I want to take this moment to remind the
Committee once again we are dealing with a giant tourism, 
fishing economy on the East Coast, one that would make any 
small economic benefit of trying to open this up for oil 
drilling be very short-sighted, and really put in jeopardy the 
economy here in Florida, as well as throughout the East Coast.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Soto"&gt;    As we look at these short-sighted ideas of opening up 
Atlantic drilling, we need to really understand what is at 
risk, what is at stake, and the vast majority of Members on the 
East Coast absolutely, unequivocally, oppose this. I yield 
back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The gentleman yields back. The Chair now
recognizes the gentlelady from Puerto Rico, Miss Gonzalez, for 
5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good 
morning to everybody. Thank you for your testimony, Mr. 
Loveday. I have two questions here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;In my district, Puerto Rico is home for the Arecibo 
Observatory, which is listed under the National Register of 
Historic Places. And the observatory is undergoing a Section 
106 process initiated by the National Science Foundation. The 
National Science Foundation seeks to divest the observatory. I 
have some concerns about the complexities of the process that 
is required to alter a scientific installation listed on the 
National Register.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;My question will be what effect, in your experience, does 
Section 106 have on the decision-making process of private and 
public entities that might seek to change or upgrade scientific 
installations that are listed on the National Register, and are 
still in operation?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Dr. Loveday. If I understand your question, you are asking 
what effect does a nomination or a listing on the Register have 
on upgrades or changes to the property. Is that correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Miss Gonzalez-Colon. In the process, in the decision-making 
process. The installation is already in the National Register, 
so if we were going to make changes, and it is still in 
operation, what kind of impact in decision making might that 
section have in public and private institutions?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Dr. Loveday. Well, first of all, the National Register 
designation, or actual nomination, only applies if there is a 
Federal undertaking. That is the first thing. In theory, it has 
no effect on the private property owner's ability to change or 
alter the property.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Now, having said that, a number of states, a number of 
localities essentially link local laws to the National Historic 
Preservation Act, either directly, as in the case of Oregon, or 
indirectly, by using the same language that appears in the 
Federal law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;So, in reality, the rules and regulations developed for 
National Register sites get transferred to local sites. That is 
the first thing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The second thing is, keep in mind that if there is a 
Federal undertaking in the vicinity of a property, although it 
may not touch the property itself, but a Federal undertaking in 
the vicinity of the property, that requires an agency to review 
that, the agency can, under 106, make a decision about what it 
can or cannot, what its licensee or grantee cannot do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you. And facilitating 
infrastructure improvement is a priority for Congress and this 
Administration. How can the National Historic Preservation Act 
process be streamlined to help deploy critical infrastructure 
updates?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Dr. Loveday. Well, the most important thing, I think, that 
could be done is go back to the original intent of the Act, 
which is to say that 106 applies only--only--to sites that are 
listed on the National Register.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;In other words, get away from this notion of having sites 
that are eligible for the Register, but nobody knows they are 
eligible for the Register until the undertaking is underway, 
crop up and interfere with the process of doing the 
infrastructure improvement. That would be the first thing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The second thing is, institute rules that keep Section 106 
from being used to promote other agendas. It is well known that 
106 is used exclusively by people who have very little interest 
in historic preservation, but they want to block, change, or 
stop a project for other reasons, so they will use the 106 as a 
procedural thing to stop the project until they could build 
support in other ways, or simply slow it down so it becomes so 
expensive that people will abandon a project.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Miss Gonzalez-Colon. And final question, I understand that 
the keeper of the National Register has an independent 
authority to deem properties, including private properties, 
eligible for inclusion on the National Register. What processes 
exist for private landowners to express their concerns with 
such a determination?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Dr. Loveday. I am sorry, I didn't hear the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Again, the keeper of the National 
Register has an independent authority to deem properties, 
including private properties, eligible for inclusion on the 
National Register. What processes exist for private 
landowners----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The gentlelady's time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    Miss Gonzalez-Colon. I will submit it in writing, then, my 
question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt; We will move on. The Chair now recognizes
the gentleman from the 1st District of Missouri, Mr. Clay, for 
5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Clay&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Mr. Clay"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank the witnesses
for participating in this hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Mr. Clay"&gt;Ms. Leiter, as you mentioned in your testimony, this 
Administration has solicited feedback from various industries 
about which safeguards of our health and the environment should 
be attacked. I will note that my colleagues on this 
Subcommittee are following suit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Clay"&gt;The former Chairman and Vice Chairman sent letters on May 
9, 2017, to nearly 50 trade associations and companies, 
soliciting feedback on ``burdensome government regulations or 
processes under the Subcommittee's jurisdiction.'' None were 
sent to citizen environmental groups or the public health 
community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Mr. Clay"&gt;    How does that kind of lopsided solicitation for feedback 
decrease transparency?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;Thank you for the question. I think the
solicitation of input is a very positive thing. The concern 
arises when the solicitation is one-sided, so that other 
interests cannot figure out how to weigh in on the question 
that is being asked.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;So, in the example of the regulatory reform request for 
comments, the Federal Register notice lays out that the 
Administration is looking for, as you said, identification of 
burdensome regulations, regulations that are ineffective, 
regulations whose costs, in the view of the commenter, exceed 
their benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;It is very hard, as someone who supports public health 
regulations, supports environmental regulation, et cetera, to 
figure out what the targets are likely to be, and how best to 
defend against the claim that those targets are burdensome.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;    So, the request for comments, essentially, gives industry a 
checklist of ways to identify regulations as burdensome, but 
does not similarly give regulatory beneficiaries any indication 
of what the targets are likely to be, or how to respond.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Clay&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Mr. Clay"&gt; So, really, there is a lack of balance here, as
far as what works appropriately to protect the environment, to 
protect health, versus what burdens are on industry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt; Right. I mean the Administration is likely to
hear that these numerous regulations are burdensome because, by 
definition, regulations do burden someone. So, someone is going 
to come in and say almost every regulation is burdensome in 
some way. But they are not going to hear from the corresponding 
beneficiaries who say, OK, that is a burden, but that is a 
burden that is forcing the industry to internalize a set of 
costs that were otherwise being imposed on our community.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Clay&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Clay"&gt;I see. Ms. Leiter, Ms. Martin stated in her
testimony that ``advocacy organizations have continued to 
misuse the APA's litigation provisions to attempt 
unsuccessfully to impede Arctic oil and gas activities,'' and 
that it is necessary to reduce ``the ability for outside 
special interest groups to obstruct energy exploration'' to 
ensure continued development.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Clay"&gt;    Ms. Leiter, during your time as Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Land and Minerals at the Interior from August 2015 to 
January 2017, did you find that advocacy organizations misused 
the Administrative Procedure Act litigation provisions?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;Thank you for the question. I have several
responses to that. The first is that advocacy groups tend to 
sue more in what they view as disfavorable administrations, and 
industry groups tend to sue more in what they view as 
disfavorable administrations. So, there is sort of a shifting 
balance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;My understanding is that the numbers overall reflect that 
industry sues over natural resource policy more often than 
NGOs, but I have not seen published statistics on that. I have 
just seen an informal study.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt;    But the bigger point I would make is that if the lawsuit is 
successful, then an impartial judge, in theory, has determined 
that the agency did over-reach. If the lawsuit is unsuccessful, 
then an impartial judge has determined that the agency did not 
over-reach. But asking a judge to make that determination is 
not a misuse of our Administrative Procedure Act, it is merely 
a request for input.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt; The gentleman's time has expired.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt; Sorry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Clay&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Clay"&gt; Thank you, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Move on to the next questions from the
gentleman from the 2nd District of California, Mr. Huffman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    You are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Huffman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I really hope the
American people are watching, not just the insiders and 
industry lobbyists that are very familiar with this Committee 
and these hearings, but regular folks who care about the 
environment and are disgusted with the rigged system where 
special interests wag the dog of public policy in Congress, 
because here we are again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;And this is becoming a familiar theme in this Congress, 
talking about rolling back environmental protections in order 
to boost dirty energy production. That is such an emerging 
trademark of this Congress and this Administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;When the Interior Secretary was here recently to talk about 
a budget that proposed $1.6 billion in funding cuts, Secretary 
Zinke said, ``That is what a balanced budget looks like.'' 
However, it was a budget balanced by seeking no concessions at 
all from the oil and gas industry, while rolling back 
environmental protections, including shuttering the Marine 
Mammal Commission, which is the crucial scientific agency 
responsible for overseeing implementation of the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;And in a recent Executive Order, the President even opened 
the door to removing the scientific guidance in place for 
assessing anthropogenic sound, one of the subjects of this 
conversation today, on the hearing of marine mammals and their 
behaviors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;So, at the same time that we are having a hearing to say 
there is no science to support existing protections for marine 
mammals, this Administration, with the help of this Congress, 
is working to eliminate existing scientific guidance and, 
potentially, to eliminate the agency that is best equipped to 
answer these questions and to advise Congress on this issue. I 
guess the preference is to just get the answers from industry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;We are talking about the development of offshore energy and 
its impacts on marine habitat, and the sound from airgun 
activities, which, in fact, is an enormous and obvious impact. 
We are talking about a blast that is one of the loudest 
anthropogenic sounds in the entire ocean that gets repeated 
every 10 to 12 seconds for days, weeks, or even months at a 
time. It is similar in its decibel level to this airgun that I 
have right here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;To put that in context, this airgun has an output of about 
120 decibels. It can be heard up to a mile away. It is only a 
little bit less loud than a jet engine at takeoff, so we are 
talking about something that is enormously impactful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;And it is also important to remember that water transmits 
sound differently than air. It is actually more efficient. So, 
the same sound in water and air can actually have a greater 
impact in certain situations in water.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;Ms. Martin, you claim in your testimony that the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act was not originally designed to regulate 
sound in the marine ecosystem. But it was absolutely designed 
to protect essential habitats for each species of marine mammal 
from the adverse effect of man's actions. And it was designed 
specifically to prevent harassment in order to protect marine 
mammals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;    So, just considering our context here in this Committee 
room, a significantly loud and frequent blast of noise, I 
think, would be a distraction from our work. Wouldn't you 
agree? Would you like me to sound off this airgun actually 
every 10 to 12 seconds? Do you think your testimony would 
benefit from that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; Congressman, I appreciate the prop, but----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Huffman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt; I am just asking if you would like me to blast
the airgun. With the Chairman's permission, I mean, I am happy 
to do it if it is needed to make the point. You probably don't 
want me to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt; I will remind the gentleman that would be a
violation of House decorum.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Huffman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt; We don't want to do that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt; No.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Huffman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;We don't want to do that. We don't want to
hurt people's eardrums, we don't want to destroy the habitat 
that we are trying to function in right now. And we should 
bring the same common sense to our oceans and our marine 
mammals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;In July of 2016--I am going to continue with you and give 
you a chance to speak, Ms. Martin--NOAA completed its technical 
guidance for assessing the effects of anthropogenic sound on 
marine mammals. This underwent an internal review, three 
external peer reviews, a follow-up peer review, three public 
comment periods, and informal input from dozens of Federal 
agency partners and private-sector stakeholders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt;    Ms. Martin, has the science changed so profoundly in the 
last 12 months that we have to review that guidance right now?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;Thank you for the question, and uncertainty
over that development of the acoustic guidance process, 
including the three drafts, as you have mentioned, and 
eventually final guidance, has been one of the major delays and 
uncertainties that has riddled the Atlantic permitting process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;    Industry stakeholders have also commented often at each 
step of the review. And this latest review and final guidance--
and now, as you mentioned earlier, it is under review again by 
Executive Order--pinpoints problems with----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The gentleman's time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    I am now pleased to recognize the Vice Chairman of the Full 
Committee, the previous Chairman of this Subcommittee, the 
gentleman from the 1st District of Texas, Mr. Gohmert.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gohmert&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt; If the gentleman would allow me to yield to
him, how many decibels does that make?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Huffman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt; One hundred and twenty.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gohmert&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;Wow, OK. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;I really appreciate the witnesses here, because this is an 
important hearing. This is critical. Marine mammals are 
suffering from one of the most egregious things that is being 
allowed to happen, and hopefully, as a result of this hearing, 
we can find a way to stop noises that are 120 decibels. And I 
am talking, of course, about the most common 120-decibel sound 
that is made, and that does so much enormous damage--to quote 
my friend--to mammals. I am, of course, talking about thunder.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;    Thunder in the clouds, we have to find a way to stop it, 
because it is wreaking havoc, and doing enormous damage to 
our----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Huffman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Huffman"&gt; But would the gentleman----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gohmert&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;No, I am not----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;    Mr. Huffman [continuing]. Yield to identify a marine mammal 
that lives in the clouds, please?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gohmert&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;They don't--I don't live in the clouds, as
opposed to some of my friends, and yet I can tell you air horns 
do not normally--they are a bother, and they bother me a lot at 
sports events, but they bother me and I live on the ground. And 
even when I am underwater in a pool or ocean, thunder shakes 
things. My point is, and for some of our friends that don't 
understand sarcasm, there are things that occur in nature that 
are beyond any man-made ability to even come close to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;But I want to go directly back to Ms. Martin. You note to 
date that there are no verified injuries or deaths of marine 
mammals from exposure to sounds produced during seismic 
surveys. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National 
Marine Fisheries Service stated this fact many times. Yet 
environmentalists keep claiming that these tests will result in 
hundreds of thousands of injuries and deaths to marine mammals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;    So, I need to know. Do these estimates take into account 
monitoring and mitigation practices that surveyors are required 
to implement per the agency regulations?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;Congressman, I appreciate the question. Simple
answer is no, they do not. In fact, those estimates and the 
often-quoted 138,000 injuries or deaths is an extreme 
exaggeration of the MMPA take estimation. Those are simply 
estimates of exposure to sound, not actual impacts estimated to 
occur.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt;    And Dr. Bill Brown of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management 
said himself that 138,000 was an exaggeration, a conservative 
assumption built on conservative analysis, and they did not 
expect any of those exposures or impacts to occur.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gohmert&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt; We know thunder has been at 120 decibels. I
don't know of any way to mitigate those sounds. They do 
transfer and the sound waves do travel underground, or 
underwater. But with successful use of mitigation practices, is 
it realistic to say that a seismic survey will result in 
hundreds of thousands of marine mammal deaths?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; Again, thank you for the question. No, it is
not a reasonable statement to make.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gohmert&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt; Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, a
take--t-a-k-e--is broadly defined as an act that has the 
potential to injure a marine mammal or cause a change in 
behavior. Would a change in behavior include an animal swimming 
away, or perhaps swimming up to a seismic survey to interact 
with a vessel?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; That is correct. A change of behavior includes
a simple change in direction of a swim pattern of the marine 
mammal.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gohmert&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt; So, any change, including swimming up and
becoming friendly, would be considered a take?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; That is correct, under current definition under
Marine Mammal Protection Act.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gohmert&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;Since the definition of take is so broad,
then, the permitting process does not take into account the 
effects of mitigation practices. So, it is not surprising at 
all that these seismic surveys come with such high estimates or 
potential takes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt;    Would you agree that these estimates are often misleading 
in numbers, since the takes can include just swimming away, or 
swimming up to a vessel?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; Congressman, I would agree that by not
incorporating mitigation measures into the estimates, they are 
overly conservative. But I would also point to the consistent 
findings of thriving, stable marine life populations alongside 
seismic surveying in both the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and the 
Gulf of Mexico, where seismic surveys have been conducted for 
over 50 years.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gohmert&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"&gt; And again, I would----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The gentleman's----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;    Mr. Gohmert [continuing]. Direct my friends back to the 
Gulf of Mexico, where drilling with loud noise has produced an 
enormous amount of new underwater life. Thank you. I yield 
back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt; The Chair now recognizes and welcomes to the
Committee the gentleman from Louisiana, who is not only a 
strong advocate for the economic vitality of the Gulf of 
Mexico, but also for the environmental vitality. He has done a 
lot of work restoring wetlands. The Chair recognizes Mr. Graves 
for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My friend from
California, is that the same one you had last night at the 
party? I thought it was out of air.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Thank you all very much for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;I really wish we had someone from the Administration here, 
but, Professor, I think I am going to pick on you a little bit, 
if that is OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;I am from south Louisiana, as the Chairman mentioned. We 
have an incredibly robust environment, coastal area, one of the 
most ecologically productive places on the North American 
continent, produces more fisheries than anywhere else in the 
Continental United States, and a really important part of our 
culture, our economy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;What happened is back in the 1930s, after the Great Flood 
of 1927, the Corps of Engineers came in and began building 
levees along the river system. And when they did, they cut off 
all of this fresh water and sediment that was coming down the 
river, draining from Montana into Canada to New York, and used 
to result in a delta building in a growing deltaic plain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;After the Corps finished that, it immediately reversed to 
land loss. And, in fact, we have lost approximately 1,900 
square miles of our coast, the size of Delaware. In fact, 
larger than the size of Delaware. And our efforts to try to 
restore the coast, which is entirely an environmental project, 
one important component of that--in fact, I would argue the 
most important component--is reconnecting the river with the 
adjacent wetlands. Restoring that sediment flow, that fresh 
water flow.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;NOAA recently came to us, and in regard to the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act. It appears that it is going to take them 
5 years to complete their MMPA analysis. Five years. I want to 
be clear. No one did an MMPA analysis to determine the impact 
of putting these levees on the river, the loss of 1,900 square 
miles of this productive coastal wetland area. Yet, we are 
going to delay this project. And I want to be clear: delay. We 
have nearly $1 billion in non-Federal funds in the bank today 
to implement this project.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Do you see that as being proper execution of environmental 
laws, to delay an environmental project for 5 years like that, 
or do you think that perhaps there is a better balance that 
could be struck there?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt; Thank you for the question. I thought you were
going to ask me to defend the Corps of Engineers. But----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Well, it is their fault.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Ms. Leiter [continuing]. Thankfully, you did not. I mean it 
is a very difficult question. I am not familiar with the 
details of that particular permitting process. It certainly 
sounds like a worthwhile project, and it sounds as though, from 
the point of view of the Gulf, it may be unfortunate that there 
are delays.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    What I would say is that it is a very difficult process to 
evaluate impacts. You need to take a lot of input from all 
sides. And I can well imagine--I don't know why 5 years, but I 
can well imagine that it would be a long process to evaluate 
the impacts on a marine mammal population. And they have to do 
the scientific analysis thoroughly, because they don't want to 
make a decision as the Corps did----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; But what about the impact on the people, on the
fishers, just the ecological productivity? Is there not an 
offsetting consideration here?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Leiter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Ms. Leiter"&gt; I think the problem is that, historically, and
even in the present, we sometimes undertake major actions that 
have impacts that we didn't realize. So, this sounds like quite 
a major undertaking, and I think NOAA's idea is to make sure 
that it is not going to have unforeseen impacts on marine 
mammal populations.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;I think NOAA's schedule is absurd, I do. I
think it is absurd, and I think it is going to result in 
additional land loss needlessly, additional environmental 
impacts needlessly. I think it is absurd.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Ms. Martin, your testimony, you indicated that the intent 
behind the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the intent of 
Congress was forward thinking and innovative. Do you view that 
as being consistent with the implementation of MMPA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; I would say that the implementation of the MMPA
by both bureaucracies and by exploitation of advocacy groups 
today has strayed from Congress' original intent, which was to 
focus on direct actual impacts to marine mammal populations.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; Also, I wanted to see if you could clarify. My
friend from California keeps making noises underwater, and is 
concerned about impacts. Have there been documented impacts as 
a result of acoustic impacts on marine mammals, that you are 
aware of?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; There have been no documented evidence of
seismic----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; And is that your opinion? Is that a Trump
administration opinion? Or is that shared by previous 
administrations, such as Obama and Clinton, as well?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Martin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Ms. Martin"&gt; That is the opinion stated repeatedly by two
independent agencies throughout changing political 
administrations.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt; Great, thank you very much. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Westerman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;I would like to thank the witnesses for
their valuable testimony and the Members for their questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The members of the Committee may have some additional 
questions for the witnesses, and we will ask you to respond to 
these in writing. Also, if you have any suggestions on how 
these rules could be improved, please include those in your 
summaries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Under Committee Rule 3(o), members of the Committee must 
submit witness questions within 3 business days following the 
hearing, and the hearing record will be held open for 10 
business days for these responses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;If there is no further business, without objection, the 
Subcommittee stands adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;[Whereupon, at 11:25 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;American Cultural Resources Association&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;July 18, 2017
Hon. Bruce Westerman, Chairman,
Hon. A. Donald McEachin, Ranking Member,
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,
Committee on Natural Resources,
Washington, DC 20515.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Dear Members of Congress:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;We are concerned about the inclusion of the NHPA in your hearing 
today entitled, ``Examining Impacts of Federal Natural Resources Laws 
Gone Astray, Part II.'' America's relationship with its past changed 
fundamentally when Congress passed the National Historic Preservation 
Act (NHPA) more than 50 years ago and formally recognized historic 
preservation as an important policy of the United States. These 
sentiments still inspire:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The Congress finds and declares that (a) the spirit and direction 
of the Nation are founded upon and reflected in its historic heritage; 
(b) the historical and cultural foundations of the Nation should be 
preserved as a living part of our community life and development in 
order to give a sense of orientation to the American people . . .&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The American people took those words to heart in the last half-
century, transforming their communities from coast to coast through 
historic preservation and generating widespread social and economic 
impacts. The NHPA established the legal framework and incentives to 
preserve historic buildings, landscapes, and archaeological sites. 
These heritage resources shape our sense of place, anchor economic 
revitalization, and ensure a more sustainable future for our nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The NHPA helps stabilize neighborhoods and downtowns, contributes 
to public education, attracts investment, creates jobs, generates tax 
revenues, supports small business and affordable housing, and powers 
America's heritage tourism industry. Publicly owned historic 
properties, from community landmarks to federal facilities and national 
parks, also maintain community pride and identity, aid local and 
regional economies through their operation and maintenance, and foster 
a variety of public uses. Grants from the Historic Preservation Fund 
have supported restoration of historic treasures, assisted with 
community recovery from disasters, and improved history education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;We are particularly concerned about the Committee's emphasis on 
Section 106 of the NHPA, which requires the federal government to seek 
input from local communities when planning federally supported 
development in their backyards. Compliance with federal requirements 
has engaged and empowered local communities across the country in 
better planning for development and provided communities with an 
important voice in federal decision-making. For public officials 
concerned about protecting the rights of localities and states against 
too heavy a federal hand, Section 106 is an asset--not an obstacle. 
Even so, Section 106 is a procedural review, and it requires the 
federal government only to take into account adverse effects on 
historic properties. It does not mandate preservation of historic 
places.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;Section 106 requires the government to take into account adverse 
effects to historic properties that are listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places or are eligible for listing on the Register. By 
including properties that are eligible for listing, the government 
conserves financial resources. For example, the Department of the Army 
in regulation AR 200-1 instructs installations to nominate for the 
National Register only properties that will be transferred out of 
federal management, and to go to the expense of nominating properties 
only when justified by exceptional circumstances. Preparing nominations 
to the National Register is a costly endeavor, and we support 
Congress's long-settled decision in 1976 to amend the NHPA to include 
consideration of properties eligible for listing, saving substantial 
taxpayer dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The National Register is by no means a complete accounting of our 
nation's historic heritage, and removing eligible sites from 
consideration would leave out places critical to our communities and 
our understanding of the nation's history. Congress's determination 
that eligible properties should be considered in the Section 106 
process means that the federal government has been required to consider 
adverse effects of its undertakings on such iconic places as the 
remains of the World Trade Center in New York (determined eligible but 
not listed), Arlington National Cemetery (not listed on the National 
Register until 2014), the Blue Ridge Parkway (determined eligible but 
not listed) and the Lumpkin's Slave Jail site in Richmond, Virginia 
(determined eligible, but not listed). Absent the eligibility 
consideration, projects proposed on or near sites like these would have 
no legal obligation to weigh adverse effects. Investigations of 
eligible sites impacted by projects across America has allowed us to 
the tell the stories of the diverse communities that have contributed 
to the development of our great nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Westerman"&gt;The American Cultural Resources Association (ACRA) is comprised of 
private-sector cultural resource management firms with deep experience 
helping clients efficiently align their projects with the goals of the 
Section 106 process. We are pleased to share our expertise with the 
Committee as you consider ways to continue to improve the Section 106 
process. Unfortunately, changing the process to remove eligible 
properties from consideration will only dramatically increase the cost 
of Section 106 reviews by requiring formal nominations to the National 
Register and serve to undermine our nation's long-standing commitment 
to historic preservation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
