    &lt;option&gt;                     FROM THE STATE OF UTAH
    The Chairman. Let me recognize myself for my original 
opening statement.
    Mr. Zinke, I want to welcome you back here to the 
Committee. It is good to have you back here in this particular 
room. I want to personally thank you at the very beginning for 
being here.
    I also want to thank you for visiting my home state, and 
for doing that. You and your Department have brought 
transparency, more transparency over the past few months than I 
think has happened in the entire 111-year history of the 
Antiquities Act. What you did was a first-of-its-kind, 
inclusive process that actually tried to assess local support 
for monuments. And I want to thank you for conducting that 
review, you did it with aplomb, even if you made fun of what I 
was wearing. I was not going to a golf course, I was 
legitimate.
    You also, I think, are bringing a breath of fresh air to 
the Department. You clearly understand why the Department was 
created and what its core statutory functions are, and how they 
have strayed over the few years. Mismanagement, as I view it, 
of Federal lands did not start recently. It has gone on for 
several decades, long before the Obama administration was 
there. But I have to admit the layers of arbitrary rules and 
regulations over the past 8 years, especially the last 2 years, 
seem to compound the challenges that we have with the 
Department of the Interior.
    So, what I hope to do is be able to have a new relationship 
that is here that will work in concert with you to give you 
whatever kinds of tools are necessary to produce the kinds of 
reforms that you have been talking about in public.
    Over the past few months, you have taken numerous actions 
to re-establish core agency functions and begin addressing 
regulatory excesses. I am very proud of you for doing that. You 
have facilitated a diverse and abundant energy development 
strategy, and made clear your priorities for things like the 
USGS funding increase, offshore development, the 5-year 
planning process, which, I think, shows a commitment to make 
America stronger through energy security. I appreciate you 
doing that.
    I am also appreciative, especially for this Committee, of 
your prioritization of resource needs to address the Park 
Service's massive deferred maintenance backlog. Once again, 
that is something that must take place.
    A component of that strategy does include the transferring 
and exchanging of surplus lands. I want to be clear about this, 
that this does not mean a wholesale transfer of Federal lands. 
There are voices out there who are spreading misinformation, if 
not downright lies, that our goal is to try to sell off all the 
iconic areas and landmarks, when actually nobody is talking 
about that.
    What we are talking about, and clearly understanding, is we 
have to resolve the checkerboard issues of land management, 
isolated and hard-to-manage isolated parcels of land, and 
selected transfers that would maximize local communities. That 
is merely what we were talking about. That is the goal and the 
effort of where we were going.
    I am also encouraged to hear your public statements, 
specifically concerning federally recognized Indian tribes. 
These Native American issues are important. Many people in the 
past have given lip service to tribal self-determination, but 
their actions have consistently fallen very short of the 
rhetoric that is there.
    So, the idea that you have established and desire to 
improve tribal control over tribal lands, rather than 
blockading economic opportunities in Indian Country is 
refreshing, and I appreciate that.
    I also want to thank you for the broader reforms that you 
have talked about, and I want to let you know that this 
Committee is ready to try to do whatever legislation you feel 
is necessary to help you succeed in those kind of broader 
reforms that you wish to do.
    We all realize that there is a $20 trillion deficit that 
all of us have inherited. What you need to do is, with the 
funds that are available, try to leverage the natural resources 
and the responsibilities that go with that, develop the energy 
potential.
    We realize the amount of revenue that has come in has 
deteriorated over the years, but also access to public land has 
deteriorated over the years, as well as the level of service. I 
am grateful that the Department realizes that and is going to 
take positive efforts to try to improve on all three of those 
areas. I hope that what we can do is to build a future together 
with your Department to serve the communities that your 
Department actually serves.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;   Prepared Statement of the Hon. Rob Bishop, Chairman, Committee on 
                           Natural Resources
    Today, we are pleased to have Secretary Zinke here to testify on 
the Administration's budget and broader policy priorities for the 
Department of the Interior.
    Welcome back to the Committee, Mr. Secretary.
    I'd first like to take a quick moment to personally thank you for 
being here and for recently visiting my home state of Utah. Your 
Department has brought more transparency and accountability to National 
Monument designations in the past few months than the rest of the 
Antiquities Act's 111-year history by creating a first-of-its-kind, 
open, and inclusive process to gather public comments and assess local 
support for National Monuments. Thank you for conducting this review.
    After 8 years, it is a breath of fresh air to have someone leading 
the Department who understands the reason why it was created in the 
first place--and just how far its core statutory functions have strayed 
since that time.
    Although mismanagement of our Federal lands and Washington's 
neglect of local, state and tribal communities began long before the 
Obama administration, the layers of arbitrary rules and regulations 
promulgated over the past 8 years have certainly compounded these 
challenges.
    Congress and the executive branch working in concert is the only 
way for us to overcome years of mismanagement at the Interior 
Department and its sub-agencies. As such, I am excited to have you in 
this role, and an Administration committed to reform, so that we can 
finally partner with the executive branch to actually solve problems 
and help improve the Department's accountability to taxpayers.
    In just the first few months of the Secretary's tenure, the 
Department has taken numerous actions to re-establish core agency 
functions and begin addressing regulatory excesses created by the last 
administration.
    The President's 2018 budget reflects a commitment from the Trump 
administration to increase access to Federal lands, reduce burdensome 
regulation, and improve conservation without unduly impacting economic 
development.
    I am also pleased with several clear priorities put forward within 
this request to help facilitate a diverse and abundant energy 
development strategy. From supporting onshore development through 
increased USGS funding in mineral assessments, to offshore development, 
with the re-initiation of the 5-year plan process, you've committed to 
making America stronger through energy security.
    I am also pleased with the Administration's commitment to improve 
management of existing Federal lands and resources rather than growing 
the bureaucracy and siphoning money from productive uses to expand 
Federal land acquisition. This includes prioritizing resources to 
address the Park Service's massive deferred maintenance backlog.
    A component of this strategy must include transferring or 
exchanging surplus lands in and around local communities. To be clear, 
this does not mean a wholesale transfer of our Federal lands. There are 
special interests and voices out there spreading lies who want the 
public to think these efforts amount to selling iconic parks or 
landmarks, when nobody here is talking about that. We--members of both 
political parties--are simply talking about resolving checkerboard land 
issues, removing isolated and hard to manage parcels, and selectively 
transferring certain lands to maximize the benefits of those lands to 
local communities.
    I've been very encouraged to hear your public statements about 
improving self-determination for our First Americans, federally 
recognized Indian tribes. Under previous administrations there's been a 
lot of lip service paid to tribal self-determination, but actions have 
consistently fallen short of the rhetoric. I look forward to working 
with you to actually improve tribal control over tribal lands rather 
than blockading economic opportunities for Indian Country.
    The shared priorities of balancing our budget, improving land 
management and expanding access can't be fully achieved without broader 
reforms. So, in addition to our discussion on budget priorities, I also 
look forward to hearing your thoughts on how this Committee can provide 
the Administration with the tools necessary for it to succeed.
    Amidst a nearly $20 trillion national debt that they inherited, I 
commend President Trump and Secretary Zinke for putting forward a 
responsible and strategic budget to leverage the Nation's natural 
resources and to responsibly explore and develop America's energy 
potential. This Committee is dedicated to working with you, the 
Administration and our colleagues in Congress to build a better future 
for the Department and the communities it serves.
    I yield back.
                                 ______
    The Chairman. Before I yield to Mr. Grijalva I do want to 
make one formal announcement simply that deals with the decorum 
under the Committee Rules, as well as the Rules of the House.
    And I have to ask, since this is a formal Committee 
hearing, that there not be any disruptions regarding the 
testimony that is going to be given here today. It is important 
to respect the decorum and the rules of the Committee and the 
House, and to allow Members and the public to hear those 
proceedings.
    With that, I am appreciative, and I will yield to the 
Ranking Member, Mr. Grijalva, for his opening statement.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA
    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Mr. 
Secretary. Not too long ago you sat up here with us, and I am 
sure you are full of fond memories of that experience and your 
time with us. Being in the Majority is still more fulfilling, I 
could tell you that, but our side has a role, an important 
role. And we appreciate the opportunity to exercise our 
oversight responsibility today, our shared oversight 
responsibility. So, thank you very much for being here.
    Much of what comes from the Trump White House is not true, 
but the President's 2018 budget tells us the truth. My 
Republican colleagues can run from it or claim this budget is 
DOA, but this is an honest Republican budget. I don't mean the 
math is honest, because it is not. This budget double counts 
non-existent savings from tax cuts as a gimmick to pretend to 
balance. The math in this budget is disingenuous, at best, and 
needs to be treated as such.
    But the budget is an honest reflection of Republican long-
held priorities. If Speaker Ryan brought an Interior 
appropriations bill to the Floor that included a 10 percent 
cut, as this proposal does, House Republicans would pass it.
    It seems that every time we have a Republican in the White 
House, we suddenly hear that the richest nation on earth is 
flat broke, cannot afford these programs any more, and all of a 
sudden the talk is about doing more with less, tightening our 
belts, and making sacrifices. We don't see in this budget oil, 
gas, mining making sacrifices, nor polluters funding cleanups 
in the mess that they create and leave behind.
    The budget reflects the bottomless desire for irresponsible 
drilling and mining on every inch of public land. They even 
insist on doing permanent damage to the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge, even when we know it will not help average 
Americans at all.
    The budget reflects Republican's constant attacks on 
science and repeated claims that climate change is fake. OMB 
Director Mulvaney, who was a House Republican until recently, 
told the truth when he said Republicans think spending on 
climate change is a waste of money.
    The budget reflects their endless campaign to sell off 
public lands that the American people love. Years of Republican 
bills and speeches demonizing Federal lands, and Federal 
employees, prove that House Republicans support a budget that 
would close national parks and force layoffs of Federal land 
managers, as well.
    Some of my Republican colleagues claim they support the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund, but for years they have 
allowed false claims about the program to go unchallenged. They 
have voted to undermine the fund, and they even allowed it to 
expire on their watch. Of course, they support a budget that 
slashes LWCF funding by 85 percent.
    This budget reflects the Republican belief that this 
generation of politicians gets to decide which species go 
extinct, and their conviction that extinction is better than 
reasonable limits on drilling or mining.
    The budget guts the Fish and Wildlife Service and makes a 
functioning Endangered Species Act impossible, and that is the 
goal.
    There is no confusion about where Democrats stand. We 
support full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
We support the funding levels needed to operate a world-class 
system of national parks, forests, refuges, and public lands. 
We believe our climate is changing and that money spent on 
research, stopping pollution, and mitigation are the most 
important investments we can make. We support Federal spending 
to improve the health of our oceans and fisheries. We support 
funding for programs that pull endangered species back from the 
brink. And, we support investments to make permanent 
improvements in the quality of life in Indian Country.
    The President's misguided and irresponsible budget does 
none of these things. The Trump budget is just standard 
Republican talking points in budget form. The Trump budget is 
the Republican vision for this country, spelled out in dollars 
and cents.
    Democrats have resisted these destructive proposals before, 
and we will do so again.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;   Prepared Statement of the Hon. Raul M. Grijalva, Ranking Member,

                                 ______
    Mr. Grijalva. With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you. Otherwise, everything is OK, 
right?
    Mr. Grijalva. Yes.
    The Chairman. All right, good. The Vice Chairman has waived 
his right to give an opening statement, so we will go directly 
to Mr. Zinke, if you would.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here. It is the 
Honorable Ryan Zinke, Secretary of the Department of the 
Interior, and you are accompanied by Olivia Barton Ferriter--
did I say that correctly--who is also the Deputy Assistant for 
Budget and Finance within Interior, as well as Denise Flanagan 
from the Director of the Office of Budget in the Interior 
Department.
    We welcome all three of you here. I remind our witnesses, 
obviously, you all know how the 5-minute rule works. Also, the 
microphones are not self-activated, so make sure you turn it on 
before you speak there.
    With that, welcome back, Secretary. It is all yours.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;                  THE INTERIOR, WASHINGTON, DC
    Secretary Zinke. Thank you. I am glad to see the tenor has 
not changed between the Ranking Member and the Chairman. But 
thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today, and 
it is indeed a deep honor to be on this side of the podium.
    I do request permission to submit my entire statement for 
the record.
    So, the budget. This is what a balanced budget looks like. 
It is a starting point. And it is good to have discussions on 
what a balanced budget would look like. Many Members identify 
areas of concern in it, and I completely understand that. But 
you cannot ignore every year Congress goes through and looks at 
raising the debt, and you cannot ignore a budget that is in 
arrears.
    So, while this budget focuses on savings for many of you, I 
will also address the revenue picture. But this is what a 
budget, a balanced budget, would look like. And there are tough 
decisions, and it is good to have honest dialogue about them.
    Second, I fully understand the Department of the Interior 
touches the lives of more Americans than any other department. 
In fact, nearly every American lives within an hour drive of 
our public lands, enjoys our parks, our wildlife refuges, and 
our public lands. Interior is not a partisan issue. Our public 
lands are an American issue.
    The President's budget itself proposes $11.7 billion, and 
saves the taxpayers about $1.6 billion. We make strategic 
investments to ensure that our Nation's energy and national 
security are met, and we address core issues, and public 
access.
    The President's budget prioritizes an all-of-the-above 
energy strategy that includes oil, gas, coal, and renewable 
energies. The President does not favor one energy source over 
another. It is an all-of-the-above energy strategy. We also 
have a prudent focus on boosting revenue through legislative 
proposals to raise $5.8 billion.
    Let me talk about revenues. In 2008, the Department of the 
Interior, on offshore alone, made about $18 billion a year. 
Last year, we made $2.6 billion. We had a drop of $15.5 billion 
a year on revenue. Some of it was the gas and oil prices, but 
not all of it. When you add timber, when you add onshore, the 
picture gets worse.
    So, when we talk about $11.5 billion behind on 
infrastructure in our parks, which represents 73 percent of 
infrastructure in the Department, on scale, we would have made 
up our entire backlog plus $3 billion of additional investment 
to fund programs, schools, and honor our Indian trust in 1 
year. That is the scale of what occurred.
    There are two sides of every balance sheet: there are the 
revenues and the expenses. As a Secretary, I immediately signed 
a Secretarial Order to look at revenues across the board. I re-
established the Committee on Revenues. And revenues, we are 
looking at every enterprise that operates on public land, 
whether it is wind, gas, oil, coal, across the board, because I 
want to make sure that the American public's interest is met. 
If you are going to operate on public land, then the 
stakeholder is us, the public. I want to make sure that our 
rules and regulations are not arbitrary, trust but verify, and 
the American public interest is served.
    When it comes to infrastructure, we plan to take care of 
what we have first. So, yes, the LWCF program, which I have 
always supported, what has dropped is additional land 
acquisition. It does not prevent such things as conservation 
easement programs, but more land has dropped from the budget as 
it sits today. It is a starting point.
    And I have always supported LWCF, but over the course of 
time LWCF is funded through offshore assets. So, when offshore 
assets, oil and gas, go to the bottom, so does the fund. But 
having said that, over the course of time there is $20 billion 
of unappropriated funds in LWCF. Was that the intent?
    Even though every year money comes in, whether this gets 
appropriated or not is a congressional issue. Same as, and it 
is worse, over in Reclamation. There is about $20 billion in 
Reclamation that has not been tasked either. Those funds were 
for one thing, to build our water, our rural, and projects, so 
there is an appropriation issue, as well, that we will address.
    The budget calls for a $35 million increase, for a total of 
$766 million for national parks infrastructure. And if you want 
to look at our infrastructure of the national parks, I invite 
you to look at Arlington. It is a national disgrace. And it 
just didn't happen in the last 8 years. But our Park Service, 
our assets, deferred maintenance has been a problem. But if you 
want to look, go to Arlington. The shutters are falling off, 
the garden grounds are unacceptable. The building itself is in 
ruin. And that is hallowed ground, and it is not very far from 
here.
    We fully fund fire suppression. This Committee has talked 
about it year after year after year of why we have to spend 
billions of dollars every year fighting forest fires. The 
Forest Service, which is not part of the Department of the 
Interior, has 71 million acres of dead and dying timber. It 
will not happen on BLM land. So, we have purposely funded fire 
suppression to get the dead and dying timber off our public 
lands so we don't have to fight the forest fires.
    We found savings in Federal land acquisitions. I talked 
about eliminating some programs and allowing states and local 
communities in private partnership to take a bigger play. At 
the end of the day, we made tough decisions.
    Payment in Lieu of Taxes, for the first time in a long 
time, we put $397 million in Payment in Lieu of Taxes. Last 
year, there was zero. So, we put it in the discretionary side 
as a marker. I don't know what is going to happen on the SRS 
side, but on PILT, that is $397 million plus-up from last 
budget. Although it doesn't fully fund it, it is a plus-up from 
last budget.
    So, yes, this is a starting point. But I want everyone to 
realize this is a starting point of a balanced budget. And 
there are fundamental differences on what programs should get 
funded, and this is why we are here. I look forward to working 
with you, I look forward to working on both sides. I know you, 
personally.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;      Prepared Statement of Ryan Zinke, Secretary of the Interior
    Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and members of the 
Committee, I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss the 2018 
President's Budget for the Department of the Interior, which provides 
$11.7 billion for Interior's programs, with an additional $123.9 
million of discretionary Department of Defense appropriations requested 
to be transferred to the Department of the Interior to support 
enactment of the 2010 Compact Review Agreement with Palau.
    Because of the timing between enactment of the Fiscal Year 2017 
Omnibus Appropriations Act and submission of the Fiscal Year 2018 
President's Budget, my statement compares requested funding to the 
Fiscal Year 2017 Annualized Continuing Resolution unless otherwise 
noted.
                         2018 budget priorities
    The 2018 budget for the Department of the Interior features 
targeted investments to further the Administration's America First 
national energy goals. At the same time, this budget reflects the 
President's commitment to fiscal responsibility--proposing sensible and 
rational reductions and making hard choices to reach a balanced budget 
by 2027.
    Across Interior's diverse mission, this budget emphasizes the 
Department's crucial role in promoting economic growth. America's lands 
hold tremendous job-creating assets. Visitors to our parks spend more 
than $18.4 billion in local gateway communities, supporting 
approximately 318,000 jobs and contributing $34.9 billion into the 
national economy according to the 2016 National Park Service Visitor 
Spending Effects Report.
    In 2016, the Department's energy, mineral, grazing, and forestry 
activities resulted in $8.8 billion in revenue to the American people, 
including direct revenue payments to states, tribes, and local 
communities. These same activities supported $136 billion in economic 
output. The Budget for the Bureau of Reclamation invests over $1 
billion in safe, reliable, and efficient management of water resources 
throughout the western United States. In addition, direct grants and 
payments to states, tribes, and local communities provided an estimated 
$10 billion in economic output.
    The Department's 2018 budget reflects the Administration's 
commitment to strengthen America's economic and energy security, focus 
on the Nation's infrastructure, be responsible stewards of magnificent 
lands, encourage public access for outdoor recreation, and strengthen 
tribal sovereignty and support self-determination.
                            america's energy
    The Department is the steward and manager of America's natural 
resources, including oil, gas, coal, hydropower, minerals, and 
renewable energy sources. The Department has a critical role to play in 
the future energy security of our Nation as well as our overall 
economic well-being. American energy resources create jobs and generate 
significant revenue both to the U.S. Treasury and states. This budget 
proposes $791.2 million in current and permanent funding for energy 
related programs across the Department, an increase of $16.3 million 
from 2017. The 2018 budget supports an ``all-of-the-above'' energy 
development strategy, increasing funding for onshore and offshore oil 
and gas, strengthening coal management activities, and sustaining the 
current pace of renewable energy development.
    The budget reflects the importance of offshore energy production to 
America's economic and energy security. The 2018 budget shores up 
offshore oil and gas programs with appropriated funding to continue a 
strong offshore program. The request for the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management features a $10.2 million increase to update the Five-Year 
Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, consistent with 
the President's Executive Order Implementing an America-First Offshore 
Energy Strategy to expand offshore oil and gas exploration and 
production. The 2018 budget for the Bureau of Safety and Environmental 
Enforcement includes a $1.2 million increase to focus on workforce 
training, permitting, and information technologies to better permit 
exploration, development, and production operations.
    Onshore, the budget requests a $16.0 million increase for the 
Bureau of Land Management's oil and gas management program, providing a 
total of $75.9 million in appropriated funds focused on improving oil 
and gas permit application processing, streamlining leasing, and 
modernizing practices. The budget also includes $19.0 million for the 
BLM coal management program, an $8.0 million increase to reduce 
administrative processing times, simplify the lease application 
process, and improve the timeliness to complete lease sale fair market 
value determinations.
    The 2018 budget includes $78.1 million for Renewable Energy 
programs both on and offshore. Although a reduction from prior years, 
this funding level will sustain the current pace of development at a 
level consistent with anticipated project interest.
    To ensure the public continues to receive the full value of natural 
resources production on Federal lands, in April, I signed a charter 
establishing a Royalty Policy Committee of 28 local, tribal, state, and 
other stakeholders to advise me on the fair market value of and revenue 
collection from Federal and Indian mineral and energy leases, including 
renewable energy sources.
                      the nation's infrastructure
    Interior plays an important role in maintaining and improving the 
Nation's infrastructure. Interior's national role includes managing 
significant real property assets as well as conducting reviews and 
processing permits to support national infrastructure development as 
part of a balanced multiple land use strategy.
    Interior's 2018 budget maintains the 2017 level of $98.8 million 
for Fish and Wildlife Service planning and consultation activities. 
This level maintains the FWS capability to meet its legal consultation 
requirements and avoid logjams that could delay infrastructure projects 
and associated economic benefits. The BLM budget also directs base 
funding to address siting for energy transmission projects, and 
proposes an increase in the oil and gas management program to 
facilitate rights-of-way associated with energy development projects.
    Interior manages an infrastructure asset portfolio with a 
replacement value exceeding $300 billion, ranging from elementary and 
secondary schools serving Indian children, to highways and bridges 
serving the daily commuting needs of the Washington, DC, metropolitan 
area. Interior owns approximately 43,000 buildings, 100,000 miles of 
road, and 80,000 structures--including iconic landmarks, as well as 
dams, bridges, laboratories, employee housing, and irrigation and power 
infrastructure. Taking care of this significant asset portfolio is a 
persistent challenge. Interior's deferred maintenance backlog has grown 
to over $15 billion in 2016. Construction and maintenance funding 
across the Department totals $1.4 billion in 2018, not including the 
Bureau of Reclamation.
    From my first day on the job, one of my top priorities has been to 
prioritize efforts to address the National Park Service maintenance 
backlog. Our National Parks have 73 percent of Interior's deferred 
maintenance backlog while hosting 324 million visitors last year. The 
2018 budget for NPS includes $236.3 million for construction and 
deferred maintenance projects, an increase of $21.0 million from 2017. 
Total estimated funding for NPS maintenance and construction needs 
including estimated recreation fee revenue is $765.7 million, an 
increase of $34.7 million from Fiscal Year 2017. This increase will 
support targeted and measurable upgrades to a number of the NPS' 
highest priority assets, including the first phase of repairs to the 
Arlington Memorial Bridge project.
                            america's lands
    In my first days in office, I issued two Secretarial Orders to 
expand access to public lands and increase hunting, fishing, and 
recreation opportunities nationwide. The 2018 budget includes $4.4 
billion for the Department's land management operations in the NPS, 
FWS, and the BLM. While a reduction of $354.3 million from 2017, this 
figure includes funding for operational programs as well as management 
and maintenance of the national parks, national wildlife refuges, and 
BLM's network of national conservation lands. Within land management 
operations, the budget prioritizes funding to protect and conserve 
America's public lands and natural resources, provide access to public 
lands for the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts, and ensure 
visitor safety.
    To support land management priorities, funding for lower priority 
activities, such as Federal land acquisition projects, is reduced. The 
2018 budget emphasizes taking care of our current assets, rather than 
adding more by purchasing new land. Accordingly, the budget for land 
acquisition programs is $54.0 million, $129.1 million below 2017. A 
small amount of funding is maintained in each bureau for emergencies or 
acquisition of inholdings needed to improve management of established 
areas or to increase public access.
    To better manage and balance these responsibilities, the Department 
relies on its front-line land managers, field scientists, and partners 
to monitor, assess, and collect information about the status of 
resource conditions. Interior's U.S. Geological Survey is the Nation's 
leading source of expertise in earth and natural sciences and works 
closely with other Departmental bureaus and state, local, tribal and 
other Federal partners to help resource managers adapt to changing 
conditions on the ground. The 2018 budget includes $922.2 million for 
USGS programs, to focus on core science activities including land and 
water resources, energy and minerals, mapping, ecosystems, invasive 
species, natural hazards, and environmental health.
    The 2018 request budgets responsibly for the Payments in Lieu of 
Taxes program. The budget includes $397 million for these payments as 
part of the discretionary request, to ensure continued support to the 
communities neighboring the Department's and other Federal lands 
without assuming enactment of separate legislation. The 2018 level for 
PILT is reduced 12 percent below the 2017 CR level, consistent with the 
total reduction in the Interior budget.
    A key component of the Department's land stewardship is management 
of wildland fire. The 2018 budget provides $389.4 million for wildfire 
suppression--the full 10-year average of suppression expenditures. This 
level of funding is projected to be sufficient to meet fire suppression 
needs in an average fire season without the risk of needing emergency 
transfers from other departmental accounts.
                            america's waters
    The 2018 budget also continues efforts to address the challenges of 
water availability and drought conditions.
    The Department, primarily through the Bureau of Reclamation, works 
with states, tribes, local governments, and non-governmental 
organizations to pursue a sustainable water supply for the West by 
providing Federal leadership and assistance on the efficient use of 
water. The 2018 budget continues these efforts to address the 
challenges of water availability.
    Interior's $1.1 billion budget request for Reclamation invests in 
our water and power infrastructure, facilitating the delivery of water 
to 31 million people across the West. It is the Nation's largest 
renewable energy resource, and the Bureau of Reclamation plays an 
important role as the second largest producer of hydropower in the 
United States.
    This budget also continues to strengthen our Tribal Nations by 
implementing Indian water rights settlements, and focuses on the 
protection and restoration of aquatic and riparian environments to 
ensure we can continue to provide a reliable water supply and power to 
the West.
                    america's trust responsibilities
    Interior maintains strong and important relationships with Native 
and insular communities, helping to promote efficient and effective 
governance and to support nation-building and self-determination. The 
Department provides services directly, or through contracts, grants or 
compacts, to 567 federally recognized tribes with a service population 
of nearly 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. The budget 
prioritizes support for programs serving the broadest service 
population and proposes reductions in initiatives that are more 
narrowly focused. The President's budget maintains the Administration's 
strong support for the principle of tribal self-determination, and 
efforts to strengthen tribal communities across Indian Country. The 
budget includes full funding for Contract Support Costs and Tribal 
Grant Support Costs that tribes incur from managing Federal Indian 
programs.
    The 2018 budget request includes $786.4 million to continue support 
for core Indian education programs, including formula funding and 
operation and maintenance funding for elementary and secondary schools, 
and support for post-secondary programs. The 2018 budget continues to 
meet Federal responsibilities outlined in enacted land and water rights 
claim settlements with Indian tribes, and includes $160.8 million for 
authorized settlements and technical and legal support involving tribal 
water rights, to maintain the Department's ability to complete these 
settlement requirements within the statutory time frames.
    In recognition of the importance of the Nation's relationship with 
Palau and the Pacific national security strategy, the budget requests 
$123.9 million of discretionary Department of Defense appropriations to 
be transferred to the Department of the Interior to support enactment 
of the 2010 Compact Review Agreement with Palau.
                         management and reform
    As part of the President's March 2017, Executive Order on a 
Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the executive branch, the 
Administration launched a government-wide effort to create a leaner, 
more efficient, and more responsive government. The Order directs 
agencies to begin planning to operate at the funding levels in the 2018 
budget and develop a broader Agency Reform Plan to address long-term 
workforce reductions. Interior is moving prudently with implementation 
and has put in place hiring controls to enable limited hiring, 
prioritizing filling field positions rather than office positions, and 
limiting hires in the Washington, DC, and Denver, Colorado, areas. This 
process enables the Department to continue to fill important positions 
as work is underway to develop a comprehensive and thoughtful agency 
plan.
    The 2018 budget reduces lower priority programs $1.6 billion below 
2017 and supports 59,968 full time equivalents. This represents an 
estimated reduction of roughly 4,000 full time equivalent staff from 
2017. To accomplish this, the Department will rely on a combination of 
attrition, reassignments, and separation incentives. Actual attrition 
rates and acceptance of separation incentives will determine the need 
for further action to reduce staffing.
    Reducing the Department's physical footprint and seeking ways to 
consolidate space and resources will continue to be management 
objectives going forward. Efforts will build on several multi-year 
actions to reduce Interior's nationwide facilities footprint and 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its information technology 
infrastructure and financial reporting capabilities. Ensuring the 
Department's cybersecurity strength continues to be a priority. The 
2018 budget maintains $10.0 million in the appropriated working capital 
fund to continue the Department's remediation of its cybersecurity 
systems and processes.
                           bureau highlights
    Bureau of Land Management--The 2018 request for the BLM is $1.1 
billion, a decrease of $162.7 million below the 2017 CR level and 
$180.5 million below the 2017 enacted level. The budget proposes $963.2 
million for Management of Lands and Resources and $89.8 million for 
Oregon and California Grant Lands, BLM's two primary operational 
appropriation accounts.
    The BLM request features increases in oil, gas and coal management 
programs reflecting national energy security priorities. The budget 
proposes $75.9 million for Oil and Gas Management to support permitting 
and rights-of-way processing, streamline leasing, and modernize 
practices. The budget also includes $19.0 million to strengthen BLM's 
Coal Management program, an increase of $8.0 million from 2017.
    To maintain the BLM's land stewardship responsibilities, the budget 
includes $67.8 million for Rangeland Management and $70.7 million for 
the Wild Horse and Burro Management program. As part of a broader 
effort to consider all necessary options to manage the unsustainable 
growth of this program, the budget proposes to eliminate current 
appropriations language restricting the BLM's ability to use the tools 
provided in the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act and enable 
BLM to manage on-range herds more effectively and humanely. The budget 
also proposes $47.2 million for Recreation Resources Management and 
$27.7 million to continue support for the National Conservation Land 
areas.
    The budget includes $89.8 million for the Oregon and California 
Grant Lands programs. At this level, the budget prioritizes offering 
the allowable sale quantity in new resource management plans.
    Mineral development on Federal lands is important to the national 
economy. However, a long-standing challenge is to provide a fair return 
to taxpayers for the use of these natural resources without 
discouraging development. To meet this challenge, the Department will 
conduct a study starting in 2017 to evaluate the production and 
development of hardrock minerals from Federal lands. The review will 
include an analysis of revenue recovered by other entities, including 
other countries, which permit mining on their land. The Department will 
also consult with other appropriate agencies, such as the Department of 
Agriculture. The findings will be considered as part of ongoing efforts 
to improve agency management and streamline permitting related to 
natural resources produced from Federal lands.
    Bureau of Ocean Energy Management--The 2018 President's budget for 
BOEM is $171.0 million, slightly above the 2017 CR level, including 
$114.2 million in current appropriations and $56.8 million in 
offsetting collections from rental receipts and cost recoveries. The 
budget maintains a level program by increasing appropriated funding by 
$35.5 million to address a commensurate shortfall in estimated 
offsetting rental receipts and cost recoveries. The 2018 budget 
features a $10.2 million increase to support the development of a new 
Five-Year Plan for the OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program.
    Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement--The 2018 
President's budget request for BSEE is $204.9 million, slightly above 
the 2017 CR level, including $112.0 million in current appropriations 
and $92.9 million in offsetting collections from rental receipts, cost 
recoveries, and inspection fees. The budget maintains a strong offshore 
safety and environmental enforcement program by increasing 
appropriations and estimated inspection fee revenue to address 
anticipated shortfalls in offsetting rental receipts and other cost 
recoveries. The 2018 budget includes a $1.2 million increase for 
technical training to expand staff development efforts for BSEE's 
inspector, engineer, and geoscientist workforce, and $12.7 million for 
oil spill research, a reduction of $2.2 million from 2017.
    Bureau of Reclamation--The 2018 budget request for the Bureau of 
Reclamation is $1.1 billion in discretionary appropriations. This 
figure reflects a decrease of 13.1 percent from the 2017 CR level. Of 
the total, $960 million is for the Water and Related Resources account, 
Reclamation's largest account; $59 million is for the Policy and 
Administration account; $37 million is for the California Bay Delta 
Restoration account; and $41.4 million is for the Central Valley 
Project Restoration Fund.
    Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement--The 2018 
budget request for OSMRE is $129.4 million in current appropriations, 
$110.7 million below the 2017 CR level. The majority of this reduction 
reflects the elimination of $89.9 million for Abandoned Mine Lands 
Economic Development Grants. Although beneficial, funding for this 
pilot program overlaps with existing mandatory Abandoned Mine Lands 
grants which continue without any proposed changes. The budget includes 
$60.2 million for state and tribal regulatory grants, a level 
consistent with anticipated state and tribal program obligations.
    U.S. Geological Survey--The 2018 budget request for the USGS is 
$922.2 million, $137.8 million below the 2017 CR level. The budget 
includes $70.9 million for satellite operations, which supports 
continued development of the Landsat 9 ground systems, supporting a 
launch date in early Fiscal Year 2021 to replace the Landsat 7 
satellite, which is reaching the end of its usable life.
    The request emphasizes energy and mineral development, supporting 
essential hazards monitoring, and providing scientific information to 
support decision making by resource managers and policy makers. The 
budget maintains support for nationwide networks of more than 8,000 
streamgages and nearly 3,000 earthquake sensors. The request provides 
$17.3 million for nationwide efforts to counter invasive species and 
wildlife diseases such as white-nose syndrome and highly pathogenic 
avian influenza, and the budget maintains $17.3 million for 40 
cooperative research units that support state-specific needs, 
particularly related to fish and game species. It continues acquisition 
of modern elevation data for Alaska and the 3-year cycle of topographic 
map updates for the contiguous United States.
    The 2018 request proposes to realign the 2018 budget structure to 
create a new Land Resources activity to reflect focused science related 
to on-the-ground land management and adaptive management challenges. As 
part of this request, the budget proposes $17.4 million for the 
National and Regional Climate Adaptation Science Centers, reflecting 
the proposed consolidation of eight regional centers to four.
    Fish and Wildlife Service--The 2018 President's budget requests 
$1.3 billion for FWS programs, a decrease of $202.9 million from the 
2017 CR level. The budget includes $1.2 billion for FWS operations, a 
decrease of $85.3 million below 2017. Within Resource Management, the 
budget prioritizes funding to maintain operations and maintenance for 
the National Wildlife Refuge System ($470.1 million) and the National 
Fish Hatchery System ($51.9 million). Funding will continue operations 
for all refuge areas and hatchery sites.
    The budget includes $225.2 million for Ecological Services programs 
with an emphasis on species recovery and planning consultation 
activities. Consistent with efforts to focus adaptive management 
related science within the USGS, the request proposes to eliminate 
funding for Science Support at $17.0 million and Landscape Conservation 
Cooperatives at $13.0 million.
    The budget is $118.6 million for FWS conservation grants including 
$52.8 million for State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, $33.6 million for 
the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund, $19.3 million for the 
Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, $9.0 million for the 
Multinational Species Conservation Fund, and $3.9 million for 
Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation. Consistent with decreases in 
other land acquisition programs across the Department, the request 
proposes to eliminate funding for Cooperative Endangered Species 
Conservation Fund land acquisition grants.
    National Park Service--The 2018 President's budget request for NPS 
is $2.6 billion, $296.6 million below the 2017 CR level.
    The budget proposes $2.2 billion for NPS operations. Within this 
account, funding is prioritized for the care and maintenance of 
existing resources. The budget includes $99.3 million for repair and 
rehabilitation projects, which addresses the deferred maintenance 
backlog, as well as $112.7 million for cyclic maintenance projects, 
which ensures maintenance is conducted in a timely fashion to avoid 
increasing the deferred maintenance backlog.
    The budget proposes $226.5 million for Construction projects, an 
increase of $34.0 million to help address deferred maintenance and 
allow for targeted and measurable upgrades to a number of the NPS's 
highest priority assets. Within this request is $18.2 million for phase 
one construction requirements for the Arlington Memorial Bridge. Also 
included in the request is $15.0 million in appropriated funds for the 
Centennial Challenge program to provide the Federal match to leverage 
partner donations for signature projects and programs. An additional 
$15.0 million from fee revenue is also anticipated for 2018 to support 
Centennial projects.
    The request provides $37.0 million for National Recreation and 
Preservation programs to support local community efforts to preserve 
natural and cultural resources. The budget assumes savings of $18.8 
million from the proposed elimination of payments to National Heritage 
Areas. The 2018 budget includes $51.1 million for the Historic 
Preservation Fund core grants-in-aid programs. The budget proposes to 
shift support for Land and Water Conservation Fund State Grants from 
appropriated to mandatory funding comparable to an estimated $90 
million the program will receive from oil and gas activities from 
certain Gulf of Mexico offshore leases.
    Indian Affairs--The 2018 President's budget request for Indian 
Affairs is $2.5 billion, $303.3 million below the 2017 CR level. 
Funding for Operation of Indian Programs totals $2.1 billion, a 
decrease of $181.1 million below 2017. In 2018, priority is given to 
programs serving the broadest audience rather than initiatives or 
pilots. Within this total is $786.4 million for Bureau of Indian 
Education programs where funding focuses on direct school operations 
and full funding for Tribal Grant Support Costs. The main operating 
account also includes $349.3 million for Public Safety and Justice 
programs and $277.5 million for Trust Services programs, which includes 
the elimination of the Tribal Climate Resilience program.
    The budget fully funds Contract Support Costs at $241.6 million, 
$35.4 million below 2017, which will cover all anticipated requirements 
at the requested program funding level. The budget requests $143.3 
million for Construction programs. The 2018 budget prioritizes dams, 
irrigation projects, and irrigation systems which deliver water to aid 
economic development as well as protect lives, resources, and property. 
The budget prioritizes funding within education construction for 
operations and maintenance of existing facilities. The budget also 
includes $14.0 million to provide payments to ongoing Indian Land and 
Water settlements and $6.7 million for the Indian Guaranteed Loan 
Program.
Departmental Offices
    Office of the Secretary--The 2018 budget request for Departmental 
Operations is $123.9 million, $596.5 million below the 2017 CR. The 
majority of this reduction is $451.1 million associated with the shift 
of the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program which was appropriated within 
Departmental Operations in 2017. In 2018, the budget proposes to fund 
PILT as discretionary funding within Department-wide Programs. The 
budget also reflects the proposed transfer of $140.3 million associated 
with the Office of Natural Resources Revenue to a new appropriation 
within Department-wide Programs. The proposed transfer of ONRR funding 
will increase transparency in the budget for the Department's energy 
revenue programs. The 2018 request for remaining Office of Secretary 
programs reflects a reduction of $4.0 million from central program 
management activities across the Office of the Secretary organization. 
Of this, $2.6 million is associated with reductions to the Office of 
Valuation Services consistent with the proposed Department-wide 
decrease for new land acquisition.
    Office of Insular Affairs--The 2018 OIA budget request is $84.3 
million, $19.0 million below the 2017 CR. In addition, the majority of 
OIA's budget proposal reflects a request to fully fund the renegotiated 
Compact with Palau by transferring $123.9 million from the Department 
of Defense, rather than $13.1 million in extended incremental annual 
payments. The Compact is an important element of the Pacific national 
security strategy.
    Office of the Solicitor--The 2018 budget proposes $65.7 million for 
the Office of the Solicitor, the same as the 2017 CR level, to provide 
legal counsel, administer the Department's ethics program, and help 
resolve legal issues among bureaus and offices as they fulfill their 
duties.
    Office of Inspector General--The 2018 budget proposes $50.0 million 
for the Office of Inspector General, the same as the 2017 CR level, to 
continue support for audit and investigations across the Department.
    Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians--The 2018 budget 
requests $119.4 million for OST, $19.4 million below the 2017 CR level. 
The budget proposes a $3.7 million reduction below 2017 in Field 
Operations reflecting prioritization of services to continue operations 
at the beneficiary call center. A reduction of $3.1 million is proposed 
within Historical Trust Accounting in expectation of reduced 
requirements. Smaller additional reductions are taken across the 
organization.
Department-wide Programs
    Payments in Lieu of Taxes--The 2018 budget proposes $396.9 million 
in discretionary funding for PILT, a decrease of $54.3 million from the 
comparable 2017 CR level of $451.1 million appropriated in Departmental 
Operations in 2016. This is a reduction of 12 percent, commensurate 
with the Department of the Interior's overall reduction from 2017 CR 
budget levels.
    Office of Natural Resources Revenue--The 2018 budget request 
includes $137.8 million for ONRR's receipts management programs, a 
decrease of $2.5 million below the comparable 2017 CR level of $140.3 
million. The 2018 budget request proposes to transfer ONRR's receipts 
management program from the Office of the Secretary's Departmental 
Operations account to a separate appropriation within Department-wide 
Programs to increase transparency of the program. The request includes 
$3.5 million for anticipated contract cost increases for the Minerals 
Revenue Management Support System.
    Central Hazardous Materials Fund--The 2018 budget requests $2.0 
million for the Central Hazardous Materials Fund, $8.0 million below 
the 2017 CR. The budget request funds program management and legal 
staff. The program will fund the highest priority remediation projects 
based on the availability of recoveries and focus resources on 
remediation projects with potentially responsible parties.
    Wildland Fire Management--The 2018 budget request for the Wildland 
Fire Management Program is $873.5 million. The total request represents 
a decrease of $118.3 million from the 2017 CR level for the Wildland 
Fire Management and FLAME accounts. At this level the request provides 
$389.4 million for Suppression Operations to fully fund the 10-year 
average. To streamline financial management processes and improve the 
efficiency in allocating suppression funding, the Department proposes 
to fund all suppression activities in the Wildland Fire Management 
account and eliminate the separate FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve 
Fund account once all current balances in the FLAME account are drawn 
down. The request also includes $322.2 million for Preparedness 
activities, essentially level with 2017, and $149.5 million for Fuels 
Management, $20.2 million below 2017.
    Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration--The 2018 
request for NRDAR is $4.6 million, a decrease of $3.2 million below the 
2017 CR level. The budget includes funding needed for ongoing damage 
assessments and restoration activities.
    Working Capital Fund--The 2018 budget proposes $59.5 million for 
the appropriated portion of the Department's Working Capital Fund, a 
decrease of $7.5 million from the 2017 CR level. The reduction is from 
funds requested for the Financial and Business Management System which 
is proposed at $46.3 million. The request maintains $10.0 million for 
Department-wide Cybersecurity needs.
                         legislative proposals
    Bureau of Reclamation Title Transfer--The Administration is 
developing a proposal to better facilitate title transfer of 
Reclamation facilities to non-Federal entities when such transfers are 
beneficial to all parties. This proposal will allow local water 
managers to make their own decisions to improve water management at the 
local level, while allowing Reclamation to focus management efforts on 
projects with a greater Federal nexus.
    Cancel Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act Account 
Balances--The budget proposes legislation to cancel $230.0 million in 
unobligated balances from the Southern Nevada Public Land Management 
Act program over a 3-year period. This would redirect a portion of the 
program balances to the Treasury for broader taxpayer use. The SNPLMA 
program is not proposed for elimination and viable conservation efforts 
will continue to be supported.
    Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act Payments--The Administration 
proposes to repeal revenue sharing payments to four coastal states--
Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas--and their local 
governments, which are currently set to expand substantially starting 
in 2018. This proposal will ensure the sale of public resources from 
Federal waters owned by all Americans, benefits all Americans. 
Mandatory funding for LWCF State Grants would continue, but this 
legislative proposal would replace GOMESA's complicated allocation 
formula with a fixed annual appropriation of a comparable dollar 
amount, starting at $90.0 million in 2018 and increasing to $125.0 
million in 2022 and remaining at $125.0 million each year thereafter.
    Land and Water Conservation Fund--The LWCF receipts authorization 
expires at the end of Fiscal Year 2018 and the Administration will 
review options for reauthorization, including consideration of a range 
of conservation-related investments that could be funded through the 
LWCF.
    Oil and Gas Leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--The 
Administration will propose legislation to allow oil and gas leasing in 
the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge also known as 
the ``1002 area.'' The budget assumes lease sales would begin in 2022 
or 2023, allowing adequate time for the completion of appropriate 
environmental reviews and an updated assessment of the state of the oil 
and gas market and lease bidding potential prior to scheduling specific 
lease sales. An additional lease sale or sales would be held in 2026 or 
2027. Lease sales in the ANWR are estimated to generate $3.5 billion in 
bonus bids to be split between the U.S. Treasury and the state of 
Alaska. The proposal is estimated to generate a net of $1.8 billion in 
new revenue to the Treasury over 10 years.
    Reauthorize the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act--The 
budget assumes permanent reauthorization of FLTFA's land sale 
authority, allowing Interior to dispose of lands with low conservation 
value and use the proceeds to acquire lands with higher conservation 
values, consistent with the original FLTFA mandate.
    Recreation Fee Program--The budget proposes to permanently 
reauthorize the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, which 
currently expires in September 2018. As a precaution, appropriations 
language is also submitted with the budget proposing a 1-year extension 
through September 2019. The revenues collected by Interior from these 
recreation fees--nearly $290 million annually--are an important source 
of funding for land management operations, maintenance, and 
improvements to recreation facilities on public lands.
    Termination of EPAct Geothermal Payments to Counties--The budget 
proposes to restore Federal geothermal leasing revenue allocations to 
the historical formula of 50 percent to the states and 50 percent to 
the U.S. Treasury by repealing Section 224(b) of the Energy Policy Act 
of 2005.
                    offsetting collections and fees
    Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement Offshore Inspection 
Fees--The budget includes appropriations language to amend the current 
fee structure for BSEE inspection fees to better align with BSEE's 
inspection practices and program costs. The language structures fees 
charged for the inspection of offshore facilities to distinguish 
between those ``without processing equipment'' or ``with processing 
equipment'' and incorporate consideration of the number of wells and 
water depth. These changes to the fee structure are estimated to 
generate $65.0 million in 2018.
    National Wildlife Refuge Damage Cost Recovery--The budget includes 
appropriations language to authorize the FWS to retain recoveries from 
responsible parties to restore or replace damages they cause. This is 
similar to authorities provided to the NPS for damages to national 
parks and monuments.
                               conclusion
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the President's 2018 
budget request for the Department of the Interior.
    In closing, this is a responsible budget to help balance the 
Federal budget by 2027. It maintains core functions important to the 
American people, including providing the public the unique American 
experience that comes from visiting our parks, refuges, and public 
lands. It reflects tough choices to prioritize and focus limited 
resources where investments have the most impact, but continues to 
deliver access and services which are critical to Americans. I thank 
you again for your continued support of the Department's mission. I 
look forward to answering questions about this budget. This concludes 
my written statement.
                                 ______
 Questions Submitted for the Record to the Hon. Ryan Zinke, Secretary, 
                    U.S. Department of the Interior
                 Questions Submitted by Rep. McClintock
    Question 1. There are some 150 conservation corps across the 
Nation. These corps have a long tradition of stewardship of our public 
lands and waters. By partnering with corps, land managers leverage 
their budgets with cost-effective projects that reduce the multi-
billion-dollar maintenance backlog, remediate wildfires, curb the 
spread of invasive species, improve access to public lands, build and 
maintain trails, and ensure good fish and wildlife habitat for 
enthusiasts, hunters, and anglers.
  --  Are you aware of any impediments that have limited growth of this 
            program?
    Answer. Interior bureaus have a long history of collaborating with 
a wide variety of volunteer groups, education partners and youth 
organizations including conservation corps. These partnerships assist 
land managers in maintaining resources in a cost effective manner while 
providing participants with developmental jobs skills training and 
education. Not all of the work done by land management agencies can be 
done by conservation corps, but we are not aware of any impediments to 
using these partnerships, to the extent that our resources permit, 
where it is appropriate to do so.
    Question 2. After years of talking and concerted efforts by 
telecommunications companies and concessioners, too many front country 
areas of our national parks and too many key road corridors in our 
parks still offer no cellular or WiFi connectivity. There are safety 
issues and lost opportunities to boost park experiences with helpful 
visitor information.
  --  Does the FY 2018 budget envision additional WiFi connectivity 
            requests for proposals?
  --  Will this be one of your priorities as Secretary?
    Answer. Yes, one of my top priorities is to expand recreational 
access to public lands and waters, and connectivity is one way to 
achieve this goal. As I have previously remarked, in parks, we're the 
old generation; the young generation appreciates connectivity and we 
should embrace that to make sure the park experience going down a trail 
is available on your phone. We will look to build public-private 
partnerships to make our outdoor recreation experience even better.
    Question 3. Across the National Park System stays are down. RV 
overnights in national park campgrounds are down more than 2 million, 
or almost 50 percent, at a time when the RV market is booming. Recently 
while speaking to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association you 
stated, ``As the secretary, I don't want to be in the business of 
running campgrounds.''
  --  Does the FY 2018 budget include a major push to improve and 
            transfer campground operations?
    Answer. This budget is focused on leveraging public-private 
partnerships in order to improve visitor experiences on public lands 
and waters, while also helping to reduce the Department's maintenance 
backlog. The Park Service has a long history of working with our 
partners and concessioners to create positive experiences for visitors. 
We look to improve and build upon that cooperation.
    Question 4. Mr. Secretary, you have previously stated that one of 
your top priorities as Secretary was to increase employee morale and 
ensure that employees on the front lines have the right tools, 
resources, and flexibility to make the decisions to get their jobs 
done. According to the 2016 Best Places to Work in the Federal 
Government rankings compiled by the Partnership for Public Service and 
based on OPM's annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, employee 
engagement at DOI has been improving since 2015. However, several of 
the agency's components continue to rank low in their employee 
engagement, including the Bureaus of Land Management, Indian Affairs 
and the Park Service.
  --  What are you doing to hold leadership across the Department 
            accountable for engaging employees? How can this Committee 
            help?
    Answer. As I said at the hearing, we are looking at how to better 
leverage and align bureau resources in the field, cut duplication, and 
push assets and personnel where they should be. Accountability from 
managers, for employee actions and program performance, will be an 
important component as we move forward. We are reviewing a number of 
comments on reform that we have received from the public and we expect 
to include some proposals with the FY 2019 budget request.
    Question 5. Within the Department of the Interior, agencies like 
the National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Fish and 
Wildlife Service frequently interact with citizens in their day-to-day 
operations. As part of their 2015 cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, 
agencies should be working to ensure the delivery of smarter, better 
and faster service to their citizens.
  --  What steps are Department and agency leaders taking to meet their 
            customer service CAP goals?
  --  What is the agency doing to collect feedback from customers to 
            improve its service to citizens?
  --  How is the Department incorporating citizens' experience into its 
            reform plan due to OMB on June 30?
    Answer. I have said before that it is my belief that more 
meaningful involvement and cooperation with communities closest to our 
public lands will result in innovative ideas and practices as well as 
better stewardship of the land and its resources. We are in the process 
of updating the Department's strategic plan and, as part of this 
process, are reviewing goals, objectives, and key performance 
indicators to best reflect our team's priorities and main activities as 
we look forward to the next 5 years. The Department's Annual 
Performance Plan and Report for FY 2017-FY 2018 was released on May 26, 
2017, www.doi.gov/bpp, and describes in some detail the agency's 
priority goals.
    Question 6. The government reorganization Executive Order and 
subsequent OMB guidance attempt to align government reform efforts with 
the Federal budget and performance planning processes. In response, 
agencies are developing high-level reform and workforce reduction plans 
outlining proposals to reduce duplication, increase efficiency and 
maximize employee performance.
  --  What are you doing as Secretary to lead reform and reshaping 
            efforts within the Department?
  --  What actions will the Department take to reduce duplication in 
            its operations, increase the effectiveness and efficiency 
            of its services and maximize the performance of its staff?
    Answer. As I said at the hearing, we are looking at how to better 
leverage and align bureau resources in the field, cut duplication, and 
push assets and personnel where they should be. We are reviewing a 
number of comments on reform that we have received from the public and 
we expect to include some proposals with the FY 2019 budget request.
    Question 7. Just 14 percent of the DOI workforce falls under age 
34, but 48 percent of the workforce is over 50. Filling positions in 
remote locations and retaining employees are difficult issues for the 
Department and, in particular, for organizations like the National Park 
Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Bureau of Land Management.
  --  What barriers does the Department face in reaching and utilizing 
            entry-level talent to fill these key positions?
  --  What steps is the Department taking to better attract, recruit, 
            and retain the next generation of public servants to solve 
            the Department's complex challenges?
    Answer. Recent Government Accountability Office studies have 
reported on the challenges that the Department and its bureaus have 
faced in recruiting and retaining staff. It is important that we have 
an effective workforce, particularly in those positions doing the work 
on the ground. As part of my review of the Department's organization, 
we are looking at how to better leverage and align bureau resources in 
the field, cut duplication, and allocate assets and personnel more 
effectively.
    Question 8. Increasing Public Private Partnerships is one of the 
many ways to help reduce the National Park Service maintenance backlog.
  --  Which types of P3s do you believe will be most effective in 
            addressing the backlog while also upholding the guiding 
            principles of the NPS?
    Answer. In July, I hosted a roundtable meeting focused on expanding 
public-private partnerships on America's public lands in order to make 
the outdoor recreation experience even better. Public-private 
partnerships can help address the backlog by upgrading visitor 
accommodations, including RV hookups and campgrounds, expanding visitor 
services, including boat ramps and cafeterias, to name a few.
    Question 9. Historic leasing is an example of a public-private 
partnership that could help alleviate the deferred maintenance backlog.
  --  What are your recommendations for how to expand this innovative 
            approach?
    Answer. The Department is currently reviewing opportunities to 
lease under-utilized Federal properties, both historic and non-
historic, as one approach to addressing the maintenance backlog. 
Public-private partnerships will help reduce the Department's 
maintenance backlog, while improving the visitor experience on public 
lands and waters.
    Question 10. What are the goals that the National Park Service 
hoped to achieve with the Capital investment strategy?
  --  Does the focus on the high-priority projects come at the expense 
            of lower-priority projects?
    Answer. The President's budget proposes to balance the Federal 
Government's budget by 2027, in order to do this priorities must be 
identified. The 2018 budget prioritizes taking care of the assets we 
currently own. The majority of ongoing operational requirements cannot 
be deferred and maintenance needs have been postponed for too long.
                  Questions Submitted by Rep. Thompson
    Question 1. Last year, EPA finalized a rule on Privately Owned 
Treatment Works (POTWs). Since then, I've weighed in with the agency to 
express great concern over its impact on treatment facilities in 
Pennsylvania that appear to be inadvertently caught up in the 
regulation. Although the rule was intended for unconventional 
production, I've heard a lot of concern that water derived from 
conventional production will also be subject to the regulation due to a 
lack of definitions and the individual basins cited in the rule.
    What is EPA doing to correct this problem and ensure that 
conventionally derived wastewater is not subject to the POTW rule?
    Answer. Because this matter falls under the jurisdiction of the 
Environmental Protection Agency and not the Department of the Interior, 
we would defer to the EPA for a response to this question.
    Question 2. I would like to request an update on the status of the 
remedial action at the Folcroft Landfill, a property which was 
purchased by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1980 and 
incorporated into the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge under 
legislative authority provided by Congress. In 2001, the property was 
added to the National Priorities List (NPL). Congress initially 
appropriated $11 million for the development of the Refuge, and then 
increased funding to $19.5 million for expansion, including acquisition 
of the Folcroft Landfill (P.L. 96-315). The legislative history of the 
Refuge indicates that Congress intended a portion of the funds to be 
directed toward investigation and on-going maintenance of the Folcroft 
Landfill (P.L. 99-191). Guidance from the EPA requires the Agency to 
consider future land use in the selection of a remedy. What 
communication has the Department of the Interior had with the EPA 
regarding the selection of a remedy for the Folcroft Landfill? What 
remedies are under consideration? Are the remedies under consideration 
by EPA consistent with the future use of the property outlined in the 
John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge's 2012 Comprehensive Conservation 
Plan?
    Question 3. What is the timeline for implementation of a remedy? 
What role will the Department of the Interior play in the remediation 
effort? Can you provide an estimate of the cost of the remediation? 
What will be the contribution from the Department of the Interior and 
other Federal agencies that have been identified as potentially 
responsible parties? Are any of the $19.5 million appropriated by 
Congress still available to fund this effort, or will additional 
appropriations be necessary?
    Question 4. What measures must be put in place by the Department of 
the Interior to maintain the property once remediation efforts have 
been completed?
    Answer to Questions 2-4. During the 1980s and 1990s, the EPA and 
FWS undertook several investigations of contamination within the 
Folcroft Landfill and issued several reports of their findings.
    EPA entered into an Administrative Settlement with a subset of 
private potentially responsible parties, known as the Folcroft Landfill 
Steering Committee (PRP Group), to perform a Remedial Investigation/
Feasibility Study (RI/FS), pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The RI/FS work is 
being conducted by the PRP Group with EPA oversight and in coordination 
with the FWS. The Draft RI report, dated May 2017, was submitted to EPA 
and FWS for review. Comments are currently being compiled and will be 
forwarded to the PRP Group for inclusion in the final document. Once 
the RI is completed, the FS, which discusses and evaluates potential 
remedies for the Folcroft Landfill, will be performed and a FS Report 
will be produced for the agencies' review and comment. It is 
anticipated the draft FS Report will be submitted for review in 2019 or 
2020. Once alternatives have been evaluated, EPA will select a 
preferred remedy for the site in a Proposed Plan, which will be made 
available for public review and comment. Upon receipt of public input, 
EPA will publish a selected remedy in a Record of Decision. The FS 
Report and Proposed Plan should have information regarding estimated 
costs for the various remedy alternatives.
    An integral part of the CERCLA process is the identification of 
``legally applicable or relevant and appropriate standard(s), 
requirement(s), criteria, or limitation(s)'' (ARARs) pursuant to the 
Section 121(d). In May 2017, FWS provided EPA and the PRP Group with 
ARARs for the Folcroft Landfill that include the Refuge's 2012 
Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) and other relevant documents to 
be considered with respect to future use of the Refuge. FWS has 
emphasized that any response action selected for the site must comply 
with these requirements in order to be compatible with the intended 
purpose and future use of the Refuge. In addition, the Department 
issued an Environmental Compliance Memorandum applicable to CERCLA 
response actions on Department-managed lands; it states that the 
Department must concur with a remedy that another agency selects for 
Department-managed land, in order to grant access for implementation of 
that remedy. This should ensure that FWS and the Refuge have an 
adequate voice in determining the remedy for the Folcroft Landfill, 
including ensuring that future land uses are appropriately considered.
    Once a remedy has been selected for the Folcroft Landfill, EPA, 
FWS, the PRP Group, and any other appropriate parties, will negotiate 
the terms of funding and implementing the remedy. FWS does not 
immediately have a response for the inquiry regarding the funds 
appropriated from Congress in 1972 (P.L. 92-327), 1976 (P.L. 94-548), 
and 1980 (P.L. 96-315), ``for acquisition of the Tinicum National 
Environmental Center, for construction of environmental educational 
center facilities, and for other development projects on the Center,'' 
(P.L. 96-315 July 25, 1980) but a search has commenced for records from 
that time period to confirm the expenditures for these expressed 
purposes.
    Once a remedy has been implemented, FWS will amend its CCP to 
include any necessary restrictions on activities (such as actions that 
could disturb the integrity of the remedy), so that the proper 
institutional or engineering controls are memorialized.
                  Questions Submitted by Rep. LaMalfa
    Question 1. As we all know, the Endangered Species Act is in need 
of significant reforms, with the success rate of species' moving from 
endangered to fully recovered around 1-3 percent. In my district, the 
Service's own scientists recommended de-listing the Valley Elderberry 
Longhorn Beetle, yet it remains listed today and imposes major costs to 
flood protection and other projects.
    Listing of other species, like the Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged 
Frog, has resulted in such low-impact events as a trail run being 
canceled. Federal agencies actually believed humans running on existing 
trails could negatively impact listed frogs. What is the Fish and 
Wildlife Service doing to review the listing status for threatened or 
endangered species which have been recommended for de-listing, like the 
Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle?
    Answer. I agree that ESA is in need of reforms and modernization so 
it can operate in a more effective manner, which is why the Department 
has testified before this Committee in support of certain bills 
proposed by your colleagues. The FWS de-lists and down-lists species 
when their status changes and resources are available. Getting species 
off the list due to recovery is a priority, and allows us to focus our 
attention and resources on species that need attention. The pace at 
which de-listings and down-listings occur is dependent on resources 
devoted to on-the-ground recovery implementation and the progress 
toward recovery of individual species, as well as on the complexity of 
status reviews and rulemakings. A total of $225.2 million is proposed 
in the President's FY 2018 budget request to implement the ESA and 
related programs under FWS's Ecological Services program, of which 
$79.6 million is for recovery of species listed as threatened or 
endangered under the ESA. At these funding levels, the FWS will 
continue to address approximately 50 species that have been identified 
for potential de-listing or down-listing under the ESA based upon 
recent 5-year status reviews. FWS plans on making final determinations 
for six species currently proposed for de-listing in FY 2018.
    Question 2. Last year, we saw the Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service and 
National Marine Fisheries Service issue conflicting requirements for 
the operation of Shasta Dam, one demanding higher water releases, the 
other demanding lower releases. These proposals would have dramatically 
reduced water supplies for homes and farms.
    Could centralizing responsibility for ESA-listed species with the 
Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service prevent conflicting directives like these? For 
example, having the Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service subsume the 
responsibilities of the National Marine Fisheries Service?
    Answer. This Administration is examining all options to better 
align agency resources in the field both within Interior and across the 
Federal Government in order to reduce administrative duplication and 
better leverage taxpayer dollars. This review includes consolidating 
Interior bureaus with other Federal agencies. The Administration is 
pursuing near- and long-term strategies to achieve a leaner, and more 
accountable and efficient government.
                    Questions Submitted by Rep. Hice
    Question 1. As you are aware, President Trump has asked for an all-
hands-on-deck approach to offshore research and development, and you 
yourself signed an order on May 1, 2017 directing Interior to look at 
the entire Gulf of Mexico region for potential drilling sites. However, 
A.M. Kurta, acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and 
Readiness, sent a letter to Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), on April 26, 2017, 
stating his belief that military training and related exercises in the 
eastern Gulf necessitate a continuation of Congress' ban on drilling in 
the area (see Letter on page 104).
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  Eastern Gulf Of Mexico--Shared Use with DoD
    --  As a Navy SEAL Commander, you have a strong understanding of 
            the need for military preparedness. How do you reconcile 
            the mission of your Department to promote responsible 
            Federal offshore development with the DoD's mission of 
            military preparedness? Can the two co-exist if the 
            moratorium is lifted?
    Answer. Yes, oil and natural gas exploration and development can 
co-exist safely on the OCS, including in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. 
This is made evident by the fact that in the Central Gulf of Mexico 
Planning Area (CPA) there are 822 active leases, 36 percent of all 
leases in the CPA reside within DoD operations or warning areas. The 
CPA contains the highest amount of oil and gas production on the OCS. 
Another example is that out of the 23 total platforms on the Pacific 
OCS, 11 reside within a DoD equity area. The Department and the Bureau 
of Ocean Energy Management work closely with the DoD to identify those 
areas that industry may gain access to via the offshore oil and gas 
leasing process and to develop lease terms and conditions that protect 
DoD interests.
    --  In the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, military preparedness operations 
            coincide with potential oil and gas development. This 
            requires constant, open communication and an understanding 
            and respect for the mission of both Departments occupying 
            the land. How will you coordinate with the DoD to ensure 
            mutual, responsible management of the Eastern Gulf of 
            Mexico?
    Answer. As with all offshore leasing programs and initiatives, BOEM 
works closely with DoD under a Memorandum of Agreement that facilitates 
the coordination of mutual concerns on the Outer Continental Shelf. DoD 
is consulted early in the leasing program development process and 
collaboration is maintained all the way through the individual lease 
sale execution.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) ``National 
            Oil and Gas Leasing Program'' (previously known as the 5-
            Year Plan)
    --  You've called a new 5-year plan, now known as a ``National Oil 
            and Gas Leasing Program.'' How will the new plan differ 
            from the previously approved plan?
    Answer. The new plan is being developed under the same process 
prescribed by the OCS Lands Act as all other recent 5-year programs. As 
we are early in the new program development it is not possible to say 
if, or how, the new program may differ from the current approved 
program.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  Atlantic
    --  In order to responsibly manage our Nation's natural resources, 
            we must first account for what we have. Please explain the 
            importance of conducting geological and geophysical 
            research in our offshore areas, and how we can use this 
            information to make informed decisions regarding resource 
            management.
    Answer. The main objective of the acquisition and analysis of 
geological and geophysical data is the development of maps and other 
information that can guide and inform our work on the OCS. This is done 
by incorporating the data acquired through G&amp;amp;G surveys and analyzing 
technical information, which develops a basic knowledge of the geologic 
history of an area and its effects on hydrocarbon or strategic/critical 
minerals generation, distribution, and accumulation within the planning 
area. G&amp;amp;G surveys are not used exclusively for oil and gas exploration. 
Seismic surveys, which include geologic coring, are also helpful in 
identifying sand used for restoration of our Nation's beaches and 
barrier islands following severe weather events and for protecting 
coasts and wetlands from erosion. Recent examples of BOEM's sand 
restoration projects include New Jersey, where Long Beach Island has 
been restored in response to erosion caused by Hurricane Sandy and 
Louisiana, where 1,100 acres of marsh, dune, and beach habitat at 
Whiskey Island have been reconstructed. Seismic and geologic coring 
surveys also provide information that is vital to the siting and 
development of offshore renewable energy facilities. G&amp;amp;G surveys also 
help to advance fundamental scientific knowledge and are currently 
conducted in the Gulf of Mexico and in countries around the world.
                  Questions Submitted by Rep. Grijalva
Sacred Sites:
    Question 1. Mr. Secretary, without thoughtful review, land 
management decisions relating to mining and energy development have the 
potential to degrade and desecrate sacred sites, areas, and landscapes. 
How will your approach to energy development on public lands comply 
with the Federal Government's legal and moral obligation to protect and 
preserve sacred places and Native Peoples' religious cultural rights 
and practices?
    Answer. I strongly believe the Department can responsibly develop 
energy resources while working in coordination with tribes on a 
government-to-government basis. I am committed to working with tribes 
to ensure meaningful consultation on land management decisions occurs, 
not only with the Bureau of Land Management, but also with other 
cooperating bureaus that would have an impact on tribes.
Tribal Climate Resilience:
    Question 2. Are American Indian and Native Alaskan communities 
facing profound challenges to their culture, economies, and livelihoods 
because of climate change?
    Answer. The Department is working to support tribal governments and 
trust land managers through the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Tribal 
Resilience Program (TRP) with training, data, tools and access to 
technical experts in order to understand the vulnerabilities of these 
communities and identify risk management strategies. Coastal tribes in 
particular face risk management challenges ranging from harmful algal 
blooms, to ocean acidification, degrading ecosystems, changes in food 
availability, and storm surge and disaster recovery.
    Question 3. Would you agree that the Federal Government has an 
essential and unique role in helping tribal nations prepare for and 
adapt to the impacts of climate change on their land and natural 
resources?
    Answer. As indicated in the response to the previous question, the 
Department fills an important role through the TRP, which coordinates 
with other Federal, tribal, and state partners to invest in information 
and tools needed to support managers, thus enabling tribal and trust 
managers to implement strategies for resilient communities and to 
encourage cooperative solutions.
    Question 4. Why does this budget eliminate the Tribal Climate 
Resilience program?
    Answer. The budget request made difficult choices this year. The 
Department's budget prioritizes self-governance and self-determination, 
and focuses funding in Indian Country on core service activities, fully 
funding the costs for tribes to administer programs for themselves, and 
maintains essential management functions for tribal resources, among 
other things.
    Question 5. The Bureau of Indian Affairs' Tribal Climate Resilience 
Program was one of the few programs at BIA with the word `climate' in 
its name. As of last week, the word `climate' has been removed from the 
title of the BIA program. Did you direct your staff to not use 
``climate change,'' in written memos, briefings or other written 
communication?
    Answer. No, Department staff have not been directed in this manner. 
As an example, climate change continues to be listed as a priority on 
the Department's official website.
    Question 6. Did the President direct your staff to not use 
``climate change,'' in written memos, briefings or other written 
communication?
    Answer. No.
Regional Biosecurity Plan for Micronesia and Hawaii:
    Question 7. The National Invasive Species Council is located within 
the Department of the Interior and is responsible for coordinating the 
Regional Biosecurity Plan for Micronesia and Hawaii. Will you commit 
the Department of the Interior to full participation in implementing 
the Regional Biosecurity Plan?
    Answer. The Department understands the importance of biosecurity in 
the Pacific region, and we continue to support the intent and scope of 
the Regional Biosecurity Plan, which supplements ongoing activities at 
the Department to deal with invasive species. The Department is 
coordinating with NISC and other relevant Federal agencies to implement 
the Regional Biosecurity Plan.
Policy and Managerial Decisions:
    Question 8. Can you point to a single significant policy or 
managerial decision you have made as Secretary that has been to the 
detriment of the coal, oil, and natural gas industries?
    Answer. As I said at my confirmation hearing, as Secretary I am 
committed to managing our Federal lands in a way that best serves those 
who use it, including for recreation, conservation, and responsible 
energy development.
Coal Industry Jobs:
    Question 9. How many Americans were employed in the U.S. coal 
industry in 1985?
    Question 10. How many Americans were employed in the U.S. coal 
industry in 2008?
    Question 11. What factors do you believe led to the decline in U.S. 
coal jobs between 1985 and 2008?
    Question 12. According to both you and President Trump, the ``war 
on coal'' is now over. You have enacted policies and made decisions 
with the intent of reviving the U.S. coal industry. How many jobs do 
you expect to return to the U.S. coal industry by November 2020?
    Question 13. Are you confident that there will be more jobs in the 
U.S. coal industry in November 2020 than there were in November 2016?
    Answer to Questions 9-13. One of my key priorities at the 
Department of the Interior is to support the Administration's America 
First Energy Plan and maintain our Nation's energy dominance by 
advancing domestic energy production, generating revenue, and creating 
and sustaining jobs throughout our country. The free market development 
of our abundant coal resources is an important component of our overall 
energy mix. An all-of-the-above energy approach that includes coal has 
positive impacts on our economy and rural communities that depend on 
coal jobs.
Department of the Interior Employees:
    Question 14. As a Member of the House of Representatives and now as 
the Secretary you have said that the Interior Department needs more 
scientists in the field and fewer lawyers. However your FY 2018 budget 
request decreases full-time staff for the Bureau of Land Management by 
11.3 percent, the National Park Service by 6.4 percent, and the U.S. 
Geological Survey by 13.7 percent. Employees of these bureaus include 
biologists, geologists, chemists, forestry technicians, and other 
scientists. Conversely, the Office of the Solicitor--an office 
comprised almost entirely of lawyers--would add three full-time 
positions under your proposed budget. How does your budget proposal 
comport with your statements that the Department needs more scientists 
and fewer lawyers?
    Answer. The goal is to create a more efficient government that 
effectively delivers programs of the highest importance to the public. 
I have tasked my team to review all programs across the Department to 
determine if there is duplication, and if so, how best to consolidate. 
This review process remains ongoing.
Science-Based Decision Making:
    Question 15. Mr. Secretary, when you were still on this Committee, 
you stated in a 2015 hearing that with respect to the Interior 
Department's decision-making process, ``I think we need to be more 
science-based and less politics, and that would be helpful.'' However 
your budget includes significant cuts to numerous scientific programs 
that conduct vital scientific work. Do you have any science-based 
evidence that the threats facing our Nation's land, water, and wildlife 
from climate change have decreased to the point that these cuts are 
appropriate?
    15a. Do you believe that the cuts within your budget will allow 
decisions made by the Department of the Interior to be more science-
based?
    Answer. As I said at the hearing, in order to reach a balanced 
budget the Department had to make difficult decisions. I believe it 
will encourage the Department and its bureaus to be innovative when 
identifying ways to better manage programs and increase revenues. It is 
also a focused budget that will allow the Department to maintain its 
assets, offer a world-class experience on public lands, promote 
economic growth, and continue to provide unbiased, multi-discipline 
science for use in understanding, mapping, and managing natural 
resources.
Poaching and Trafficking:
    Question 16. Your proposed budget includes significant funding cuts 
for programs that fight poaching and trafficking. It reduces the Fish 
and Wildlife Service law enforcement and international affairs 
accounts, and slashes the Multinational Species Conservation Funds by 
nearly 20 percent. Do you have a plan for how to continue making 
progress in the fight against wildlife crime under these circumstances?
    Answer. The budget proposal maintains sufficient capacity to 
enforce wildlife laws; curb the poaching of some of the world's most 
iconic species, such as elephants and rhinos, by curtailing illicit 
trade; ensure sustainable legal trade; and reduce demand for illegal 
products.
Damage to National Wildlife Refuge Property:
    Question 17. Your budget includes a request for authority for the 
Fish and Wildlife Service to seek compensation from people who damage 
National Wildlife Refuge property. Both the Park Service and NOAA have 
similar authority. Why is it important for the Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service 
to have this authority?
    Answer. This authority is important because when Refuge System 
resources are injured or destroyed, the costs of repair and restoration 
falls upon the appropriated budget for the affected refuge, often at 
the expense of other refuge programs. Competing priorities can leave 
the Service's work undone until the refuge obtains appropriations from 
Congress to address the injury. This delay may result in more intensive 
injuries, higher costs, and long-term degradation of publicly-owned 
Service resources. The public expects that refuge resources, and the 
broad range of activities they support, will be available for future 
generations.
National Wildlife Refuge System:
    Question 18. Do you believe the proposed funding levels for Refuges 
are consistent with your vision of increasing access to America's 
public lands, while also managing and expanding the Refuge System to 
protect and enhance America's wildlife resources?
    Answer. Yes. Through the National Wildlife Refuge System, the 
Service continues the American tradition, started by President Theodore 
Roosevelt in 1903, to protect fish and wildlife and their habitats and 
to provide recreation opportunities for hunting, fishing and other 
outdoor recreation. The proposed budget maintains a commitment to 
provide outdoor recreational opportunities in both rural and urban or 
suburban settings, as well as to support the vital role of volunteers 
on our Refuges.
Assistant Secretary for Insular Affairs:
    Question 19. When you do anticipate we will see the nomination of 
an Assistant Secretary for Insular Affairs? This is a priority for the 
people of the territories because it represents the equal treatment of 
their concerns with the Department's other programs and priorities.
    Answer. The President nominated Doug Domenech to be Assistant 
Secretary for Insular Areas on June 29, 2017, and Mr. Domenech's 
nomination was confirmed by the Senate on September 13, 2017.
Senior Executive Service (SES):
    Question 20. According to news reports, around three dozen Senior 
Executive Service (SES) staff within the Interior Department have 
received notices that they have been reassigned and transferred into 
new positions within the Agency. At the earliest possible time that you 
can disclose information while respecting privacy concerns, please 
provide answers to the following questions:
    20a. How many SES employees have been sent letters informing them 
that they were being transferred into new positions?
    20b. How many of these employees requested those transfers, and 
with how many employees were the transfers discussed, before the 
letters were sent?
    20c. What are the names and current positions of the employees who 
have received these letters? What positions are they being transferred 
into?
    20d. Please provide copies of these letters.
    20e. Of the individuals who have already received letters, identify 
those that work in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and are being 
moved to positions outside the Washington, DC metropolitan area.
    20f. Of the individuals who have already received letters, identify 
those that work outside the Washington, DC metropolitan area and are 
being moved to positions inside the Washington, DC metropolitan area.
    20g. Of the individuals who have already received letters, identify 
those that work in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and are being 
reassigned to positions within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.
    20h. Once the complete relocation costs for each employee being 
relocated is known, including any assistance for selling an employee's 
home, please provide the complete permanent change of station (PSC) 
move figures for each employee, their spouse, and dependents to the 
Committee.
    20i. Will you be sending similar letters to more SES employees in 
the coming months?
    20j. In total, how many SES employees do you expect to reassign and 
transfer?
    20k. As is recommended by the Office of Personnel Management, are 
these reassignments linked to individual Executive Development Plans 
for each employee? For any employee where the transfer is consistent 
with information contained in their Executive Development Plan, please 
provide information on how the transfer is consistent with the Plan to 
the Committee.
    20l. For any employee where the transfer is not consistent with 
information contained in their Executive Development Plan, please 
provide the analysis that was conducted or information that was 
reviewed in order to make the determination to transfer that employee.
    20m. Do you subscribe to the belief that there is a ``deep state'' 
operating within the Federal Government?
    20n. Are Interior Department SES employees a part of the ``deep 
state''?
    Answer. The Senior Executive Service is intended to be a corps of 
versatile, senior Departmental staff. When Congress created the SES 
corps, the intent was to construct a mobile cadre of Executives. Talent 
management and succession planning are crucial to the development of an 
effective SES corps. Managing talent within the SES ranks ensures the 
agency has qualified pool of executives who have the leadership and 
managerial expertise to occupy any number of different executive 
positions based on the needs of the organization. Developing the best 
leadership talent is essential, not just to support agency strategic 
planning, but to contribute to a thriving, sustained performance 
culture in the Federal workforce. The rotation of the SES corps through 
a variety of leadership positions has been recognized as an effective 
method of strengthening leadership and executive skills. Indeed, the 
Obama administration issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13714 on December 
25, 2015 on ``Strengthening the Senior Executive Service.'' That E.O. 
required agencies to develop plans to increase the number of SES who 
are rotated to different assignments ``to improve talent development, 
mission delivery, and collaboration.'' The E.O. established an annual 
Government-wide goal, beginning in FY 2017, of rotating at least 15 
percent of SES to different departments, agencies, sub-components, 
functional areas, sectors and non-Federal partners. In its 2016 
guidance to implementing the SES rotations requirement, OPM identified 
executive reassignment and transfers as two options for implementing 
SES rotations. The SES rotations at Interior were consistent with the 
Civil Service Reform Act (which created the SES), E.O. 13714, and OPM 
guidance on managing the SES.
Border Wall:
    Question 21. Secretary Zinke: You have indicated support for 
President Trump's proposal to construct a wall along the southern 
border. Construction of such a border wall would split the Tohono 
O'odham Nation and threaten the tribe's connection to its ancestral 
lands. How will President Trump's border wall respect tribal 
sovereignty and self-determination?
    Answer. I defer to the Department of Homeland Security for 
decisions on the details of the wall, but I expect the Department of 
Homeland Security will work closely in consultation with the Tohono 
O'odham Nation as it moves forward to secure our borders in accordance 
with the President's directives.
    Question 22. Federal agencies are required to initiate formal 
consultation with Fish and Wildlife Service if their actions ``may 
affect'' a listed species or designated critical habitat. President 
Trump's border wall would affect listed species or designated critical 
habitat. Federal agencies are required to prepare an environmental 
impact statement on major Federal actions ``significantly affecting the 
quality of the human environment.'' President Trump's border wall 
constitutes a major action significantly affecting the environment. 
Have the Departments of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection conducted a new analysis of the proposed wall?
    22a. Do they intend to do so before any construction takes place?
    Answer. I cannot speak to the actions undertaken or contemplated by 
another Department outside my purview and I defer to the Department of 
Homeland Security on this question. More generally, under my 
leadership, Interior bureaus will fully comply with the President's 
directives and existing law as they pertain to securing our borders and 
protecting the environment.
    Question 23. As you have noted, building a wall along the southern 
border is complex. Where then, would the wall go? On the Texan side of 
the Rio Grande? Down the middle of the river? Through Big Bend National 
Park? Through Tribal lands?
    Answer. As noted above, I defer to the Department of Homeland 
Security for decisions on the details of the wall.
    Question 24. How exactly will President Trump extract payment from 
Mexico to pay for the border wall?
    Answer. Decisions related to payments necessary to secure our 
border will be made by the President, in accordance with applicable 
laws.
    Question 25. Should money come from the Interior Department budget 
if Mexico refuses to pay?
    Answer. The Department of Homeland Security is the agency with 
responsibility for securing our borders.
National Heritage Areas:
    Question 26. Last year Senator John McCain requested that the 
National Park Service undertake a ``Reconnaissance Study'' of the Yuma 
Quartermaster Depot to determine its suitability to tell the nationally 
significant story of the past, present, and future of the Colorado 
River. I support his efforts. We know that the work in the field has 
been done by the NPS Intermountain Region. Can your office provide me a 
status report on the ``Reconnaissance Study''?
    Answer. I understand that the NPS continues to make progress on the 
reconnaissance survey of the Yuma Quartermaster Depot, but has not yet 
completed it.
    Question 27. Secretary Zinke, I understand that your community of 
Great Falls is considering asking for designation as a National 
Heritage Area. My community in Arizona has had pretty good results in 
Yuma with the program. What are your general thoughts about the 
National Heritage Area program, which seeks to conserve national and 
historic resources through a community-based approach, as opposed to a 
top-down approach?
    Answer. National Heritage Areas provide cultural benefits, and are 
an example of the benefits of partnerships. However, the President's 
budget proposes to balance the Federal Government's budget by 2027, in 
order to do this priorities must be identified. The 2018 budget 
prioritizes taking care of the assets we currently own. The majority of 
ongoing operational requirements cannot be deferred and maintenance 
needs have been postponed for too long. The National Heritage Area 
Program can be supported through partnerships and community engagement.
Department Staffing:
    Question 28. I'm concerned about the March Executive Order to 
reorganize the executive branch and subsequent Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) memo on reducing the Federal workforce (M-17-22) and what 
that could mean for Interior Department agencies. In the case of the 
National Park Service, I understand that staff levels have been in 
decline, there are now more than 1,500 vacant positions, and that 
Interior has frozen hiring for certain positions as a result of this 
effort. Secretary Zinke, for your confirmation hearing both your verbal 
and written testimony indicated one of your priorities is to ensure 
that park rangers have the resources they need, but this exercise 
threatens that priority.
    28a. What has the Department's position been on this government 
reform effort in conversations with OMB?
    28b. Can you commit to following through on your commitment to 
support staff by ensuring that the Park Service and other Interior 
agencies aren't further understaffed as a result of this exercise?
    Answer. This review process remains ongoing within the Department. 
I have tasked my team to review all programs to determine if there is 
duplication, and if so, how best to consolidate. The goal is to create 
a more efficient government that effectively delivers programs of the 
highest importance to the public. We anticipate a larger effort may be 
folded into the FY 2019 budget process.
    Question 29. The March Executive Order on reorganizing the 
Executive branch and subsequent OMB and DOI guidance concern me a great 
deal. It appears the exercise could be used as an excuse to further 
understaff the park service and other land agencies and cut funding for 
certain programs the administration may not find to be critical. The 
OMB guidance on reducing the Federal workforce (M-17-22) directs 
agencies to use the FY 2018 and FY 2019 budget processes to drive 
workforce reductions. However, while there may well be carefully 
considered opportunities for reform within Interior agencies, I'd like 
to remind you that funding levels for staff and specific agency 
programs are ultimately up to the appropriations committees. To 
prematurely attempt some of these reorganization efforts that would be 
subject to the decision of appropriators without our consultation and 
consent would be a poor use of agency resources. Can you commit to soon 
updating us in writing on the status of this exercise and commit to be 
in regular contact with us in regard to it?
    Answer. As I indicated in response to the previous question, this 
review process remains ongoing within the Department, and we anticipate 
the larger effort may be folded into the FY 2019 budget.
    Question 30. What is the current status of the workforce reduction 
exercise subsequent to the March Executive Order to reorganize the 
Executive branch and subsequent OMB memo on reducing the Federal 
workforce (M-17-22)?
    30a. Please list by agency the programs you will seek to eliminate 
or merge for each Interior agency.
    30b. Please list the staff positions you intend to eliminate for 
each Interior agency.
    Answer. This review process remains ongoing within the Department, 
and we hope to have outcomes to the larger effort folded into the FY 
2019 budget.
Ethics Waivers:
    Question 31. On January 28 of this year, President Trump issued 
Executive Order 13770 entitled: Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch 
Employees. Among other provisions, E.O. 13770 states that appointees in 
the Trump administration will not work on matters they used to lobby 
on, or on matters involving their former employers or clients, for a 
period of 2 years after they are appointed.
    31a. Are you familiar with E.O. 13770, and is it your intent for 
the Interior Department to comply with it?
    31b. Assuming that Mr. Bernhardt is confirmed to be your Deputy 
Secretary, will you require him to comply with E.O. 13770--meaning he 
will not be permitted to work on any matters he was involved in as a 
lobbyist for 2 years?
    31c. Have you been involved in any discussions regarding the 
possibility that Mr. Bernhardt might receive a waiver from complying 
with the E.O.?
    31d. Would you recommend to the President that Mr. Bernhardt 
receive such a waiver?
    31e. Would you make such a waiver public?
    31f. How would such a waiver serve the public interest?
    31g. Have any such waivers been granted to anyone in the Department 
and if so, will you make those waivers public?
    31h. How is nominating Mr. Bernhardt to serve as your Deputy 
consistent with ``draining the swamp'' here in Washington?
    31i. Can you assure this Committee that none of the nominees for 
the remaining Senate-confirmable jobs will turn out to be lobbyists for 
clients with interests before the Department?
    31j. Will you commit to making any waivers of E.O. 13770 granted to 
any employee of the Department of the Interior available to the public?
    Answer. Under my leadership, all Department staff have complied and 
will comply with all applicable ethics requirements and will seek the 
guidance of the Department's Designated Agency Ethics Official when 
clarification is necessary.
Interior Department Hiring Strategy:
    Question 32. Mr. Secretary, you've ordered a hiring freeze for any 
position in Washington, DC and Denver. Interior agencies are also 
subject to a freeze for any GS-12 and higher position, no matter the 
location. Your office must approve waivers to fill these positions and 
has placed a priority on positions involved in oil and gas development. 
You have repeatedly said that Interior's energy strategy will be ``all 
of the above,'' yet you have singled out positions focused on oil and 
gas development for priority hiring. While some agencies within 
Interior are centered on energy development, the NPS and FWS are not, 
and it goes against their mission. It is concerning that you are 
putting a priority on oil and gas development to fill jobs within these 
agencies. Are you trying to change the mission of these two agencies 
with this new hiring strategy?
    Answer. No. With regard to the waiver process, it has been 
structured so that it should not significantly impact the Department's 
ability to address necessary staffing requirements.
Protecting Public Lands:
    Question 33. Mr. Secretary, you've said repeatedly that the review 
of national monuments is not about selling public land. Can you 
guarantee that not 1 acre of Federal land will be given to state or 
county control during your tenure as Secretary?
    33a. If you do give that land away, can you guarantee none of it 
will be sold to private interests?
    Answer. As I have previously stated on multiple occasions, I am 
firmly against the large-scale sale or transfer of Federal lands. I 
also support taking care of the land we own. In all instances, we will 
comply with the laws established by Congress for the management of our 
Federal lands.
National Monuments Review:
    Question 34. Mr. Secretary, you've said the governor and state 
congressional delegation have to be consulted before you make 
recommendations on national monuments. So far you've only met with the 
Republican governors of Utah and Maine. How many governors do you plan 
to meet with as part of this review?
    34a. Just to look at the states affected by this monument review, 
have you reached out yet to the Democratic governors of Washington, 
California, Oregon, Hawaii, Colorado, Connecticut, Rhode Island or 
Montana?
    Answer. To comply with the President's Executive Order, and provide 
a recommendation to the President, we have sought input from 
stakeholders on all levels, from governors, tribal leaders, and Members 
of Congress, to locals on the ground and county commissioners and I 
thank you for the time you took to provide your written comments as 
well. We took all this information into consideration before making 
recommendations to the President.
    Question 35. Mr. Secretary, during your hearing before the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee you informed Senator Gardner 
that Canyons of the Ancients wasn't ``currently on our priority list.''
    35a. Will you share with this Committee what is on your priority 
review list?
    35b. If the public comment period is still underway what determines 
whether a monument is a priority for review?
    35c. What does it take for a monument to be left alone or removed 
from the review list?
    35d. How can the public trust this review process if we have just 
now discovered that there is a second list of monuments that are 
especially threatened by this review?
    35e. Shouldn't the public, elected officials and other stakeholders 
have been aware of this when the comment period started?
    Answer. On May 11, 2017, the Notice of the Opportunity for Public 
Comment was published in the Federal Register, which included a list of 
national monuments under review by the Secretary in accordance with the 
President's Executive Order. The public comment period related to the 
Bears Ears National Monument closed on May 26, 2017, and the comment 
period for all other National Monuments closed on July 10, 2017. The 
Secretary evaluated comments and, in certain instances, visited 
monuments as he prepared his recommendations for the President. As 
monuments were reviewed and found to require no modification, the 
Department removed them from the review and letting press and local 
stakeholders know the Department's decision to keep all interested 
parties informed. A draft report was submitted to the President on 
August 24, 2017, and the final report was released to the public on 
December 5, 2017 and may be found at https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/
files/uploads/revised_final_report.pdf. Final action and authority 
rests with the President.
Access to Public Lands:
    Question 36. Mr. Secretary, according to the BLM, the American 
public does not have adequate access to 23 million acres of BLM-managed 
land, primarily because of land ownership. The previous administration 
dedicated $8 million in 2017 to improving access to these public lands 
by purchasing adjacent property or securing rights-of-way, but your 
budget includes no funds for this purpose. Wouldn't you agree that this 
limits access to BLM land for American hunters, anglers, and outdoor 
enthusiasts?
    Answer. This budget supports efforts to expand access to 
recreational opportunities through targeted investments. Infrastructure 
related investments at our land management bureaus will address areas 
like trail maintenance and signage, which are critical to ensuring 
access to public lands and safety.
The Antiquities Act:
    Question 37. Mr. Secretary, I have heard you say on numerous 
occasions that your top priority as Secretary of Interior is to ensure 
that the Federal Government is a good neighbor and steward of public 
resources. Recommending executive action to decrease protections for 
national monuments would go directly against this fundamental 
principle. Does the President have the legal authority to shrink or 
abolish national monuments?
    Answer. Being a good neighbor remains one of the Department's top 
priorities. Our goal throughout this review process has been to listen 
to our state, local, tribal and Federal partners and make 
recommendations that reflect the wishes of the neighbors who are most 
affected by these monuments. Ultimately, however, our role in the 
review of monuments is to provide a recommendation to the President. 
Final action and authority rests with him.
National Park Service Services:
    Question 38. Since 2011, National Park Service commercial services 
staff has declined by 10 percent. Meanwhile, the number of commercial 
leases has increased by 25 percent, and the number of Commercial Use 
Agreements has nearly tripled. Moreover, the program's workload keeps 
growing, particularly as the agency begins to award new contracts under 
the Visitor Experience Improvements Authority established by last 
year's National Park Service Centennial Act. Your budget proposal 
includes an over half a million dollar cut to commercial services. How 
do you plan to increase P3 partnerships and ensure adequate oversight 
of public resources while reducing the amount of staff devoted to 
commercial services?
    Answer. The President's budget proposes to balance the Federal 
Government's budget by 2027, in order to do this priorities must be 
identified. The 2018 budget prioritizes taking care of the assets we 
currently own. It also focuses on leveraging public-private 
partnerships in order to improve visitor experiences on public lands 
and waters. In addition, as we move forward, I believe that we have to 
realign our employees to make sure that the focus is at the field 
level, rather than in layers of bureaucracy. I am committed to 
providing our front lines in the parks with the appropriate resources 
to get the job done.
Endangered Species Act:
    Question 39. Mr. Secretary, you have said recently that you think 
the states should play a larger role in species conservation but this 
budget proposal absolutely savages the funding streams that make this 
cooperative work possible, including cutting Cooperative Endangered 
Species Fund grants by $34 million to one-third of the current level. 
You can prevent listing species by doing proactive conservation work or 
you can recover species once they require listing; however, this budget 
cuts funding for both. Do you believe that these funding levels are 
adequate to help states be full partners in conserving fish and 
wildlife?
    Answer. The budget requests $19.3 million for the Cooperative 
Endangered Species Conservation Fund. The budget requests $10.5 million 
for conservation grants to states, $6.5 million for Habitat 
Conservation Planning assistance grants, and $2.3 million for 
administrative costs. The budget does not provide funding for land 
acquisition grants in order to focus resources on our current land 
management priorities. The Department encourages states' participation 
in developing recovery plans and proactive conservation work. For 
example, when the yellowcheek darter, a small fish native to forks of 
the Little Red River in Arkansas, was listed as endangered, the Service 
formed a recovery team comprised of yellowcheek darter experts from 
organizations including the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission, 
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, and others. These members are 
integral to development of the recovery plan and increasing 
participation in recovery efforts among private landowners. States, 
through the State Wildlife Grants have focused on proactive 
conservation projects; at least 19 domestic Candidate fish and wildlife 
species were conserved by state fish and wildlife agencies using State 
Wildlife Grant funds.
    Question 40. Along these same lines, you have long opposed the 
historic conservation agreement reached between states and the Obama 
administration to protect the greater sage-grouse and avoid an ESA 
listing. Your recent Secretarial Order requiring a review of the plans 
threatens to turn this conservation success story into a failure, and 
this budget is not helping. The budget cuts $11.5M--22 percent--from 
BLM's sage-grouse conservation efforts.
    40a. Do you think these cuts will have a negative impact on greater 
sage-grouse populations and sagebrush habitat?
    40b. Do you think these cuts make it more likely that the bird will 
require the protections of the ESA?
    40c. Do you oppose the inclusion of a rider on your Department's 
appropriations bill that would prevent you from listing the species 
even if it is shown that such an action is necessary to prevent 
extinction?
    40d. FY 2017 funding for sage-grouse conservation efforts is 
already out the door but your recent order has created uncertainty 
about if and how it will be used. Are BLM field offices authorized to 
use that funding for sage-grouse conservation efforts under the current 
conservation plan, or has your office ordered them to stop?
    Answer. The Department's 2018 Budget reflects the President's 
commitment to fiscal responsibility--proposing sensible and rational 
reductions and making hard choices to reach a balanced budget by 2027. 
This required the Department to take a thorough look at all of our 
mission areas to determine where we could potentially increase 
efficiencies yet continue the implementation of our multiple-use 
mission. The budget includes over $75 million in the Bureau's Wildlife 
Management Program to continue work on the sage landscape and maintain 
our commitment to sage habitat. BLM will continue restoration and 
conservation efforts in priority areas, which will benefit more than 
350 species. This budget continues conservation work with partners and 
supports science at FY 2017 levels. Legislative prohibition on listing 
the greater sage grouse would provide time to implement plans and work 
more closely with states to craft solutions.
    Question 41. As a Member of Congress, you voted against the 
protection of threatened and endangered species 100 percent of the 
time. You are now in charge of implementing the Endangered Species Act, 
not undermining it, but this budget shows that you may not have fully 
made that transition yet.
    Even though it is widely known that current funding levels are 
insufficient to make significant progress toward protecting and 
restoring imperiled fish and wildlife populations, this proposal 
slashes funding for species listing, recovery, habitat protection, 
consultation, and work with states and tribes to prevent listings.
    Given that we are in the middle of a global extinction crisis 
driven by irresponsible land use and climate change do you believe that 
this budget will allow you to meet your statutory obligations under the 
ESA to prevent extinction and recover threatened and endangered 
species?
    Answer. Yes, a total of $225.2 million is proposed to implement the 
Endangered Species Act and related programs under the Service's 
Ecological Services Program, of which $79.6 million is for recovery of 
species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species 
Act. A focus on recovery has recently resulted in the de-listing and 
down-listing of several high-profile species, including the West Indian 
manatee. Included in the Ecological Services request is $98.8 million 
to facilitate planning and consultation that will support economic 
recovery and job creation in the United States. Timely evaluations of 
proposed infrastructure, energy, and other development projects 
contribute to job creation and economic growth, while ensuring that 
impacts to native wildlife and habitat are avoided and minimized to the 
greatest degree possible. Funding will allow the Service to expedite 
project reviews and work with project proponents on appropriate 
mitigation and avoidance measures.
    Question 42. Republican Members of this Committee, including you in 
the past, have argued that the ESA is a failure because more species 
are not being de-listed. This is in spite of the fact that the ESA has 
been 99 percent effective in preventing species from going extinct.
    In order to be de-listed, though, species must be shown by the best 
available science to have recovered. Before the process of recovery can 
even begin, species must first be listed so that they can receive the 
protections of the Act just to ``stop the bleeding.'' This is the 
simple, stepwise fashion in which the ESA works.
    Unfortunately, this budget proposes to cut the listing program by 
more than 17 percent. It also proposes to cut the recovery program by 
more than $3.5 million.
    42a. Do you believe these cuts will allow you to meet your 
obligations to give species ESA protections when it is show that it is 
scientifically necessary?
    42b. Do you believe this budget will achieve your goal of de-
listing more species without running afoul of the requirement to base 
decisions on the best available science?
    42c. Do you believe that at these funding levels FWS will be able 
to avoid losing lawsuits over failing to take required actions to 
protect species in a timely manner?
    Answer. I still believe that ESA is in need of reforms and 
modernization so it can operate in a more effective manner. The FWS de-
lists and down-lists species when their status changes and resources 
are available. Getting species off the list due to recovery is a 
priority, and allows us to focus our attention and resources on species 
that need attention. The pace at which de-listings and down-listings 
occur is dependent on resources devoted to on-the-ground recovery 
implementation and the progress toward recovery of individual species, 
as well as on the complexity of status reviews and rulemakings. A total 
of $225.2 million is proposed in the President's FY 2018 budget request 
to implement the ESA and related programs under FWS's Ecological 
Services program, of which $17.1 million is for listing species and 
$79.6 million is for recovery of species listed as threatened or 
endangered under the ESA. At these funding levels, the FWS will 
continue to address the backlog of listing determinations and develop 
rulemakings for approximately 50 species that have been identified for 
potential de-listing or down-listing under the ESA based upon recent 5-
year status reviews. FWS plans on making final determinations for six 
species currently proposed for de-listing in FY 2018.
Resource Advisory Committees:
    Question 43. Time and time again, you have said you're a champion 
of public access and transparency. On your first day as Secretary, you 
signed Order No. 3347 which encourages access, conservation 
stewardship, and hunting and fishing activities. This order gave 
department agencies 30 days to report on Executive Order 13443, and 
then calls on the expertise of two Resource Advisory Committees to 
refine recommendations. You have since suspended ``all 225 different 
councils and boards . . . so [you] could ask what do you do, who is on 
your board, what have you done in the last year''--this includes the 
two which are involved in Secretarial Order 3347. How is this 
suspension improving access, transparency and efficiency at the 
Interior Department?
    Answer. As you note, Secretarial Order 3347 is designed to engage 
stakeholders on a variety of issues concerning management of public 
lands, including actions to improve habitat, cooperation with state 
wildlife managers, and access to the outdoors. We intend to work with 
stakeholder groups, including but not limited to the two referenced 
groups. The Department's review of advisory groups is ongoing. The 
review is intended to ensure the Department receives maximum feedback 
from these boards and that they are compliant with the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act (FACA).
Coastal Barrier Resources System:
    Question 44. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) administers the 
Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS), established by Congress in 
1982 to prevent government-subsidized development from occurring in 
hazard-prone, undeveloped coastal areas. This simple yet ingenious 
program does not prevent private citizens from using their own money to 
develop land that is included in the System but it does prohibit the 
use of Federal funds including flood insurance, transportation and 
housing grants, and energy infrastructure assistance.
    44a. Do you agree that sea level rise, increased coastal flooding, 
and other hazards due to climate change are a threat to coastal 
communities?
    44b. Do you believe that taxpayers should be on the hook for 
bailing out individuals, companies, and localities that make risky 
development decisions?
    44c. Will you commit to funding the CBRS program at levels that 
reflect the urgent need to address the impacts of sea level rise on 
coastal communities?
    Answer. Coastal communities face weather-related challenges not 
experienced in other parts of the country. The Department will be a 
good partner in working with these communities to address changing 
climate conditions using adaptive management. Through the CBRA program, 
the FWS provides mapping products and data bases that are essential 
tools for conservation and restoration activities by other Federal and 
state agencies and the public and this budget provides sufficient 
resources to support those efforts.
Stream Protection Rule Job Figures:
    A February 21, 2017, a blog post on the Department of the 
Interior's (DOI) website claimed that the Stream Protection Rule (SPR), 
which was repealed by President Trump's signature of a Congressional 
Review Act resolution of disapproval, ``was estimated to put 7,000 
clean coal jobs in 22 states at risk.'' This figure appears to come 
from a widely discredited and outdated draft environmental study, 
generated by Polu Kai Services (PKS) under contract from OSMRE, and 
contradicts the job impacts published by the Department and OSMRE. An 
investigation by the DOI Office of Inspector General found that there 
was widespread dissatisfaction with PKS' performance. Furthermore, the 
OIG investigation found no evidence of any inappropriate behavior by 
anyone in the Obama administration in relation to the dispute over the 
job-loss numbers or the decision to allow the PKS contract to expire. 
This conclusion was also backed up by a multi-year investigation 
conducted by the House Natural Resources Committee, which was also 
unable to find evidence of any wrongdoing.
    Given this, I request answers to the following questions:
    Question 45. Please provide a source for the February 21 claim that 
the Stream Protection Rule put 7,000 clean coal jobs at risk.
    Question 46. Does OSMRE agree with the blog post claiming that the 
SPR would put 7,000 jobs at risk? If so, what is the evidence that the 
regulatory impact analysis performed for the final rule is less 
accurate than the February 21 blog post?
    Question 47. If the February 21 blog post was based on the DEIS 
completed by PKS, are the methods and standards used by PKS to develop 
the DEIS the same methods and standards Congress and the public should 
expect for work performed by OSMRE or DOI throughout the Trump 
administration?
    Question 48. Does OSMRE or DOI believe that the PKS DEIS from 2011 
adequately reflects the provisions of the final SPR published in 2016?
    Question 49. Does OSMRE or DOI disagree with the characterization 
of PKS' performance included in the OIG study? If so, what did the OIG 
miss?
    Question 50. How does the Department define ``clean coal''?
    Answer to Questions 45-50. President Trump signed H.J. Res. 38 into 
law on February 16, 2017, nullifying the SPR. Since then, the 
Department has renewed its focus to put America on track to achieve the 
President's vision for energy independence and bring important jobs 
back to communities across the country. Our Nation's abundant coal 
supplies are an important and stable component of the energy mix. The 
President's energy program will have positive impacts on employment in 
the communities that depend on coal industry jobs.
Office of Natural Resources Revenue Rule:
    As part of responding to the dozens of valuation and royalty-
collection recommendations from the past decade, on July 1, 2016, the 
Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) published a final rule 
entitled Consolidated Federal Oil &amp;amp; Gas and Federal &amp;amp; Indian Coal 
Valuation Reform, with an effective date of January 1, 2017. Despite 
the fact that the rule became effective on January 1, 2017, ONRR 
published a Federal Register notice on February 27, 2017, announcing 
that the effective date of the valuation rule would be postponed 
indefinitely due to legal challenges pending against the rule, using 
the authority under 5 U.S.C. 705 of the Administrative Procedures Act 
(APA). The legality of this action is highly questionable. It appears 
that ONRR has used this provision to repeal an active and in-effect 
regulation in contravention of the notice-and-comment procedures 
required by the APA.
    With the rule in full effect as of January 1, 2017, it became the 
role of the courts, and not ONRR, to adjudicate the challenges to the 
valuation rule. The rule cannot be unilaterally subverted by ONRR. In 
the light of this, I would like answers to the following questions:
    Question 51. Did DOI's Office of the Solicitor provide a written 
opinion or memo regarding the legality of postponing the effective date 
of a rule after the effective date has already passed? If so, please 
provide a copy of that opinion or memo.
    Question 52. Please provide any examples that the Department has of 
other rules where 5 U.S.C. 705 has been successfully invoked to delay 
the implementation date of a rule after the effective date has passed.
    Question 53. Did DOI's Office of the Solicitor review the February 
22, 2017, memo from ONRR?
    Question 54. Please provide the surnaming page of the Federal 
Register notice that was published on February 27, 2017, showing the 
identity of those officials within DOI who reviewed and approved the 
notice.
    Answer to Questions 51-54. As ONRR Director Greg Gould noted in his 
July 12, 2017 response to your previous letters, ONRR's stay of the 
rule is currently the subject of litigation and cannot be commented on 
at this time.
Backlog of Applications for Permit to Drill (APDs):
    The recent publication of internal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) 
strategy and communications documents has provided some disappointing 
insight into the intended focus of the BLM during the current 
administration. One of the more surprising items in the document is the 
instruction to, ``[a]ddress backlog of Applications for Permit to Drill 
(APDs).'' It is not clear that there is a significant backlog of 
unprocessed APDs; in fact, the BLM's own data indicate that there is a 
glut of drilling permits that the oil and gas industry cannot act on 
fast enough. According to the BLM's FY 2017 Budget Justification, there 
were 3,785 APDs pending at the end of FY 2015, but also 7,532 approved 
permits in industry's hands just waiting to be used.
    Question 55. Therefore, in order to understand the true nature of 
the ``backlog'' of APDs, please provide the number of ADPs that are 
pending and the number of approved ADPs waiting to be drilled as of the 
end of the FY 2016.
    Answer. The BLM estimates that, as of the end of FY 2016, there 
were 2,552 pending APDs and 7,950 approved APDs that had not been 
drilled.
U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative:
    In 2011, as part of the Open Government Partnership, the United 
States announced its intention to become an Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI) compliant country. The EITI Advisory 
Committee was scheduled to meet on June 7 and 8 to continue the work 
required of the United States to become EITI compliant. However, on May 
25, 2017, the Department of the Interior published a notice postponing 
the scheduled meeting, saying merely that it would be ``rescheduled at 
a later date.'' When combined with reports from earlier this year, this 
postponement appears to reflect a lack of commitment to EITI by this 
Administration. The Secretary of the Interior serves as the 
Administration's senior official representative for EITI 
implementation.
    Question 56. What is Trump administration's stance on the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative?
    Question 57. Can you commit to holding the postponed U.S. EITI 
Advisory Committee meeting no later than the end of August, 2017?
    Answer to Questions 56-57. The Department of the Interior is 
committed to institutionalizing the principles of open government and 
accountability. The U.S. Department of State will continue to lead the 
United States' commitment to the EITI as a Supporting Country, a role 
that the United States has played since the beginning of the 
initiative.
Review of 5-Year Offshore Leasing Program, as Instructed by April 28 
        E.O.:
    The Department of the Interior has begun a review of the 5-year 
offshore leasing program, as instructed by President Trump's April 28, 
2017, offshore energy Executive Order. Given the likely adverse impacts 
of this action on the environment, fishing, and tourism industries, I 
am deeply concerned with President Trump's decision to lift the leasing 
ban in regions currently closed to development. Secretary Zinke, please 
address the following:
    Question 58. The Executive Order directs a review of areas 
currently closed off from drilling, including the Mid- and South 
Atlantic, the Chukchi Sea, and the Beaufort Sea. Please provide all 
risk assessments and analysis undertaken to determine how lifting the 
ban on drilling in these areas would not adversely affect fragile 
ecosystems or damage fishing, restaurant, or tourism interests.
    Answer. On May 1, 2017, I issued Secretarial Order 3350 to further 
implement the President's Executive Order entitled: ``Implementing an 
America-First Offshore Energy Strategy'' (April 28, 2017), in which I 
directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to initiate development 
of a new 5-year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program. Section 18 of the OCS 
Lands Act prescribes the major steps involved in developing a 5-year 
program, including the ability of the Secretary to review and approve 
the leasing program. During the initial stage of program development, 
the Secretary examines all 26 OCS planning areas to consider and 
balance the potentials for environmental damage, discovery of oil and 
gas, and adverse impact on the coastal zone in making a decision on the 
Draft Proposed Program--the first of three proposals required in the 
Program development process. This process includes conducting risk 
assessment and analysis on the impacts of oil and gas development and 
production. Recently, BOEM began seeking a wide array of input during 
development of this new OCS leasing program, including information on 
the economic, social, and environmental values of all OCS resources. 
BOEM will also seek input on the potential impact of oil and gas 
exploration and development on other resource values of the OCS and the 
marine, coastal, and human environments. All of these analyses will be 
made public as they are completed. At this stage of development of a 
leasing program, no decisions have been made regarding what planning 
areas may be included in the new leasing program.
    Question 59. What additional actions or plans does the Department 
intend to take to protect coastal communities from the possibility of 
another catastrophic oil spill, particularly in light of the unique 
challenges of responding to an oil spill in these environments?
    59a. For example, has the Department conducted any analysis with or 
otherwise coordinated with the Coast Guard to ensure that Area 
Contingency plans are sufficiently robust to address an oil spill the 
magnitude of the Deepwater Horizon?
    Answer. The Department, through its Bureaus and the Office of 
Environmental Policy and Compliance (OEPC), serves on national and 
regional interagency oil spill response teams to develop and maintain 
detailed spill response policies, plans, and procedures, as well as up-
to-date Regional Contingency Plans, Area Contingency Plans, and site-
specific geographic response plans.
    The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) oversees 
oil spill planning and preparedness activities for offshore oil and gas 
exploration, development and production facilities in both Federal and 
state waters. BSEE reviews industry Oil Spill Response Plans to verify 
that owners and operators of offshore facilities are prepared to 
respond to a worst case discharge of oil; the U.S. Coast Guard 
participates in these reviews in certain situations. BSEE, in 
cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard, validates the soundness of these 
plans by conducting exercises with operators.
    The Department and BSEE's (as well as other bureaus) oil spill 
preparedness program is a keystone component of the National Response 
System. As such, the Department regularly participates in meetings and 
supports activities by Regional Response Teams and Area Committees 
where offshore oil and gas operations are conducted. These groups are 
focal points for contingency planning with local, state and Federal 
partners including the Coast Guard. In addition, the Department 
formally engages the U.S. Coast Guard on a regular basis at both the 
regional and headquarters levels to support joint planning initiatives 
and information sharing.
    Question 60. The March 16, 2017 budget blueprint calls for a $1.5 
billion, or 12 percent, reduction to the Department's FY 2018 budget. 
How would these proposed cuts affect the ability of the Department to 
draft a new 5-year plan, which presumably would also include oil spill 
response and mitigation plans, while administering an even greater 
number of oil and gas leases?
    Answer. The Administration's budget makes difficult choices in 
focusing on and funding our top priorities and sets the course to a 
balanced budget by 2027, saving taxpayers $1.6 billion. Among the 
Department's top priorities is to boost domestic energy production to 
stimulate the Nation's economy and ensure our security while providing 
for responsible stewardship of the environment, which includes the 
development of a new 5-year plan. The budget reflects a careful 
analysis of the resources needed to advance this priority and to 
development our bureaus' capacity to carry out its functions carefully, 
responsibly and efficiently.
    Question 61. American fishing, tourism, and recreation industries 
rely on a healthy ocean ecosystem to generate billions of dollars each 
year in economic activity. If this review goes forward, please indicate 
what additional analysis the Department intends to conduct to determine 
what safeguards will be required to protect these industries.
    Answer. At this point, the Department is only establishing a 
schedule of potential lease sales and framing the geographic scope for 
which OCS development can occur. The process is guided by the OCS Lands 
Act which specifies eight factors that are considered in determining 
the timing and location of leasing, including location with respect to 
other uses and environmental sensitivity and marine productivity. As 
required by the law, I will consider each of these factors in deciding 
which areas will be contained in the next National OCS Oil and Gas 
Leasing Program. Public input is critical to this process. There are at 
least three points during the program preparation process when comments 
are solicited, analyzed summarized and used to develop the final 
program.
    Question 62. Given the significant growth of U.S. oil production on 
both private and public lands over the past 7 years, the United States 
is now one of the largest producers of crude oil in the world, and the 
world leader in total liquid hydrocarbon production. In fact, 
oversupply in oil production has led the United States to begin 
exporting crude oil for the first time in generations. Further, gas 
prices in 2016 were the lowest they have been in more than a decade. 
Given these market conditions, why is a new planning process required 
now, as opposed to waiting only 3 years to continue on the normal 
planning schedule?
    Answer. Developing a new National Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing 
Program that respects environmental and economic sensitivities but 
still allows us to responsibly develop our resources is critical to 
reaching President Trump's goal of American energy dominance. Offering 
more areas for energy exploration and responsible development was a 
cornerstone of the President's campaign and this action is the first 
step in making good on that promise for offshore oil and gas. Under the 
last administration, 94 percent of OCS acreage was off-limits to 
responsible development, despite interest from many state and local 
governments and industry leaders. This Administration is dedicated to 
energy dominance, growing the economy and giving the public a say in 
how our natural resources are used, and that is exactly what we are 
doing by opening up the Request for Information and a new OCS leasing 
program.
    Question 63. Under the current leasing program, approximately 70 
percent of the economically recoverable offshore resources in the OCS 
are available to the oil and gas industry for leasing. In the Gulf of 
Mexico, companies hold leases on approximately 16 million acres, but 
have developed only approximately 26 percent of that acreage. Please 
provide all the assessments and analysis the Department has undertaken 
to determine the need for additional leasing acreage at this time.
    Answer. As described in the previous response BOEM has initiated 
development of a new 5-year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program in which 
all 26 planning areas are considered. At this stage of development of a 
leasing program, no decisions have been made regarding the need to make 
available additional acreage for leasing.
    Regarding the statement that industry has only developed 26 percent 
of the acreage leased in the Gulf of Mexico, this percentage applies 
only to the number of leases currently producing, substantially 
understating the percentage of leases on which there is exploration or 
development activity. As of August 1, 2017, there are 2,912 active 
leases in the GOM of which 1,318 (45 percent) have had wells drilled or 
plans approved. Since oil and gas is not uniformly distributed across 
the OCS, there is always a risk of not finding oil and gas on leased 
acreage. New leasing in the Gulf of Mexico allows industry to better 
manage their prospect portfolios and mitigate these risks through 
access to additional acreage where there is potential for discovering 
new oil and gas fields on the OCS. It is important to note that prior 
to acquiring a lease through a BOEM lease sale, the oil and gas 
industry uses geophysical and other types of data extensively in order 
to identify promising prospects and bid on the acreage considered to 
have the best potential.
    During lease primary terms, operators have time to gather, process, 
and interpret additional data. Of course, not all leases contain 
drillable oil and gas resources and wells can be extremely risky and 
expensive to drill. Further, the finite number of drilling rigs 
available for contract limits the number of leases that can be drilled. 
Therefore, lessees are constantly evaluating and prioritizing the 
acreage in their lease inventory in order to drill the most promising 
leases first. This prioritization changes as the exploration process 
plays out (e.g., geological data comes in from new wells and/or new or 
reprocessed geophysical data is acquired, etc.). During the period 
after the lease is acquired, OCS projects compete for the operator's 
available capital with other prospects held by the operator in onshore 
and offshore oil and gas basins worldwide. This dynamic process of 
evaluating, ranking, and funding all worldwide projects of interest to 
a lessee is an important reason why lessees desire to maintain an 
inventory of leases so they can allocate and re-allocate capital 
expenditures as new information becomes available.
Secretarial Order 3349 and Executive Order 13783:
    On March 29, 2017, you signed Secretarial Order No. 3349, which was 
designed to implement the directive in the Executive Order of March 28, 
2017 (Executive Order 13783), to ``review all existing regulations, 
orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency 
actions . . . that potentially burden the development or use of 
domestically produced energy resources.'' The Executive Order and 
Secretarial Order also rescinded or ordered the rescission of a number 
of important Obama administration climate and mitigation policies, 
lifted the moratorium on new coal leases, and ordered the review of 
four common-sense regulations affecting oil and gas operations on 
National Park Service lands, fish and wildlife refuges, and other 
public lands. In order to understand the potentially massive changes in 
public lands policy and management that will arise from the Executive 
Order and Secretarial Order, please provide the following documents 
described in Secretarial Order 3349:
    Question 64. The list of all Department Actions related to 
mitigation policies provided to the Deputy Secretary by each bureau and 
office, as required to be completed by April 12, 2017, as per Section 
5(a)(i) of Secretarial Order 3349;
    Question 65. The list of all Department Actions related to climate 
change policies provided to the Deputy Secretary by each bureau and 
office, as required to be completed by April 12, 2017, as per Section 
5(b)(i) of Secretarial Order 3349;
    Question 66. The report from the Director, Bureau of Land 
Management, on the rule entitled, ``Waste Prevention, Production 
Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation,'' as required to be 
provided to the Assistant Secretary--Land and Minerals Management by 
April 19, 2017, per Section 5(c)(ii) of Secretarial Order 3349;
    Question 67. The report from the Director, National Park Service, 
on the rule entitled, ``General Provisions and Non-Federal Oil and Gas 
Rights,'' as required to be provided to the Assistant Secretary for 
Fish and Wildlife and Parks by April 19, 2017, per Section 5(c)(iii) of 
Secretarial Order 3349;
    Question 68. The report from the Director, Fish and Wildlife 
Service, on the rule entitled, ``Management of Non-Federal Oil and Gas 
Rights,'' as required to be provided to the Assistant Secretary for 
Fish and Wildlife and Parks by April 19, 2017, per Section 5(c)(iv) of 
Secretarial Order 3349; and
    Question 69. The reports from each bureau and office head provided 
to the Deputy Secretary that identify all existing Department Actions 
that ``potentially burden . . . the development or utilization of 
domestically produced energy resources,'' as required by April 19, 
2017, per Section 5(c)(v) of Secretarial Order 3349.
    Answer to Questions 64-69. On November 1, 2017, the Department 
announced the availability of the Final Report: Review of the 
Department of the Interior Actions that Potentially Burden Domestic 
Energy, prepared pursuant to Executive Order 13783. The Department 
published the report in its entirety in the Federal Register, and it is 
available at 82 FR 50532.
DOI Memo Directing Bureau and Acting Directors to Report to the Acting 
        Deputy Secretary:
    On April 12, 2017, you sent a memo to the Assistant Secretaries of 
the Department of the Interior directing them to ensure that all bureau 
heads and office directors report to the Acting/Deputy Secretary on all 
``proposed decisions'' that have ``nationwide, regional, or statewide 
impacts,'' and that decisions may not be made until the Acting Deputy 
Secretary has ``reviewed the report and provided clearance.'' The memo 
also directs bureau heads and office directors to report to the Acting 
Deputy Secretary all FY 2017 grants and cooperative agreements of 
$100,000 or greater before the final award is issued, in order to 
``assess how we are aligning our grants and cooperative agreements to 
Department priorities.''
    In order for us to better understand how this memo will affect 
Departmental policy and operations, please provide answers to the 
following questions:
    Question 70. Has any guidance been provided to bureau heads or 
office directors regarding what constitutes a decision with 
``nationwide, regional, or statewide impacts''? If so, please provide 
that guidance.
    Question 71. Is the Acting Deputy Secretary maintaining approval or 
modification authority over the grants, cooperative agreements, and 
decisions that are provided to him as a result of the April 12 memo?
    Question 72. Has the Acting Deputy Secretary denied any grants or 
cooperative agreements, or required or requested changes to the terms 
of those grants or cooperative agreements, as a result of information 
provided to him as a result of the April 12 memo? If so, please 
identify those grants or cooperative agreements, and information 
regarding why the Acting Deputy Secretary denied or required or 
requested changes to those, as appropriate.
    Question 73. Who in the Secretary's office or Deputy Secretary's 
office, other than the Acting Deputy Secretary, is also reviewing the 
information provided to the Acting Deputy Secretary as a result of the 
April 12 memo?
    Question 74. For all grants and cooperative agreements awarded 
between April 12 and the date of this letter, please provide the 
information under items #1 through #11 as provided to the Acting Deputy 
Secretary under the ``Template for Data Call on Fiscal Year 2017 Grants 
and Cooperative Agreement Awards.''
    Question 75. For all records of decision issued after review by the 
Acting Deputy Secretary between April 12 and the date of this letter, 
please provide all information provided to the Acting Deputy Secretary 
under the ``Template for Data Call on Proposed Records of Decision and 
Other Significant Decision Documents.''
    Answer to Questions 70-75. The process was put in place to help me 
better understand where the approximately $5.5 billion in grant and 
cooperative agreement funding is going and how that benefits the 
Department's mission. I believe we must have a thorough accounting of 
how the Department distributes the taxpayer's dollar. The process has 
moved along quickly and once the review has been completed it will be 
suspended.
DOI Regulations Task Force:
    On April 24, 2017, an article in E&amp;amp;E News reported that you had 
appointed a task force for abolishing regulations, consisting of five 
political ``beachhead'' employees and one career staffer, but no 
Senate-confirmed personnel and no one with clear technical expertise in 
land management, wildlife management, environmental protection, or 
safety regulation. While the task force is required under Executive 
Order 13777, there is no reference to this task force in your 
Secretarial Order implementing Executive Order 13783 (S.O. 3349), and 
no information provided about how this task force will operate, where 
it fits in the regulatory review process created by S.O. 3349, whether 
any of its activities or decisions will be transparent and be made 
known to the public, whether it will accept public comments, or any 
other logistical detail. In order to better understand this task force 
and how it will operate, please provide the following information:
    Question 76. The names of each member of the task force and their 
qualifications for analyzing regulations related to land management, 
wildlife management, environmental protection, and safety;
    Question 77. How career staff with technical expertise in land 
management, wildlife management, environmental protection, and safety 
will be involved in the operations of the task force;
    Question 78. How the task force fits into the process laid out in 
Secretarial Order 3349;
    Question 79. The timeline for the regulatory task force to make 
decisions;
    Question 80. The criteria to be used by the task force to make 
decisions related to whether or not to modify or rescind existing 
regulations;
    Question 81. Whether there will be any public meetings of the task 
force and whether or not the task force will accept comments from the 
public; and
    Question 82. Whether any documents created by the task force are 
intended to be made public once the task force has completed its work.
    Answer to Questions 76-82. In addition to Associate Deputy 
Secretary James Cason's response to your May 2017 letter, we offer the 
following information. The Department's Regulatory Reform Task Force 
was established on March 15, 2017, and meets monthly to evaluate 
existing regulations and provide recommendations to the Secretary 
regarding their repeal, replacement, or modification. The Task Force 
focuses on regulations that: (1) place unnecessary burdens on the 
economy or the American people; (2) are outdated, ineffective, or 
unnecessary; or (3) are incompatible with regulatory reform principles 
or directions established in E.O. 13771 and 13777. The Department has 
invited public input to identify important areas of focus. Since 
publishing a Federal Register notice on June 22, 2017 (82 FR 28429), 
asking the public for ideas to lessen regulatory burdens, we have 
received approximately 215 public comments related to this effort. The 
public also has the opportunity to comment on the inclusion or 
exclusion of any individual regulatory action from the unified 
regulatory agenda, which is issued on a semi-annual basis in accordance 
with E.O. 12866. We have also established a website (https://
www.doi.gov/regulatory-reform) to periodically provide information to 
the public on regulatory reform and encourage the public to share ideas 
on specific regulations that should be repealed, updated, or otherwise 
improved. Regulation development will continue to be informed by public 
input and by agency expertise in the relevant subject matter, whether 
related to land management, wildlife management, environmental 
protection, or safety.
U.S.G.S. Climate Change Report:
    In May of this year, the Washington Post reported that officials 
within the Interior Department ordered employees at the United States 
Geological Survey (USGS) to remove a reference to climate change from a 
press release announcing the publication of a new study on sea level 
rise and coastal flooding. Scrubbing this press release over the 
objections of some of the scientists involved in the study deprived 
media outlets and the general public of the context of the study. In 
order to prevent future abuses of this kind, I request responses to the 
following questions:
    Question 83. Did Acting Deputy Secretary of the Interior James 
Cason, or anyone in his office, or at the Office of Management and 
Budget, review the USGS press release before it was issued?
    Question 84. If so, who made the decision to remove the line 
reported by the authors of the study to read: ``Global climate change 
drives sea-level rise, increasing the frequency of coastal flooding.''?
    Question 85. If not, what was the highest level Departmental office 
that reviewed and edited the press release?
    Answer to Questions 83-85. The U.S. Geological Survey announced the 
findings of the study entitled, Doubling of Coastal Flooding Frequency 
Within Decades Due to Sea-Level Rise in a May 18, 2017, press release 
consistent with existing practices for all Departmental press releases. 
The press release aimed to summarize the overall findings of the 
report, and did not undermine the study findings, as evidence by the 
opening line of the study's abstract, which stated, ``[g]lobal climate 
change drives sea-level rise, increasing the frequency of coastal 
flooding.''
Political Appointees Granted Ethics Waivers:
    On January 28, 2017, President Trump repealed President Obama's 
Executive Order No. 13770 and replaced it with his own Executive Order 
requiring all political appointees to sign an ethics pledge. As with 
his predecessor, President Trump reserved the right to issue waivers to 
exempt certain individuals from this ban. Unlike President Obama, 
however, President Trump is refusing to comply with the Office of 
Government Ethics' request for a list of those political appointees 
granted such waivers. The current Administration's refusal to comply 
with this completely reasonable and standard request for information 
flies in the face of the President's repeated claims to support an open 
and transparent government of which the American people can be proud.
    Question 86. In the interests of clarity and openness, please 
disclose all ethics waivers granted since the beginning of the current 
Administration for political appointees working for the Department of 
the Interior.
    Answer. We are not aware of any ethics waivers granted since the 
beginning of this Administration for political appointees at the 
Department.
Review of National Monuments:
    On April 26, 2017, President Trump ordered a sweeping review of a 
wide range of national monuments established under the Antiquities Act 
in the last 20 years. The Executive Order directed the Department of 
the Interior with 45 days to issue a report on the Bears Ears National 
Monument in Utah and any other monument determined appropriate for 
inclusion in the interim report. The justification for this review was 
the allegation that certain monument designations were made without 
sufficient public input and a review was needed to allow the American 
people to comment on their national monuments. The justification for 
this review was the allegation that certain monument designations were 
made without sufficient public input and a review was needed to allow 
the American people to comment on their national monuments.
    Question 87. In the spirit of transparency and open government, 
please provide a detailed itinerary and list of your meetings while in 
Utah and any other location associated with the review of national 
monuments.
    Question 88. Additionally, please provide an account of all 
comments received during the public comment period that includes a 
tally of positive and negative submissions.
    Answer to Questions 87-88. A draft report, which includes the 
Department's findings and recommendations on national monuments was 
submitted to the President on August 24, 2017 in accordance with the 
President's Executive Order. The final report was released to the 
public on December 5, 2017 and may be found at https://www.doi.gov/
sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/revised_final_report.pdf. Final action and 
authority rests with the President.
Methane Waste Rule Pullback:
    On June 15, 2017, in apparent contravention of the Administrative 
Procedures Act (APA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published in 
the Federal Register a postponement of the effective date of portions 
of the BLM's rule on methane waste, titled Waste Prevention, Production 
Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation (Methane Waste Rule). 
As with the Department's postponement of the Consolidated Federal Oil &amp;amp; 
Gas and Federal &amp;amp; Indian Coal Valuation Reform (Valuation Rule) 
regulation on February 27, 2017, the authority claimed for postponement 
of the effective date is Section 705 of the Administrative Procedures 
Act (5 U.S.C. 705), a questionable interpretation of that section that, 
to my knowledge, the Department has made no effort to defend as of this 
date. Postponing the compliance dates contained in the Methane Waste 
Rule unlawfully deprives the American people of valuable revenue, 
wastes a non-renewable resource, and threatens people's health by 
increasing the amount of harmful pollution in our air. Please provide 
answers to the following:
    Question 89. Did DOI's Office of the Solicitor provide a written 
opinion or memo regarding the legality of postponing the compliance 
dates in a rule after the effective date of that rule has already 
passed? If so, please provide a copy of that opinion or memo.
    Question 90. Did DOI or BLM perform a legal analysis of the Methane 
Waste Rule under the four-part test for preliminary injunctions? If so, 
please provide a copy of that analysis.
    Answer to Questions 89-90. The BLM's Waste Prevention Rule is 
currently the subject of ongoing litigation. I note that in the June 
15, 2017 Federal Register publication postponing certain compliance 
dates for the rule, the BLM concluded that, in light of the pending 
litigation related to the rule and the ongoing administrative review of 
rules, postponement of the January 2018 compliance dates would be in 
the interest of justice, consistent with section 705 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
                  Questions Submitted by Rep. Huffman
    Question 1. Reliable broadband access can frequently be hard to 
come by in rural communities that border our public lands. As you may 
know, I recently introduced the Public Lands Telecommunications Act, 
which provides public land management agencies with fee retention 
authority to increase funding for telecommunications deployment, and 
cooperative agreement authority to improve partnerships with local 
communities and the private sector to expand broadband access. I have 
long believed that our public land management agencies could do more to 
improve broadband access in remote and rural communicates.
    How do you believe the Department of the Interior could achieve 
this aim with new, sustained funding for telecommunications deployment, 
as well as cooperative agreement authority to improve partnerships with 
our constituents and the private sector?
    Answer. The Administration has not been requested to provide its 
position on your bill, H.R. 2425, the Public Lands Telecommunications 
Act, which was reported out of the House Natural Resources Committee on 
June 27, 2017. However, the Department supports innovative public-
private partnerships, and believes that they are important for 
management of all Federal lands. I have consistently advocated for 
increased Internet access on our Federal lands to help enhance the 
outdoor experience for visitors, particularly millennials.
    Question 2. Ranching is important to my district. Last year, I 
rallied with local cattle and dairy operators to fight a lawsuit that 
would have limited their grazing rights in the Point Reyes National 
Seashore area. This is because I believe that carefully management of 
land resources can allow ranching and conservation to co-exist.
    In my district, the Marin Carbon Project has demonstrated that 
rangeland soils can achieve significant carbon sequestration through 
use of `carbon farming' techniques, such as the application of compost 
as a soil amendment. Barriers to such carbon farming techniques from 
being more widely among California's ranching community include lack of 
state and Federal funding, and lack of understanding among conservation 
and land management agencies, and ranchers, regarding how carbon gets 
stored and lost in soils.
    What steps could the Department of the Interior take to help local 
ranching communities integrate carbon farming techniques into 
traditional ranching practices?
    Answer. Being a good neighbor through better collaboration with 
local ranchers and ranching communities is a critical step to ensure 
the success of any government action. It is my belief that more 
meaningful involvement and cooperation with communities closest to our 
public lands will result in innovative ideas and practices as well as 
better stewardship of the land and its resources.
    Question 3. California salmon runs have collapsed during the recent 
drought, in both the Klamath and Bay-Delta watersheds. This year marked 
the lowest they have been on record, prompting a complete fisheries 
closure on the Klamath.
    3a. How will your agency prioritize salmon restoration in the 
coming fiscal year? How is this need reflected in the Department of the 
Interior's budget, as proposed in the President's Budget Request?
    3b. Does the Department of the Interior plan to participate in 
financing the proposed Delta tunnels (California WaterFix) that are 
currently under evaluation by Federal regulators and the Bureau of 
Reclamation?
    3c. Is there a finance plan for those tunnels? If so, can you 
provide it to us?
    3d. Are any Bureau of Reclamation contractors ready to pay their 
proportional share of the cost of the tunnels?
    3e. How confident are you that this project will not result in the 
large cost over-runs that are commonly characterize large 
infrastructure projects?
    3f. Is the Bureau of Reclamation considering asking Federal 
taxpayers to subsidize the construction of a Shasta Dam raise?
    Answer. The President's Budget Request includes funding for salmon 
restoration activities in the Klamath and Bay-Delta watersheds. While 
the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is the primary agency 
charged with implementing salmon protections; Bureau of Reclamation 
project operations support many NMFS activities. Pursuant to the 
Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), the Department 
developed the Anadromous Fish Restoration Program's 2001 Final 
Restoration Plan, which identified 289 actions and evaluations that 
were determined to be reasonable given numerous technical, legal and 
implementation considerations. The annual appropriation bill from 
Congress provides budget authority based on estimated CVPIA 
collections, and the obligation of these funds can only occur after the 
collections are made.
    The President's budget request includes $9.2 million for the 
Klamath Project for ESA activities for the 2013 Biological Opinion that 
will be implemented over 10 years, including effects analysis of 
ongoing Reclamation project operations and the Klamath River Coho 
monitoring program.
    On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NMFS 
released biological opinions on the proposed construction and operation 
of California WaterFix. The Department has made no funding-related 
commitments and has not been engaged regarding the creation of a 
finance plan. No decisions been made on raising Shasta Dam, as 
alternative means of financing (primarily non-Federal) for the 
construction costs would have to be identified and approved by 
Congress.
    Question 4. Renewable energy development has broad bipartisan 
support, and plays a large and growing role in our economy. A 2017 
Department of Energy report found that solar supports 373,807 jobs. 
This is more than the number of jobs in natural gas (362,118), and over 
twice the number of jobs in coal (160,119). Wind also supports 101,738 
jobs. Smartly sited, large-scale renewable energy projects on public 
lands have drawn support from rural counties and other important 
stakeholders.
    If the new Administration is committed to an ``all-of-the-above'' 
energy strategy, then why is renewable energy the only energy program 
that is proposed to be cut?
    Answer. The America First Energy Plan is an ``all-of-the-above'' 
approach that includes oil and gas, coal, and renewable resources. The 
FY 2018 budget request funds onshore and offshore renewable energy 
development at a level that is expected to address current industry 
demand. The Department is also taking steps to improve its leasing 
processes, including implementation of BLM's competitive leasing rule. 
This will support a competitive leasing process for solar and wind 
energy development. The rulemaking updates and codifies acreage rent 
and megawatt capacity fees for wind and solar energy projects, 
establishes a new rate adjustment method that provides greater 
certainty and fair return for use of the public lands, provides 
incentives for leases within designated leasing areas, updates project 
bonding requirements, and incorporates sensible solar and wind energy 
policies into the right-of-way regulations.
    Question 5. On June 20, 2017, when Senator Cory Gardner asked you 
whether Canyons of the Ancients National Monument would be impacted by 
the broader Federal review of NMs, you mentioned that it wasn't on your 
``priority review list.'' This was despite the Canyons of the Ancients 
NM being specifically named on your list of National Monuments under 
review. Again, the following day (June 21, 2017), during a Senate 
subcommittee hearing, you indicated to Senator Tom Udall that you were 
unlikely to recommend changes to any New Mexico monuments.
    Stating that some National Monuments will be left alone, even 
though they were listed on the DOI ``priority review list'' and before 
the public comment period is finished, seems arbitrary. Which national 
monuments are actually on your ``priority review list?''
    Answer. All of the national monuments listed in May 11, 2017, 
Federal Register have been reviewed in accordance with the President's 
Executive Order. The Secretary evaluated comments and, in certain 
instances, visited monuments as he prepared his recommendations for the 
President. As monuments were reviewed and found to require no 
modification, the Department removed them from the review and let press 
and local stakeholders know the Department's decision to keep all 
interested parties informed. A draft report was submitted to the 
President on August 24, 2017 and the final report was released to the 
public on December 5, 2017 and may be found at https://www.doi.gov/
sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/revised_final_report.pdf. Final action and 
authority rests with the President.
PART II
    On May 24, 2016, Mr. John Bezdek, Senior Advisor to the Deputy 
Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior, testified before the Water, 
Power and Oceans Subcommittee regarding the bills H.R. 4366, ``To 
affirm an agreement between the United States and Westlands Water 
District dated September 15, 2015, and for other purposes;'' and H.R. 
5217, ``To affirm ``The Agreement Between the United States and 
Westlands Water District'' dated September 15, 2015, ``The Agreement 
Between the United States, San Luis Water District, Panoche Water 
District and Pacheco Water District,'' and for other purposes.'' At the 
time, the Department of the Interior was supporting a legal settlement 
between the United States and Westlands Water District, and you have 
given no indication that this support no longer holds true in this new 
Administration. The Department of the Interior never responded to 
questions regarding this, that I repeatedly submitted, and as such it 
is my sincere hope that you will address the following questions now 
that they fall under your tenure.
    Question 1. Please provide an estimate of the total financial 
benefit that would be provided to San Luis Unit contractors if H.R. 
4366 and H.R. 5217 are enacted. Please include financial benefits 
associated with waiving Central Valley Project (CVP) repayment 
obligations, Reclamation Reform Act waivers, title transfers of 
property owned by the Federal Government and other direct and indirect 
financial benefits contained in both bills.
    Answer. The Department continues to support the enactment of 
legislation to resolve Reclamation's statutory obligation to provide 
drainage to the entire San Luis Unit, provided that an appropriate 
offset is identified. The settlement agreement authorized by H.R. 1769 
would relieve the United States' obligation to provide drainage service 
to Westlands Water District (Westlands) in exchange for relieving 
Westlands from the obligation to repay certain debts, primarily 
consisting of its share of capitalized construction costs for the 
Central Valley Project (CVP). While H.R. 1769 would reduce the need for 
appropriations related to this construction, it would have an upfront 
mandatory cost. If an appropriate offset were identified, the 
Administration would support H.R. 1769. The present value of the debts 
that would be relieved is estimated to be $331.1 million. Reclamation's 
assessment of the benefits to the San Luis Water District pursuant to 
the April 2017 Agreement between the United States and San Luis Water 
District is estimated at $69.1 million. These benefits primarily 
consist of the relief of current, unpaid capitalized construction costs 
for the CVP, relief of the current operations and maintenance 
obligations for the Grasslands Bypass Project and relief of the 
current, unpaid capitalized construction costs of the Demonstration 
Treatment Plant.
    Question 2. Under the settlement agreements, does the waiver of CVP 
repayment obligations include the capital obligation for the Trinity 
River Division facilities including the Trinity River hatchery?
    Answer. The relief of current, unpaid CVP capital obligations 
includes the Trinity River Diversion facilities, but does not include 
the Trinity River hatchery because the hatchery is considered non-
reimbursable.
    Question 3. If the settlement agreements are enacted, how much 
Trinity River Division water will be allocated under the new 9(d) 
contracts provided for in the settlements?
    Answer. The CVP is an integrated system and is operated as such. 
Reclamation does not allocate or quantify water deliveries uniquely 
from individual units/divisions of the CVP. Under the settlement, new 
9(d) contracts, if authorized by Congress, would continue to allocate 
CVP water as an integrated system, in compliance with Federal law, 
including then-existing biological opinions, and subject to shortage 
provisions.
    Question 4. As Trustee for the Hoopa Valley Tribe, how can the 
Administration agree to a settlement based on a CVP water supply to 
which the trust beneficiary tribe has first priority under Reclamation 
law, without ensuring that any pending dispute the San Luis Unit 
contractors have about that priority is fully and finally resolved in 
the beneficiary's favor?
    Answer. If the settlement agreements were approved by Congress, the 
Department would continue to fulfill its trust responsibilities to the 
Hoopa Valley Tribe, while managing the CVP as an integrated unit, 
subject to reclamation and other laws.
    Question 5. Section 3404(c)(2) of the Central Valley Project 
Improvement Act (CVPIA) requires the Secretary of Interior to 
incorporate in any contract for CVP water the provisions of the CVPIA 
and other law. Will you agree to fulfill that requirement in the 
agreements that would be authorized by the settlement, including: (1) 
the CVPIA requirement for contractors to pay for the costs of the 
Trinity River Restoration program for as long as water is diverted by 
the Trinity River Division; (2) acceptance of the separate priorities 
provided for in section 2 of the 1955 Act authorizing the Trinity 
Division and senior to diversions to the Central Valley? If not, why 
not?
    Answer. It is Reclamation's standard practice to include compliance 
with all applicable laws in any contract. In terms of funding, the 
Trinity River Restoration Program is funded by both the CVP Restoration 
Fund and appropriations. Westlands will continue to pay the CVP 
Restoration Fund charges based on its full contract amount, including 
on water above the 75 percent cap that Reclamation may use for other 
CVP purposes. Therefore, the Settlement will not impact CVP Restoration 
Fund collections.
    Question 6. Why does the Administration believe that this this 
drainage settlement should proceed when fundamental issues regarding 
entitlement to water for delivery to the San Luis Unit remain 
unresolved? If San Luis Unit contractors are not entitled to the water 
being sought in this settlement, wouldn't a consequent reduction in 
water deliveries to the San Luis Unit potentially resolve a portion of 
the drainage problem by reductions in CVP water deliveries to the San 
Luis Unit?
    Answer. Reclamation is unaware of any fundamental issues regarding 
its obligations to fulfill the San Luis Act of 1960 and deliver water, 
subject to certain conditions, to the CVP contractors in the San Luis 
Unit. Under the drainage settlement, the United States will have the 
exclusive right to use all CVP water made available to Westlands in 
excess of 75 percent of Westlands' contract quantity, or 895,000 acre-
feet. The United States' exclusive right to use the CVP water made 
available to Westlands in excess of 895,000 acre feet will also be an 
enforceable term in Westlands 9(d) repayment contract.
    Question 7. On December 23, 2014, the Solicitor of the Department 
of the Interior issued Opinion M-37030 regarding Trinity River Division 
Authorization's 50,000 Acre-Foot Proviso and the 1959 Contract between 
the Bureau of Reclamation and Humboldt County. In the 18 months since 
then, have the Department's water managers accounted for that opinion's 
conclusion in CVP operations models and estimates of water supply? If 
yes, what has the Department done? If not, why not?
    Answer. Reclamation has begun implementing the opinion through its 
Long Term Plan to Protect Adult Salmon in the Lower Klamath River, 
including through the development of an environmental impact statement 
supporting the Plan, and its flow augmentation in prior years. Each of 
these actions is supported by modeling of CVP water supplies that 
includes consideration of proviso 2 of the opinion.
    Question 8. In an April 21, 2016 letter to Representative David 
Valadao, Deputy Interior Secretary Michael Connor states that ``it is 
widely recognized that the drainage issue may have lessened over the 
last few years due to drought and irrigation efficiencies.'' Has the 
Department of the Interior developed any updated calculations since the 
2007 Record of Decision to estimate the current cost of providing 
drainage to the San Luis Unit? If no updated estimates have been 
developed, does the Department of the Interior believe--based on 
increased irrigation efficiencies and other developments since the 2007 
Record of Decision--that a current estimate of drainage costs would be 
less than the costs identified in 2007?
    Answer. While Reclamation has not completed a comprehensive 
analysis of the changes in drainage patterns and needs that may result 
from the changes in cropping patterns and irrigation efficiencies that 
have occurred in the San Luis unit since the a 2008 Feasibility Study, 
historic hydrologic records indicate that wet cycles will return and 
drainage will again become a substantial challenge in the San Luis 
Unit. A variety of factors influence the cost of providing drainage 
service. Some costs, such as the costs of evaporation ponds, reuse 
areas, collection systems, and selenium biotreatment, could be reduced 
by changes in cropping patterns or other irrigation efficiencies, while 
other costs such as land retirement could increase over time. However, 
any such future cost estimates are speculative absent additional 
analysis, and any such cost savings are not expected to result in 
savings of such a magnitude that the Department would not continue to 
support the Westlands Settlement and San Luis Agreement.
    Question 9. The Termsheet on the proposed Northerly District 
Agreement is vague about the future status of the San Luis Drain, and 
the future management and cleanup of sediments in the Drain. Under some 
scenarios, the future management of the Drain and its sediments could 
have an adverse impact on national wildlife refuges and other wetlands 
that Interior Department agencies are supposed to protect under 
numerous laws. For example, Section 3406(d) of the Central Valley 
Project Improvement Act requires the Secretary of Interior to maintain 
and improve wetland habitat areas in California, by providing water 
supplies and supporting the objectives of the Central Valley Habitat 
Joint Venture. In accordance with the Department of the Interior's 
wetlands-related responsibilities, what is the Department's plan for 
the future management of the San Luis Drain in and around the 
Grasslands complex of state, Federal and privately managed wetlands? 
How will the Department of the Interior ensure that all potential 
impacts from the Drain and its future management and cleanup will not 
adversely impact these wetlands and the numerous species they support 
before the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation 
relinquish Federal control of the Drain?
    Answer. Reclamation intends to continue to use the San Luis 
Interceptor Drain for the purposes of conveyance of drain water and 
storm water for the duration of the Grassland Bypass Project, which 
operates under the terms of the 2009-2019 Agreement for Continued Use 
of the San Luis Drain between the San Luis &amp;amp; Delta-Mendota Water 
Authority and Reclamation. The impacts of this use were evaluated in 
Reclamation's Grassland Bypass Project 2010-2019, Environmental Impact 
Statement and Environmental Impact Report and resulting Record of 
Decision.
    Reclamation has met several times with Grasslands Water District 
and other stakeholders to discuss the possible future use of the San 
Luis Drain. However, no formal discussions have begun regarding the 
future use of the San Luis Drain outside of the general discussions 
with stakeholders.
    If the San Luis Drain remains in Reclamation ownership and a new 
stormwater use agreement is desired by the local stakeholders after the 
expiration of the Grasslands Bypass Project in 2019, or other uses were 
sought for the drain by the local stakeholders, then Reclamation would 
work to negotiate the appropriate agreements for those uses and comply 
with the National Environmental Policy Act and other applicable Federal 
law to determine the potential impacts of those uses. If title transfer 
for the San Luis Drain to another entity or entities is authorized by 
the Congress, compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and 
other applicable Federal law would be required prior to the transfer. 
As part of the title transfer effort, Reclamation would work with the 
receiving entity or entities to determine anticipated future use of the 
drain and analyze this anticipated future use, as appropriate, in the 
National Environmental Policy Act documentation and in compliance with 
applicable Federal law, prior to such title transfer.
                 Questions Submitted by Rep. Napolitano
    Question 1. President Trump's Executive Order on the Review of 
Designations Under the Antiquities Act on April 26, 2017 stated, 
``Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall 
provide a final report to the President.'' Do you expect the report to 
be finished on time?
    1a. Will your report recommend any action and/or changes through 
the legislative process or through Executive Order?
    1b. After these recommends, how can local residents, business and 
cities be confident to implement their city and business plans without 
fear that the President or the Interior Department will review their 
nearby designation again?
    Answer. A draft report, which includes the Department's findings 
and recommendations on national monuments in accordance with the 
President's Executive Order, was submitted to the President on August 
24, 2017, and the final report was released to the public on December 
5, 2017 and may be found at https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/
uploads/revised_final_report.pdf. As we move forward in managing the 
Federal lands, we will continue to coordinate with all levels, from 
locals on the ground and county commissioners to governors, tribal 
leaders, and Members of Congress to fulfill our mission to be a good 
neighbor.
    Question 2. Do you plan to visit the San Gabriel Mountains National 
Monument before the comment period ends on July 10, 2017?
    2a. If not, how do you plan to make a decision on the San Gabriel 
Mountains National Monument without meeting with local residents, 
businesses and cities?
    2b. What other information besides public comments made online will 
you take into consideration? Where will that information come from and 
who? How can local residents, businesses and cities ensure that that 
information is in their best interest?
    Answer. Each monument was reviewed in a holistic fashion. Although 
I was not able to visit the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument 
before the comment period ended, we heard from the local communities 
including state, county and federally elected officials, tribes, local 
businesses, and trade associations and I thank you for the input you 
provided to me. For all of the reviews, each group's input was weighed 
when we crafted recommendations for the President.
    Question 3. The monument designation has helped San Gabriel 
communities leverage additional Federal dollars for critically needed 
recreation, trail maintenance, trash collection and fire prevention. 
Seeing that three major fires--the 2009 Station Fire, the 2014 Colby 
Fire, and the 2015 Cabin Fire--have threated our local communities. How 
do you expect our region to continue to fight forest fires without this 
critical designation?
    Answer. Wildfires are not constrained by land ownership or land 
designation. The Department is committed to ensuring that all our 
firefighting assets are utilized in the most efficient way possible, 
regardless of land designation, and that we work with other Federal 
agencies, along with our state and local partners, to improve our 
operational efficiency and take advantage of the firefighting 
infrastructure and assets that are currently in place.
    Question 4. Thanks to the help of the designation, the monument has 
raised more than $5 million through the San Gabriel Mountains National 
Monument fund. One example, is Coca-Cola was has donated $900,000 
toward clean-up efforts in the forest. This was possible because USFS 
land cannot form private-public partnership unless they are designated 
a national monument. Seeing that the USFS and Interior Department 
budgets continue to shrink, do you believe public-private partnerships 
like the one listed above is important for our parks?
    a. Without a monument designation, how do you plan to allow USFS 
lands to form these partnerships?
    Answer. We support innovative public-private partnerships, and 
believe that they are important for management of all Federal lands, 
regardless of designation or land managing agency.
    Question 5. Many water agencies in the arid West are looking toward 
recycled water projects as the most cost effective solution to drought 
management; do you believe we should start to refocus our investments 
toward recycled water?
    5a. What does President Trump's budget do to support recycled water 
projects?
    5b. How can an increase in funding impact the amount of water 
projects that can be introduced in the drought-stricken West?
    Answer. I believe it is important to look at a wide range of 
approaches when it comes to helping the west effectively manage 
drought. The Bureau of Reclamation's Title XVI Water Reclamation and 
Reuse Program supports water supply sustainability by leveraging 
Federal and non-Federal funding to conserve tens of thousands of acre-
feet of water each year. Since 1992, approximately $672 million in 
Federal funding has been leveraged with non-Federal funding to 
implement more than $3.3 billion in water reuse improvements. 
Reclamation announced in July 2017 a new funding opportunity for Title 
XVI projects pursuant to new authority under the Water Infrastructure 
Improvements for the Nation Act (P.L. 114-322).
                   Questions Submitted by Rep. Sablan
    Question 1. In 2005, Interior's Office of Insular Affairs started a 
competitive system for allocating among the U.S. territories $27.72 
million in Covenant Funds that originally all went to the Northern 
Marianas to help build our public infrastructure. The Northern Marianas 
currently receives only about a third of the money. The competition is 
largely based on financial management criteria. Financial management is 
important but so is infrastructure. According to the EPA, Saipan, the 
main island in the Northern Marianas, is the only U.S. municipality 
without 24-hour potable water. That is a serious health concern. Isn't 
it time to look at new criteria for the $27.72 million in Marianas 
Covenant Funds, so that public health and safety needs are prioritized?
    Answer. The capital infrastructure project (CIP) program funds a 
variety of critical infrastructure needs in the U.S. territories, such 
as ports, hospitals, schools, water, public buildings, solid waste, 
energy and public safety. As you noted, the annual allocation of CIP 
funds is made on the basis of competitive criteria that measure the 
demonstrated ability of the governments to exercise prudent financial 
management practices and to meet Federal grant requirements. These 
criteria are evaluated and revised as necessary every 5 years.
    Question 2. OIA budget justifications for FY 2018 tout the 
importance of various programs including the Technical and Maintenance 
Assistance Programs, the Brown Tree Snake Control and Coral Reef 
Initiatives, and the Empowering Insular Communities program. Yet the 
request includes steep funding cuts to each of these programs. I 
appreciate the need to control spending, but these across-the-board 
cuts would likely end up costing much more, both at the Federal and 
local levels, if programs are not properly implemented. The Brown Tree 
Snake Control Program costs a few million, but if these snakes spread, 
as they have on Guam, the cost in damage to electrical systems and the 
extermination of native endangered birds would cost tens of millions or 
more. Isn't it a wiser use of taxpayers' money to prevent problems than 
to try to fix them after the damage is done?
    Answer. Overall, for 2018, the Administration identified areas 
where the Federal Government could reduce spending and also areas for 
investment, such as addressing the maintenance backlog across the 
National Park System and increasing domestic energy production on 
Federal lands. The 2018 budget requires restrained spending in order to 
meet the goal of balancing the budget within 10 years. Specifically 
with regard to the brown treesnake, we recently announced approximately 
$3.5 million through the Office of Insular Affairs to continue 
supporting efforts to control the brown treesnake on Guam and prevent 
its spread to Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, 
and the larger Micronesian region. This supplements more than $250,000 
in brown treesnake investments made by the U.S. Geological Survey and 
the FWS in FY 2017.
    Question 3. Territorial Representatives Bordallo, Radewagen, 
Plaskett, and I sent you a letter dated March 9, 2017, asking that you 
retain the position of Assistant Secretary for Insular Areas. We have 
not received a response to date. The Office of Insular Affairs has 
administrative responsibility for coordinating Federal policy in the 
U.S. territories of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Keeping the position of Assistant 
Secretary for Insular Areas, equal to other Assistant Secretaries in 
the Department, is an important symbol of respect for our constituents 
as it shows their concerns are taken as seriously as citizens residing 
in the states, and insular area issues are viewed equally significant 
as other issues under the Department's jurisdiction. In your 
reorganization of the Interior Department, will you retain the position 
of Assistant Secretary for Insular Areas?
    Answer. The President nominated Doug Domenech to be Assistant 
Secretary for Insular Areas on June 29, 2017, and Mr. Domenech's 
nomination was confirmed by the Senate on September 13, 2017.
    Question 4. In my reply to your letter soliciting comments to 
assist your review of the Marianas Trench National Monument under 
Executive Order 13792, I wrote about the promises made to the people of 
the Northern Mariana Islands that remain unfulfilled. For years, we 
have been urging Interior to produce the management plan, required when 
President Bush created the Monument. The plan is key to fishing and 
other resource use in the Monument, public education and outreach, and 
the development of a Monument visitors center. Please provide an update 
on any progress and a specific date for issuance of the Monument 
Management Plan the Fish and Wildlife Service has been working on for 8 
years now.
    Answer. FWS continues to work with its partners, including the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. 
Coast Guard, and Department of Defense toward completion of a 
management plan for the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument.
    A number of steps have been taken to address or resolve important 
issues. FWS issued a patent under the Territorial Submerged Lands Act 
for the CNMI's territorial waters in December 2016. This was an 
important step in ensuring that the final monument management plan 
included all applicable jurisdictions and authorities, including that 
of the CNMI. NOAA Fisheries has developed and published fishing 
regulations for the Islands Unit of the Monument. Management 
regulations for the Trench and Volcanic Units were implemented under 
the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, as 
amended, through Department of the Interior Secretarial Order 3284.
    A draft Monument Management Plan and associated Environmental 
Assessment are awaiting completion of the Administration's national 
monuments review and any associated Presidential decision arising from 
the Secretary's recommendations.
    Question 5. The Fish and Wildlife Service requests $470 million--a 
decrease of $13.8 million--for management of National Wildlife Refuges. 
This includes decreases to wildlife and habitat management, visitor 
services, law enforcement, and elimination of funding for refuge 
conservation planning. These cuts will surely ensure that American 
hunters, anglers, and other outdoor enthusiasts will have less access 
to sporting opportunities on public lands. Do you believe the proposed 
funding levels for Refuges are consistent with your vision of 
increasing access to America's public lands, while also managing and 
expanding the Refuge System to protect and enhance America's wildlife 
resources?
    Answer. Yes. Through the National Wildlife Refuge System, the 
Service continues the American tradition, started by President Theodore 
Roosevelt in 1903, to protect fish and wildlife and their habitats and 
to provide recreation opportunities for hunting, fishing and other 
outdoor recreation. The proposed budget makes tough choices that will 
lead to a balanced budget, but maintains a commitment to provide 
outdoor recreational opportunities in both rural and urban or suburban 
settings, as well as to support the vital role of volunteers on our 
Refuges.

    Question 1. Please confirm for me that the contract for Dyke Marsh 
is on track to be awarded before the end of the fiscal year.
    Answer. I am advised that the NPS awarded the contract for 
construction at Dyke Marsh this past fall, but work will probably not 
begin this calendar year since not all permits are yet in hand. 
However, I understand that the construction documents are complete and 
the permit application process is well underway.
    Question 2. I increasingly hear concerns about traffic and traffic 
safety along the GW Parkway.
    2a. Please indicate how the Department tracks usage statistics for 
the Parkway.
    Answer. I understand that there are traffic counters on the roadway 
that track the number of vehicles on the George Washington Memorial 
Parkway (Parkway), trail counters on the Mount Vernon Trail to track 
bicycle and pedestrian usage, and entrance counters at some park sites 
that track vehicles and tour buses.
    2b. Please indicate how the Department tracks accidents along the 
Parkway.
    Answer. The United States Park Police (USPP) utilizes a centralized 
database, the Department's Incident Management, Analysis and Reporting 
System (IMARS), that allows law enforcement officers to electronically 
document accidents/incidents.
    2c. What is the Department doing to increase the safety of the 
parkway? Please speak to the Department's plans for Morningside Lane 
and how it will budget appropriately to be able to address safety 
concerns.
    Answer. The safety of park visitors is of the utmost importance. I 
understand that the NPS has implemented several recommendations from a 
2016 Federal Highway Association safety assessment of Morningside Lane. 
Also, NPS has scheduled an additional study to begin next year to 
identify alternate traffic patterns within the local community to 
increase safety at Morningside Lane.
    2d. What is the Department doing to improve the accuracy of its 
traffic counts?
    Answer. I am told that the NPS is currently assessing equipment 
along the Parkway and working to replace those pieces that are in 
disrepair.
    2e. What is the Department doing to improve how it tracks 
accidents?
    Answer. The USPP continue to work on crash reporting in IMARS. 
Specifically dispatchers are being trained to document detailed 
locations of crashes. This associated with previous improvements should 
allow for more detailed and accurate reporting.
                   Questions Submitted by Rep. Torres
Tribal Concerns:
    Question 1. Mr. Secretary, there has been some disturbing rhetoric 
coming from some members of this Committee, as well as some in the 
Administration, attacking the sovereignty of tribes and questioning the 
recognition process and the land into trust process. Will you reaffirm 
your and the Department's commitment to its trust responsibility to all 
tribes that are currently federally recognized, including the ability 
to take land into trust?
    Answer. I have said before that the importance of my mission as 
Secretary to partner with American Indians and Alaska Natives is one 
that I do not take lightly. Our duty as Americans is to uphold our 
trust responsibilities and consult and collaborate with tribes on a 
government-to-government basis.
    Question 2. To follow up on that, I would like you to address the 
ongoing issue that is the Carcieri decision. That decision has troubled 
Indian Country since it came down 2009, and has left many land 
decisions in limbo. It's been almost 10 years now--do you agree that 
Congress needs to resolve the Carcieri issue once and for all?
    Answer. Congress, as the trust settlor for all Indian Affairs 
matters, has the sole authority to amend existing statutes, such as the 
Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. Congress alone will determine if 
land into trust statutes should be constrained or expanded. The 
Department welcomes the opportunity to work with Congress on any 
recommendations to modernize the land into trust process.
    Question 3. The Tiwahe Initiative has proven to be exceptionally 
successful at assisting tribes in addressing the inter-related problems 
of poverty, violence, substance abuse, and their associated outcomes 
like youth suicide. Tiwahe is currently in its pilot phase and 
impacting 61 tribes directly, with an additional $24 million in Tiwahe 
Social Services and ICWA funds distributed to tribes across the 
country. In spite of this success, Tiwahe is being targeted for 
elimination. Can you tell us if the Department will be able to support 
the Tiwahe Initiative's success through its continued funding?
    Answer. The budget request made difficult choices this year. The 
Department's budget prioritizes self-governance and self-determination, 
and focuses funding in Indian Country on core service activities, fully 
funding the costs for tribes to administer programs for themselves, and 
maintains essential management functions for tribal resources, among 
other things.
    Question 4. I understand that the Native American Graves Protection 
and Repatriation Act Review Committee has been suspended as part of a 
larger review of DOI committees. This is congressionally charted 
committee and does critical work across the country in the rightful 
return of human remains to Indian tribes. Do you have an estimate of 
when the department's review will be completed and the committee re-
activated?
    Answer. In order to make sure all commissions are giving local 
communities adequate opportunities to comment on park management 
decisions, the Department is reviewing the more than 200 boards, 
committees, and commissions under its responsibility. Throughout this 
review process, committees and commissions have been given the option 
to pursue waivers to meet. We recognize the critical work performed by 
these committees.
                  Questions Submitted by Rep. Gallego
Sexual Harassment:
    Question 1. Secretary Zinke, as a follow-up to Mrs. Tsongas' 
questions during the hearing, please address the following. A workforce 
survey on sexual harassment is an important tool available to those 
that are serious about rooting out sexual harassment in their 
organizations. As you alluded to in your testimony, the military has a 
sexual assault and harassment problem of its own. In seeking to address 
this grave and prevalent issue, the military now conducts such a survey 
every other year. Making the surveys recurring is an honest way to 
track progress in eliminating sexual harassment, helps refine 
departmental efforts, and sends a clear signal to employees that sexual 
harassment is a priority.
    With this in mind, will the Department commit to ensuring the 
National Park Service (NPS) performs its survey on a recurring basis?
    Answer. We are mindful of the opportunity to perform this survey on 
a recurring basis and understand the value of doing so. A decision has 
not been made yet on whether to repeat the survey.
    Question 2. In his recent testimony before the Senate, acting NPS 
Director Michael Reynolds said this about the results of the sexual 
harassment workforce survey they are currently conducting: ``I assure 
you that we are committed to transparency and once we receive the final 
data, we will share it widely with this subcommittee as well as all 
employees and interested stakeholders.'' It's a step in the right 
direction but accountability requires true transparency. And true 
transparency means anyone--not just the employees or stakeholders--can 
see the results. Again, the military published the results of its 
survey for all to see.
    In your testimony before the Committee, you indicated your openness 
to sharing the results of both the January 2017 survey and the seasonal 
survey scheduled for July 2017. Please confirm that the Department will 
make both survey results available on the public-facing website.
    Answer. The Department has worked with the NPS to ensure that the 
survey is appropriately shared with stakeholders. The January 2017 
survey results were posted on October 13, 2017, to https://www.nps.gov/
aboutus/transparency-accountability.htm.
    Question 3. You indicated during the hearing that the sexual 
harassment issues known to exist in the National Park Service ``may be 
department-wide.'' Accordingly, and given your stated zero-tolerance 
policy, please explain what efforts you will undertake to expand 
information gathering and response efforts so to include the totality 
of Interior Department personnel.
    Answer. As Secretary of the Interior, I am committed to combating 
all forms of harassment. On April 12, 2017, I issued a memorandum to 
all employees setting forth the Department's policy on harassment. I 
directed the Chief Human Capital Officer and the Solicitor to establish 
additional harassment reporting procedures for managers and 
supervisors. I also ensured that all managers and supervisors 
throughout the Department will now be required to complete training on 
preventing harassment and improving the workplace environment. In 
addition, I have directed the Department to update its policy, 
procedures, and guidance to address the impact of harassment as it 
relates to performance and conduct. This is an important and ongoing 
process here at the Department and I look forward to working with you 
and your colleagues to craft real solutions that protect employees and 
hold wrongdoers accountable.
                  Questions Submitted by Rep. Hanabusa
Hazards Programs:
    Question 1. The U.S. Geological Survey's natural hazards programs 
are critical for communities across our Nation to understand the 
science behind natural disasters and how we can best prepare for them. 
The Earthquake Hazards Program and the Volcano Hazards Program as 
examples today, since they are of particular importance to Hawaii. 
These programs use science and technology to monitor signs of activity 
to help ensure the public is given ample warning of an earthquake, 
tsunami, or volcanic activity, so that proper precautions can be taken 
to reduce the amount of damage and loss of lives.
    Your budget seems to reflect the opposite. On cuts to the 
Earthquake Hazards Program, it says ``This reduction would diminish the 
EHP's ability to execute its core activities . . .'' On cuts in the 
Volcano Hazards Programs, it says ``This reduction would diminish the 
VHP's ability to execute its core activities to provide forecasts and 
warnings of hazardous volcanic activity at volcanoes in the United 
States with the current monitoring networks,'' among other things.
    These proposed cuts are deeply concerning. Although they are not 
large, they could have serious consequences, especially if these cuts 
hinder these programs' abilities to ``execute its core activities.''
    1a. Please explain the rationale behind these proposed cuts.
    Answer. For 2018, the Administration identified areas where the 
Federal Government could reduce spending and also areas for investment, 
such as addressing the maintenance backlog across the National Park 
System and increasing domestic energy production on Federal lands. The 
2018 budget requires restrained spending in order to meet the goal of 
balancing the budget within 10 years. The 2018 budget request focuses 
on core capabilities to provide forecasts and warnings of hazardous 
volcanic activity with current monitoring networks, including Hawaii; 
produce updated hazard assessments for high-threat volcanoes; and to 
revise the national volcano threat level assessment. The budget 
maintains support for robust national and regional earthquake 
monitoring and reporting, including Hawaii.
Invasive Species:
    Question 2. Invasive species is a global problem that will continue 
to invade our lands and waters with devastating economic and ecological 
impacts unless we actively protect our resources. It has been shown 
time and again that prevention of invasive species saves far more money 
than trying to eradicate the pest after it has been introduced. It is 
problematic to cut invasive species funding, seeing as invasive species 
continue to cost the United States more than $120 billion in damages 
annually (Pimental et al. 2005).
    Invasive species management requires a holistic effort due to the 
impacts to both aquatic and terrestrial resources. Especially troubling 
in the budget are reductions for the Fish and Wildlife Service, Office 
of Insular Affairs, and National Parks Service for invasive species 
management, while funding is increased by more than $4.5 million for 
the Bureau of Reclamation, which focuses on dams. While there are 
invasive species in dams, the issues plague areas on both land and in 
the sea. The funding shift away from offices within the Department of 
the Interior that have jurisdiction over areas with invasive species 
and to an agency with little expertise in this area would be an 
inefficient waste of taxpayer money.
    My home state of Hawaii, for example, has very unique ecosystems 
that are particularly vulnerable to invasive species. We require robust 
invasive species funding to prevent further damage from such species as 
the Brown Tree Snake, Little Fire Ant, Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle, and 
the Coqui frog, much of which is best managed by the Fish and Wildlife 
Service.
    2a. Given that the threat from invasive species is not diminished 
and reducing prevention will cost us much more in eradication, can you 
explain the rationale behind cuts to invasive species management?
    2b. How is the Bureau of Reclamation going to effectively manage 
invasive species in places like Hawaii where the Bureau has no 
presence?
    Answer. Invasive species are a significant threat to the Nation's 
economy, food and water security, public health and environment. The 
Department leads extensive work to prevent, eradicate and control 
invasive species, including efforts to strengthen early detection and 
rapid response capabilities, enhance biosecurity measures, and address 
high impact invasive species, such as the brown treesnake. The 
Department is committed to working with the state of Hawaii and all of 
our partners on these important issues. The budget includes $101 
million for invasive species work across the Department, nearly level 
with 2017.
    The Department recently announced approximately $3.5 million 
through the Office of Insular Affairs to continue supporting efforts to 
control the brown treesnake on Guam and prevent its spread to Hawaii, 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the larger 
Micronesian region. This supplements more than $250,000 in brown 
treesnake investments made by the U.S. Geological Survey and the FWS in 
FY 2017. The budget requests an increase for the Bureau of Reclamation 
to help address the threat posed by zebra mussels, which is a serious 
concern in the West due to the experience seen in the Great Lakes 
region.
                  Questions Submitted by Rep. McEachin
Sexual Harassment:
    Question 1. Secretary Zinke, during questioning at the hearing, you 
agreed that your hiring freeze was the reason the DOI attorneys needed 
to work through the backlog of sexual harassment allegations have not 
yet been hired. But you seem to blame others for that. There are only 
two people that can approve exceptions to your hiring freeze; you and 
your Deputy Secretary--or acting Deputy Secretary in this case. There 
are really only two people to blame for the failure to do what it takes 
to work through the backlog. When will those attorneys in the ELLU unit 
be hired?
    Answer. Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. While 
positions in Washington, DC, and Denver, and positions in the field at 
the GS-12 level and above, are still generally subject to hiring 
controls, the Solicitor's Office has authority to hire personnel 
lawyers and is in the process of doing so. I look forward to working 
toward a solution to this problem. As I have stated before, I have a 
zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment and the Department remains 
committed to addressing this issue head on.
    Question 2. Sexual harassment is a sizable, difficult, complex 
problem that requires a serious long-term commitment. A problem like 
that needs a plan with clear goals and a viable path to achieving them. 
I have not found a plan for NPS. I could cobble together the promises 
made in various statements, memos, and briefing notes to see what has 
been said but I have not found a plan. Without a plan, it's hard to 
address the problem efficiently and have accountability for those in 
charge of getting rid of sexual harassment. Is there a written plan for 
how NPS will address its sexual harassment problem?
    Answer. The National Park Service is pursuing a number of proactive 
strategies on multiple fronts to address the harassment issues. First, 
the NPS is examining the breadth and depth of the problems with a 
workplace survey of both permanent and seasonal employees. Second, the 
NPS is encouraging employees to consult with a newly established Ombuds 
Office if they encounter workplace problems. Third, the NPS is 
improving training programs aimed at recognizing and addressing 
harassment. Fourth, the NPS is seeking input from employee resource 
groups. Fifth, the NPS building stronger procedures for reporting, 
investigating, tracking, and resolving work environment issues. And 
sixth, the NPS is acting as quickly as possible when new cases are 
brought to its attention. These issues did not develop overnight and 
they will not be solved overnight, however, NPS is committed to 
bringing a culture of transparency, respect and accountability back to 
the organization.
Inspector General:
    Question 3. Secretary Zinke, would a permanent Inspector General 
help you and your department function more efficiently and 
transparently?
    Answer. The Department appreciates the work of Interior's Office of 
the Inspector General, currently led by the Deputy Inspector General 
Mary L. Kendall, in the detection and investigation of waste, fraud, 
and abuse. I would note that the appointment of an Inspector General is 
a decision to be made by the President, with the advice and consent of 
the Senate.
                   Questions Submitted by Rep. Brown
Environmental Justice:
    Question 1. Mr. Secretary, decades of studies have proved that 
minority, low-income, rural, tribal and indigenous populations face 
tremendous environmental and health disparities. Do you agree?
    Answer. While I am not familiar with the studies you mention, the 
Department of the Interior, and I, recognize that there remain 
impediments to economic, environmental, and health prosperity for a 
significant number of rural and underserved communities. The Department 
supports underserved communities efforts to overcome disparities in 
much of the work we do.
    Programs at the Department of the Interior address issues in Indian 
Country that range from remediation of legacy wells in Alaska, in some 
cases to protect the health and safety of Alaska Native communities, to 
assisting tribes in addressing important human services matters, like 
child welfare, health, and other social services issues.
    Question 2. In 1994 President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 
requiring that the U.S. EPA and other Federal agencies implement 
environmental justice policies. That order required all Federal 
agencies to incorporate environmental justice considerations in their 
missions, develop strategies to address disproportionate impacts to 
minority and low-income people from their activities, and coordinate 
the development of data and research on these topics. Do you support 
the goals of this order?
    Answer. I believe it is necessary that the Department's management 
of the Nation's natural and cultural resources is done in a manner that 
is inclusive of all populations. As I have said before, I recognize 
that the Department has not always stood shoulder-to-shoulder with 
tribal communities. I also recognize that all tribes are sovereign and 
we must respect their right to self-determination and the decisions 
that they make. We are working to foster stronger and more resilient 
Native communities.
    Question 3. Under your budget, this order faces its gravest 
assault. The Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance (OEPC), part 
of the Office of the Secretary, is the focal point for implementing the 
Department's environmental justice policy, including the environmental 
justice executive order, and ensuring compliance. The proposed budget 
would cut the Office of the Secretary--your office--by over 80 percent. 
How can a cut this large not undermine the environment and health of 
minority, low-income, rural Americans, tribal and indigenous 
communities?
    Answer. The request for the Office of the Secretary appears to 
reflect a large reduction because the FY 2018 budget request would 
transfer funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program from 
the Departmental Operations account, from which both FY 2016 andFY 2017 
funding for PILT was appropriated, to a separate PILT appropriation. 
With regard to Indian Affairs programs specifically, while this budget 
makes tough choices, it prioritizes self-governance and self-
determination for Indian Country, fully funding the costs for tribes to 
administer programs for themselves, and maintains essential management 
functions for tribal resources, among other things.
    With regard to environmental justice, while OEPC provides support 
at the Departmental level, implementation of environmental justice 
activities at the Department has always occurred at the bureau level.
                                 ______
    The Chairman. Thank you. I appreciate that. We will start 
with a round of questions and try to get as much as we can in. 
First of all, I remind the Committee members that we have a 5-
minute limit to questions of the Secretary and the staff that 
is here. I am going to do that. I am going to be mean on that, 
so same thing, we will cut you off at 5 minutes. If you are 
talking when it is 5 minutes, I will cut you off. Don't ask a 
question when there are only 20 seconds left. Do it the right 
way.
    I also want to apologize because in the middle of this I 
and Mr. Grijalva have another meeting we are going to have to 
go to. We are not walking out on you, we will be back. If you 
are still here, we will come back.
    Let me open it up and start with questions, if I could, for 
you, Secretary Zinke.
    There are some people, there are some voices out there that 
simply try to measure success by the increased dollars and a 
bigger bureaucracy. As you have mentioned before, that simply 
is a different era. And you have mentioned before how the 
revenues have decreased, how access to public land has been 
further restricted. Overall, a return on services for taxpayers 
has been diminished, even though there was supposedly, on 
paper, an increase in revenues.
    Can you just tell us more clearly how you expect to try to 
solve those three problems of the access, the service, and the 
revenue coming into the country, and how you intend to do that? 
And if there is some way, statutorily, we can assist you in 
hitting those areas?
    Secretary Zinke. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of 
things.
    One, on the revenue side, it is oil and gas and all of the 
above, but I am a Boy Scout. We are going to do it right. You 
leave your campground in as good or better condition than what 
you found it. But clearly, when you put 94 percent of all 
offshore holdings off limits, it has a consequence. When you 
decide you are not going to cut any timber, it has a 
consequence. When you decide you are not going to do anything 
onshore, there is a consequence.
    Compensatory mitigation was a problem. Some people would 
call it extortion. But when you have a project, let's say a 
pipeline or a power line, and you force a company to do $90 
million worth of compensatory mitigation in a project that is 
$109 million, that is a problem. When the permitting process 
becomes arbitrary, that is an issue.
    In the case of North Shore, when a company buys a $3.1 
billion lease offshore, and is forced to go further out in an 
unproductive area, and is forced to drill a well that is not 
proved true because of a Fish and Wildlife rule that is maybe 
pertinent to the Gulf, where you cannot have platforms and 
systems 15 miles apart, that forces them to drill a dry hole, 
that is a $3.1 billion hit, and that sends signals throughout 
the industry that we cannot be trusted.
    So, my biggest job is to be trustworthy, to be a partner, 
making sure we work with people, rather than against people, 
make sure we have a system that we hold industry accountable, 
because accountability is important. That is why we 
reintroduced the Royalty Committee, to make sure we have a 
system that we hold people accountable, but we are viewed as an 
advocate, rather than an adversary.
    Reorganization is not just about number of people in 
budget, it is how we do things. Let me give you an example. If 
you have a trout and a salmon in the same stream, and that 
upstream has perhaps a dam or a lock, and downstream is 
irrigation, and if that stream happens to pass by tribal lands, 
you have at least five different bureaucracies. Fish and 
Wildlife will handle the trout, NOAA will handle the salmon, 
Bureau of Reclamation will handle the irrigation, Army Corps of 
Engineers will handle the locks, and BIA will be the subject 
matter on tribal lands.
    Five bureaus, and it could be more, all will have different 
views, different biological opinions, mind you, and some of the 
opinions might be unreconcilable. So, how do you manage your 
public lands? We are looking at more of a joint model on the 
region side, because if the government cannot align, then how 
do you expect industry, or how do you expect the public to have 
a view and transparency of what is best?
    We are looking at a reorganization based on jointness, 
based on how to get the Forest Service and the Department of 
the Interior together on issues, so we can be more transparent 
and address things like wildlife corridors and watersheds.
    The Chairman. All right, Mr. Secretary, I am cutting myself 
off here, too, so let me thank you for that. That is a 
significant issue.
    Can I just say on Antiquities, very quickly, four of the 
last six presidents have actually changed the way Antiquities 
has been used. In Bears Ears, you were very nice to actually 
challenge Congress to come up and solve some of the questions 
that should be presented. I appreciate that. I know Senators 
Hatch and Lee will take that on the Senate side; the membership 
here will do something with that, we will take upon the 
challenge, and we will give you something legislatively that 
can be used in that particular area.
    I have 9 seconds. I said I wouldn't do a question with that 
period of time, so let me just give it out to you, that if 
there is something that you think we can do to help to assist 
in providing transparency, accountability, dealing with the 
Antiquities Act, we would like to hear from you and are willing 
to do that.
    I apologize, and I will now recognize Mr. Grijalva for his 
questions. Since I went 8 seconds over, we will take it off of 
yours.
    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Grijalva. Mr. Secretary, the Office of Legal Counsel 
within the Department of Justice has a written opinion stating 
fundamentally that only letters or inquiries from committee 
chairmen should receive responses from the Trump 
administration. All other letters from Members of the Congress 
can and have been ignored. We submitted more than a dozen 
letters to the Administration seeking information, and we have 
received no responses.
    I really believe this policy is undemocratic, as well as 
offensive to every Member in Congress. Even Chairman Grassley 
said that it frustrates the constitutional functioning of 
legislature.
    My question is to that issue of information, the flow of 
information, and the equal treatment of Members. Mr. Secretary, 
when you were a member of this Committee, if you wrote a letter 
to the Administration, did you feel your letter deserved to be 
answered?
    Secretary Zinke. Well, first, I can say up front there is 
no gag order.
    And second, I have met with the Minority in person. I also 
recall you were in the meeting that I committed to meet with 
the Minority Members quarterly. And if a Member, which I think 
is a courtesy, it is not a right, but it is a professional 
courtesy, that if you have an issue, then I will give you my 
phone number and we will talk about it personally. I will 
arrange to come over.
    When I was in Boston recently, I called young Joe Kennedy, 
who I think very highly of. I talked to all Members and said 
exactly where I----
    Mr. Grijalva. And I appreciate that, Mr. Secretary, but the 
point here is the free and open flow of information, Members 
receiving information.
    Our oversight responsibility is more encompassing than your 
gesture, and we need information, information that becomes part 
of the record. And while I appreciate the gesture, and would 
take advantage of it, the fact remains that for the record 
these responses need to occur.
    You wrote nine letters to the Obama administration. All 
nine you received responses to when you were a Member of this 
body. And I think that, quite frankly, every Member here, and 
certainly representing the Minority side, deserves the courtesy 
that you were extended by the previous administration.
    The purpose of these letters was to get the reasoning for 
the various policy decisions that you would be making. And I 
really think, and let me ask you, as Members of Congress 
entitled to a full understanding of the reasonings behind your 
policy decisions, don't you think that is part of the 
legislative oversight responsibility that this Committee has?
    Secretary Zinke. I would think hearing it from the 
Secretary of the Interior directly probably is the most 
important access I can think of in a democracy.
    Mr. Grijalva. Let me----
    Secretary Zinke. As you know, when you write a letter, it 
is probably your staff that writes it. It probably comes to my 
staff that answers it. But I have said, and I have absolutely 
committed, that I will talk to you in person. I don't think 
that there is a better system, and I can't remember, and I was 
only here for one term, but I can't remember a Secretary that 
would offer to talk to you about an issue in person.
    Mr. Grijalva. OK. I appreciate that. Let me be very 
specific, though.
    Let's talk about Bears Ears. The comment period is over, 
extended comment period. One of the letters that we sent was 
wanting an accounting, how many support existing monuments, how 
many support making changes to the existing monuments. Will 
your office provide that accounting of those comments as a 
response to that letter? I realize those comments are public, 
but there are tens of thousands of them. We would simply like 
an accounting of the positives and the negatives.
    We are going to be resubmitting letters to you as official 
questions for the record for this hearing. And, as you know, 
questions for the record are technically coming from the 
Chairman. Because of that being on the record, my second 
question, will you commit to providing answers to those letters 
for the record, given the submittal today?
    Secretary Zinke. As you know, the Antiquities Act is 
singular in authority. It is by the President, by the 
executive. It does not require NEPA, it does not require public 
access or public comment.
    Mr. Grijalva. All I want is----
    Secretary Zinke. However, on the review, for the first time 
it was regulations.gov. So, we opened up a website so every 
comment could be heard. And the President asked me to go 
forward and get every comment. And I would certainly----
    The Chairman. I have 10 seconds to finish up with you.
    Secretary Zinke [continuing]. Make that available.
    And if you want to talk about the Bears Ears in the next 
round, I will talk about the Bears Ears----
    Mr. Grijalva. Well, the question was already asked.
    The Chairman. Thank you. I appreciate that.
    Mr. Lamborn, you are up.
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, it is great to have you here. I remember 
when you sat on this side of the dais, and you always had 
great, penetrating questions. And I am so happy to see you 
sitting where you are at now.
    Secretary Zinke. It is easier on that side, but----
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Lamborn. The subcommittee that I chair, the
