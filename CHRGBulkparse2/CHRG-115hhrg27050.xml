   COAST GUARD REQUIREMENTS, PRIORITIES, AND FUTURE ACQUISITION PLANS
                                WITNESS
ADMIRAL PAUL F. ZUKUNFT, COMMANDANT, U.S. COAST GUARD
                           Opening Statements
    Mr. Carter [presiding]. Good morning. Subcommittee will 
come to order. I see that some of our colleagues have a hard 
time getting up in the morning.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. Do we get an award for the ones who came 
in?
    Mr. Carter. Absolutely. Special red star by your name. You 
get to brag. Maybe even a gold--from Baltimore, yes--got up and 
drove here.
    Welcome, to everybody. We are really glad to have you.
    Admiral, we are pleased to have you.
    Here comes brother Cuellar. Sure some others will be here. 
Others will be coming in soon, and I am glad that we have got 
everybody here.
    Admiral Zukunft, we are getting started on another year. We 
are really grateful that you are here this morning to talk to 
us about what is going on with the Coast Guard.
    As you are aware, we are all aware that we don't have our--
have the budget out yet, but we are--because we are on a kind 
of a crammed up schedule to get things done on next year's 
budget--next year's appropriations bills, we thought you cluing 
us in about the needs, we will be able to have a memory of that 
as we get--when we get our budget and then we will come back to 
it and talk about it.
    The Coast Guard has a complex mission requiring significant 
resources including vessels, aircraft, and especially 
personnel. With responsibilities ranging from securing the 
Nation's borders, safeguarding maritime commerce, and ensuring 
environmental stewardship of the U.S. ports and waterways, to 
interdicting drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and 
combating transnational crime, these challenges are diverse and 
require a force that is robust, agile, and well-equipped.
    Congress provided substantial funding in the fiscal year 
2017 omnibus appropriations to improve readiness, recapitalize 
vessels and aircraft, modernize shore facilities, and recruit 
and retain a quality force. The committee is eager to hear from 
you on how you intend to sustain these efforts along with your 
priorities and concerns. I am especially interested in your 
plans to recapitalize the Coast Guard's aging fleet and vessels 
and aircraft.
    With the funding Congress provided in fiscal year 2017 the 
Coast Guard now has four vessel modernization programs 
underway. The NSC and FRC programs are well established. I 
would like to hear the Coast Guard's plans for the polar 
icebreaker and the offshore patrol cutter, as well as plans for 
addressing the remaining vessels in your fleet, many of which 
are past their useful life.
    In addition, in your recent State of the Coast Guard 
address you stated a bigger force is needed. I look forward to 
hearing from you on what is driving the staffing requirements 
and on strategies to fund this growth, especially in light of 
the recapitalization efforts that the Coast Guard will need to 
continue to address in the future budget submissions.
    Although the fiscal year 2018 budget isn't expected until 
next week, unmet needs will remain. The subcommittee will face 
tough decisions to ensure critical priority programs are 
adequately funded and that all funding appropriated is, in 
fact, executable. Your testimony today will help guide this 
committee in making those tough decisions.
    After we receive your budget, I look forward to a candid 
discussion about unmet needs that were not addressed.
    Admiral, every agency is operating in a constrained 
resource environment. However, I believe few can match the 
Coast Guard's consistently excellent performance recruiting and 
maintaining a quality force, sustaining operations with aging 
assets, recapitalizing for the future, and taking care of Coast 
Guard families. This is no easy task.
    I commend the leadership and the Coast Guard men and women 
who serve this Nation so very ably.
    And I also want to take this opportunity to commend 
Commander JoAnn Burdian as she completes her assignment as the 
Coast Guard's liaison to the House of Representatives. I have 
dealt with many liaison officers from our military services as 
chairman of this subcommittee and a member of the Defense 
Appropriations Subcommittee, and I can tell you that Commander 
Burdian is one of the best. An ardent, responsible, and 
trustworthy advocate, she has been invaluable--an invaluable 
asset to the staff and the force multiplier for the Coast 
Guard.
    I and my staff will miss her and wish her well in her next 
assignment, where I know she will continue to serve the Nation 
and the Coast Guard with distinction.
    Before I turn to the admiral for his statement, the text of 
which will be included in the record, I first want to recognize 
my distinguished ranking member, Ms. Roybal-Allard, for any 
remarks she may wish to make.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Welcome, Admiral, to this morning's hearing.
    The Coast Guard has a critical set of missions that we must 
properly support. That is why I was pleased we were able to 
provide funding above the fiscal year 2017 request for the 
Coast Guard, including $233 million above the request for the 
acquisition, construction, and improvements account, which 
funds the recapitalization of the Coast Guard air and marine 
assets; and $92 million above the request for operating 
expenses.
    As was mentioned, we don't currently have any detail on 
what is included in the fiscal year 2018 budget request for the 
Coast Guard. However, with this administration's focus on 
border security we have seen in the ``skinny budget'' the other 
DHS programs are cut.
    With the forthcoming 2018 request in mind, we need to know 
how the Coast Guard is operating and what resources are needed 
to support your important missions, especially for personnel 
and operations.
    I also would like to thank JoAnn Burdian for her hard work 
with the Appropriations Committee on behalf of the Coast Guard 
and the American people and wish her well on her next 
assignment. She will be with us for a little while longer, but 
this is probably our last opportunity to publicly recognize her 
service.
    Thank you again for joining us this morning, Admiral, and I 
look forward to our discussion.
    Mr. Carter. Admiral, before you begin I want to recognize 
your lovely wife here today with us. I have had the pleasure of 
being at your home and also traveling with you, and I know that 
she is the wind beneath your wings. So we are very proud to 
have her here today.
    You may proceed.
    Admiral Zukunft. Good morning, Chairman Carter and Ranking 
Member Roybal-Allard. And first of all, thank you for calling 
out the many accomplishments of JoAnn Burdian. And I will stay; 
she will leave. But we have many great Coastees, and certainly 
many that will be able to fill her place.
    I also want to thank the distinguished members of this 
subcommittee and thank you for the opportunity to speak with 
you today. And especially I thank you for your support of the 
United States Coast Guard. In particular, I appreciate your 
advocacy for the fiscal year 2017 consolidated appropriation as 
it funds key readiness and modernization initiatives and better 
positions us to address today's evolving challenges.
    I ask that my written statement be entered into the record.
    Mr. Carter. It will be.
    Admiral Zukunft. The Coast Guard is first and foremost an 
armed service that advances national security objectives in 
ways that no other armed service can. It begins with our 
authorities that include over 60 bilateral agreements to 
enforce rule of law in the territorial seas and on the high 
seas around the world, and many foreign nations depend on the 
United States Coast Guard to be their maritime law enforcement 
against transnational criminal organizations.
    Applying these authorities, in 2016 we removed a record 201 
metric tons of cocaine and we brought 585 smugglers--these are 
transnational criminals--to justice here in the United States, 
where our prosecution rate is 100 percent. It is less than 10 
percent in their nations of origin.
    And today our greatest challenge in this campaign is really 
one of platforms and people. And we must maintain our current 
pace in recapitalizing the Coast Guard fleet while advancing 
shore-based unmanned aerial systems to enhance our surveillance 
capacity.
    So in 2016 we awarded a contract to complete the buildout 
of our fleet of 58 fast response cutters, all at an affordable 
price, and Bollinger Shipyards delivered the most recent four 
with zero discrepancies. And we awarded the acquisition of the 
first nine offshore patrol cutters to Eastern Shipbuilding 
Group, the down payment for a program of record of 25 of these 
very capable platforms that meet our requirements--and again, 
at an affordable price.
    And we are cutting steel today at Huntington Ingalls 
Shipyard on the ninth national security cutter. We have also 
stood up an integrated program office with the Navy and awarded 
industry studies to commence the buildout of a fleet of three 
heavy and three medium icebreakers--all meaningful steps to 
keep our Nation on an accelerated path to deliver the first 
heavy icebreaker in 2023.
    And we also received our fourth consecutive clean financial 
audit opinion and have minimized acquisition cost growth and 
timeline slippages.
    The Coast Guard is the only armed service that has been 
funded below the Budget Control Act floor in our annualized 
operations and maintenance appropriation. Going forward, we 
will need 5 percent annual growth in our operations and 
maintenance accounts and at least $2 billion for major 
acquisitions to operate and maintain our assets and preserve 
our acquisition programs.
    And I am working to rebuild our long-overlooked inland 
fleet of 35 inland construction tenders with an average age of 
52 years. Now is the critical time in sustaining our inland 
rivers system and overall maritime transportation system that 
contribute $4.5 trillion of commerce on an annual basis. This 
fleet is essential to our economic and our national security.
    And finally, we need to grow the Coast Guard and with 
respect to our most critical asset: our people. Over the next 5 
years we need to restore the 1,100 reserve billets that were 
taken out of circulation as we faced difficult budget 
priorities, and we need to bring on another 5,000 active duty 
members into our service over the next 5 years while sustaining 
our more than 8,500 civil servants.
    This is the direction that the world's best coast guard--
our United States Coast Guard--must steer into the future.
    And so on that note, I sincerely thank the unwavering 
support of this subcommittee to address our most pressing 
needs. With the continued support of the administration and 
Congress, the Coast Guard will remain semper paratus--always 
ready.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look 
forward to your questions.

                  RECAPITALIZATION OF THE COAST GUARD
    Mr. Carter. I thank you, Admiral.
    We are--keep a time clock, but we are going to loosely keep 
the time clock. We are here to get information today.
    I want to start off with something you just mentioned that 
I have been looking at and thinking about. You state the 
recapitalization of the Coast Guard is the highest priority. 
However, many vessels that you operate have reached or 
surpassed their projected service life--the inland cutter fleet 
in particular, which you just mentioned.
    This is so vital to the $4.5 trillion of economic activity 
that occur on our Nation's waterways, and they are in desperate 
need of replacement. Only 10 of the 35 cutters are under 50 
years old, and one that was commissioned in 1944. We don't even 
want to think of how old that is.
    The magnitude of this recapitalization and modernization 
effort will require tradeoffs annually. Beyond the major 
programs like the NSC, the FRC, the OPC, and the polar 
icebreaker, does the Coast Guard have a viable plan to address 
the requirements of this vital but aged fleet, and what 
strategic risk are you taking as a consequence of focusing the 
recapitalization program on the NSC, FRC, and OPC, and the 
icebreaker?
    Admiral Zukunft. Chairman, thank you for that question.
    And this is not a new need, a new requirement. This is one 
that has lingered over time as we looked at other programs, 
other major acquisitions, and we did not want to put those 
acquisition programs at risk.
    But eventually you have to air out your dirty laundry. And 
this is the time to do that. This provides full disclosure of 
what our unmet requirements are.
    As we build out the national security cutter, actually the 
ninth national security cutter will cost less than the sixth. 
As we look at keeping a hot product line going and then 
realizing economies of scale, the cost of those are coming 
down.
    The fast response cutters are now coming out with zero 
discrepancies. So with mature product lines we are driving down 
costs and then holding requirements steady.
    We have already reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers 
in looking for a commercial off-the-shelf design for an N-1 
tender that can be modified depending on where it is going to 
be operating but would have the same engines, basically the 
same design, and can be built for roughly about $25 million a 
copy in a commercial shipyard here in the United States, which 
would also stimulate job growth, as well.
    When you actually go down to the waterfront and you go on 
this--the Coast Guard cutter Smilax, which is, in fact, 73 
years old, the first thing you notice are there are no women 
assigned to it because these ships were not designed for mixed-
gender crews back in the 1940s. We have done a lot of lead and 
asbestos mitigation to make sure that these are still safe to, 
you know--are habitable, and if they are not we take them out 
of service.
    But at the end of the day, I mean, this is what maintains 
our infrastructure, our inland waterway system. And through 
that waterway that connects the deep-water ports are over $4.5 
trillion of commerce each and every year.
    The heartland of the United State are maritime states in 
the true sense--Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Illinois, and so on 
down the upper Mississippi River, lower Mississippi River. When 
you look at the latticework of waterways that we have and what 
the--what burden that takes off our other highways, it really 
is what I would call geographic envy to any other Nation that 
looks at our geography, but again, maintained by this fledgling 
fleet of 35 ships. The time to replace them have arrived.
    Mr. Carter. One other quick question: In your State of the 
Coast Guard address you stated that emerging global threats 
warranted an increase in the NSC program from eight to nine 
ships. There is no question the national security cutter is a 
tremendous asset, performing well above expectations. It is, 
however, one of the many tools in the toolkit that the Coast 
Guard needs to successfully execute its complex and diverse 
missions.
    Funding a capital ship like the NSC is expensive. As you 
know, we will be faced with a budget decision to include 
production funding for a 10th NSC in the fiscal year 2018 
budget. Will adding more NSCs and reducing or foregoing other 
recapitalization efforts like the OPC, FRC, and inland cutters 
better serve the Coast Guard?
    Admiral, let me ask you today, as I will ask the secretary 
next week, does the Coast Guard need more national security 
cutters to execute its 11 statutory missions? Will the 10th 
cutter endanger other priority recapitalization programs like 
the offshore patrol cutter, the fast response cutter, or the 
polar icebreaker? Please be specific.
    Admiral Zukunft. Thank you, Chairman. And I have gone on 
record in the past when we laid out our program of record for 
eight national security cutters, with our biggest concern being 
any additional growth, what risk that would impinge upon the 
buildout of the offshore patrol cutter.
    What we received was topline relief to build a ninth 
national security cutter with long lead-time materials. In 
fact, that ship is under construction right now.
    Will we put that ship to use? Absolutely. In fact, today 
one of our national security cutters, the Hamilton--she is 
still in her first year of service--will be returning to port 
with 17 metric tons of cocaine. In fact, there are 27 metric 
tons of cocaine on Coast Guard cutters today.
    So when we looked at what our requirements were for our 
entire fleet, our full program of record, we didn't have global 
refugee flows, we did not have trafficking activity, we weren't 
addressing the nine-dash line, and we weren't addressing 
potential conflict with North Korea. So the world has changed 
at a much more accelerated pace since we built out this program 
of record.
    But I will be specific. The offshore patrol cutter is our 
number one priority in recapitalizing our legacy fleet of 
today.
    A 10th national security cutter, yes, if that is funded 
upon the top line will I put it to use? Absolutely.
    But we need to look at what the follow on, the out-year 
costs are, as well--not just the initial acquisition but, as I 
mentioned earlier, it is our annualized operating and 
maintenance funding. That needs to be built into this 
algorithm, as well--not just acquisition, but the sustainment 
piece of that, as well.
    Mr. Carter. And I agree with that.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. This review will lead to a permanent end 
to live tissue training.
    Can you tell me how the review will proceed, what will be 
examined, and if experts from within our outside of the Coast 
Guard will be used?
    Admiral Zukunft. Ranking Member, this will in all 
likelihood be a contract service, just as the legacy live 
tissue training was. And like you, I found that, quite 
honestly, abhorrent, in terms of meeting our mission 
requirements.
    So we will move to a simulation. It may be more expensive, 
but for us it will be the right thing to do to prepare our 
Coast Guard members who may be deployed to theaters where they 
may encounter traumatic injuries.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Okay. I believe there is some evidence, 
however, that it is cheaper to do it this way, so I am hoping 
that that will be true.
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes, ma'am. And again, I look at this as 
the right thing to do.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Thank you.
                             CYBER SECURITY
    This past week we saw the devastating effects of a 
cyberattack involving ransomware across many countries, and the 
news has reported that over 100,000 organizations have been 
affected in 150 countries. As vital physical infrastructure is 
increasingly dependent on the Internet, the potential damage of 
these attacks increases significantly.
    The Coast Guard is responsible for cybersecurity for one 
such piece of infrastructure, and that is, you know, the ports. 
What would be the impact of such an attack to the movement of 
commerce, and what would be the impact of a delay in operations 
mean to commerce if the ports were to shut down even for an 
hour or a day?
    Admiral Zukunft. Ranking Member, this probably goes back to 
2014 when there was a work delay on the West Coast as the 
longshoreman workers were revisiting their contract renewal for 
5 years. When I went out there I flew over the ports of L.A. 
Long Beach and I counted over 70 fully laden container ships 
anchored offshore because they could not engage in commerce.
    That immediately impacts the Rust Belt, the manufacturing 
floors. It affects the stocking in major distributors. We live 
in a just-in-time environment. The daily cost is over $1 
billion a day, and then the jobs that get added onto that, as 
well.
    This was a man-made disruption. The very same thing can 
happen because about 90-plus percent of our ports are fully 
automated. They have taken the human out of the equation, if 
you will, so everything from cargo manifests to actually moving 
and then forwarding that container, as well.
    So industry is turning to the Coast Guard in terms of what 
are the, you know, the national standards, if you will, for 
cybersecurity.
    I am engaged personally with the international maritime 
organizations. We just don't look at the United States; we need 
to look at the entire international global supply chain, and 
then how do we codify and then share best practices 
internationally?
    And so we find the Coast Guard drawn more and more in in 
terms of being, in terms of a sector, maritime--to be, you 
know, the oversight, if you will--not a regulatory but, you 
know, disseminating best practices in terms of how can we 
prevent a cyber intrusion, and then also turning to industry to 
report to us so that we know that there has been an intrusion 
in case this is a coordinated effort to disrupt our supply 
chain.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. And how is the coordination between the 
ports and the Coast Guard working with regards to 
cybersecurity?
    Admiral Zukunft. We have 37 area maritime security 
committees at all of our major ports, and within these 
committees we have subcommittees that are strictly addressing 
cybersecurity. Right now it is not built into the Maritime 
Transportation Security Act. That addresses fences and access 
but it doesn't address indirect access via the Internet.
    So we are working--collaborating with the many port 
stakeholders through these area maritime security committees 
looking for best practices. I am encouraged by what I have seen 
at Long Beach container terminals. They have nearly fully 
automated that port facility right down to autonomous vehicles 
that move containers--battery-powered, no carbon footprint 
whatsoever. But they built cybersecurity into the forefront of 
that.
    And how do you migrate that best practice for others? There 
is a real cost involved in doing this so I think the other 
piece of that is, you know, is the cost aspect. The cost of a 
disruption would be ruinous to our economy.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you.
    Mr. Fleischmann.
    Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you.
    Oh, I am sorry.
    Mr. Carter. Yes. Let's remember to turn the mikes on.
                           MARINE INSPECTORS
    Mr. Fleischmann. Yes. Thank you. My apologies.
    Admiral, again, I want to thank you and the President. I 
saw the Coast Guard graduation yesterday. I have had the 
privilege of nominating--trying to get some folks in the Coast 
Guard Academy. We have a proud tradition in Tennessee of Coast 
Guard personnel.
    Specifically, I did want to thank Master Chief Shawn 
McMahon and Wicheta. They are doing wonderful work in 
Chattanooga. They are omnipresent and we thank you for them, as 
well, sir.
    I have been hearing lately that there is a potential 
shortage of Coast Guard marine inspectors. With that in mind, 
would you briefly touch on three things, sir: the importance--
the important work that the marine inspectors do to facilitate 
commerce, what a lack of marine inspectors will mean to your 
inland waterway mission, and what has led to this problem and 
what might our subcommittee do to combat it, sir.
    Admiral Zukunft. Well, I think the biggest--Congressman, 
the biggest challenge to our marine inspection program is 
subchapter M, which now brings over 6,000 what had been 
uninspected towing vessels under an inspection regime. And this 
was brought on by just a spate of casualties.
    There are several alternatives that an operator may use. 
They may wish to have a Coast Guard inspector or they may want 
to have a third party do the inspection on behalf of the Coast 
Guard. We call it an alternative compliance program.
    I have come to the realization that we need to overhaul our 
alternative compliance program and provide more stringent 
oversight of these third parties doing inspection work on 
behalf of the Coast Guard. We have seen a number of casualties 
where third parties did not go to the level of detail that the 
United States Coast Guard would in finding safety--flagrant 
safety violations, and perhaps maybe that is why an operator 
uses a third party and not the Coast Guard, because we will 
write them up and make sure they fix it.
    So we need to provide better oversight, and at the same 
time we may incur, you know, a larger share of this new fleet 
of ships that will come under an inspection regime.
    The other part is we need to get after shipbuilding here in 
the United States, as well. When we look at the status of our 
prepositioned fleet, those that would provide sealift during a 
campaign, many of these are 20, 25-year-old steamships. In 
fact, there are very few licensed engineers that have steamship 
qualifications today.
    And we only have about 78 prepositioned ships, you know, 
and if you look back to World War II the highest casualty rate 
was in our merchant marine. So if you think that there will be 
no casualties if we find ourselves in a campaign--a 
traditional, conventional campaign, whether it is Europe, North 
Korea, or the like--there are a lot of submarines out there 
that will take these ships out.
    So we need to be thinking about what is our ability to 
recapitalize our merchant marine fleet. And if we do, that 
requires marine inspectors, as well.
    We are on the, I would say, the fast lane to being a net 
export nation of fossil fuel.
    Mr. Fleischmann. Yes.
    Admiral Zukunft. And if there were a provision that would 
say a certain percentage of those ships have to be U.S.-flagged 
ships, whether it is carrying LNG or U.S. crude, that might 
spark another increase in the shipbuilding industry.
    We have three Jones Act deep draft shipyards in the United 
States today. Certainly they would be interested. This would 
certainly stimulate economic development with jobs. But, you 
know, I don't want to be the ones holding them up because I 
don't have enough marine inspectors.
    So whether it is uninspected towing vessels, national 
security, or international commerce, those are three areas that 
I see right now a growth--foreseeable growth requirement for 
our marine inspection program.
    Mr. Fleischmann. Yes, sir.
    Admiral Zukunft. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Fleischmann. Well, thank you, sir.
    And I will end by just inviting you next week--I am sorry, 
next year is Coast Guard year in Chattanooga. We honor all five 
branches and we would like to invite you to Chattanooga on May 
the 4th. We have had the commandant of the Marine Corps; we 
have had the CNO down. So I will extend that invitation to you, 
as head of the great United States Coast Guard, sir.
    Admiral Zukunft. Four May. I have the date. Thank you, 
Congressman.
    Mr. Fleischmann. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Carter. Mr. Cuellar.
                          PRODUCTION SCHEDULE
    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And I also saw the graduation last night and--yesterday 
afternoon, should I say--and very good speech that you gave, so 
thank you so much.
    I want to follow up on a couple of items that you 
mentioned.
    First, the offshore patrol cutter project: How is that 
coming? I mean, do you feel confident that it will be on--the 
production will be on schedule? Any particular things you see 
in the way or will they be on schedule?
    Admiral Zukunft. Congressman, we are on target and 
tracking. And first of all, I have to thank this committee, as 
we awarded final design to award the contract back in 
September.
    We did have to move some money around to make that happen. 
The 2017 budget, it puts the long lead-time materials in place.
    I have been down to Eastern Shipbuilding Group and they are 
ready to cut steel to put that first ship in the water in the 
year 2021. So I am very confident that they will deliver a top-
quality product on budget and on time.
                               ICEBREAKER
    Mr. Cuellar. Okay.
    On a second subject that you mentioned, the icebreakers, I 
just got back on a CODEL to the Arctic Circle. Secretary 
Tillerson was there and I asked him a question about the 
icebreakers because, as you know, when you have the Russians up 
there and other folks you are talking about shipping lanes that 
are important, then you are talking about the natural 
resources--oil, gas--resources that you have there.
    And I think the Russians have over 50 icebreakers. I think 
that is what one of the briefings told us there. And I think we 
have, what, two or three--one working partially?
    Admiral Zukunft. We have two.
    Mr. Cuellar. Two. Two, but the second--is the second one 
working? There is only one working, or they are both working?
    Admiral Zukunft. So the third one is actually deactivated.
    Mr. Cuellar. Deactivated. So there are two working built in 
the 1970s?
    Admiral Zukunft. The oldest was built in the 1970s. The 
Healy is--was built around the year 2000, so relatively new 
compared to the Polar Star.
    Mr. Cuellar. All right. So you mentioned the next one is 
coming for us 2023. Could you just expand a little bit on the 
icebreakers for the Arctic Circle?
    Admiral Zukunft. Thank you, Congressman. So we chartered a 
study about 5 years ago to look at, you know, what are the 
national requirements for access in the high latitudes. This 
was done through a third party and we went back and revisited 
it a number of times, and at the end of it the minimum 
requirement was three heavy and three medium icebreakers.
    If you use the, you know, a carrier--an aircraft carrier as 
kind of the model, and if you need an aircraft carrier, say, in 
the Pacific, well you really need three to keep one there 
permanently. One is in maintenance; one is, you know, ramping 
up to get ready; and the other one is deployed for 6 to 8 
months at a time. So it takes three to make one, which is how 
we got to three and three if we need permanent presence north 
and south, or even more so.
    Then we started looking at now what has changed in the 
Arctic since the study was done. Well, the ice has retreated at 
record rates.
    About 13 percent of the world's oil reserves and about a 
third of the world's gas reserves are in the Arctic right now--
and I say ``reserves'' because it is not profitable right now 
to do offshore drilling up there, but out of that about half of 
this is in the U.S. EEZ and in our extended continental shelf. 
And so we have sovereign interest at stake up there, as well.
    We have seen China, for example, with their icebreaker 
doing annualized studies in what I would call our extended 
continental shelf. Put it in perspective, that area is the size 
of the state of Texas. It is enormous.
    But we have not ratified the Law of the Sea Convention so 
it is treated right now as the global common. So if some point 
in the future we ratify the Law of the Sea, we stake our claim, 
I would be naive to think that claim would not be challenged by 
others who claim they have operated there repeatedly and this 
is now global commons, and the next thing we know we see a 
Chinese mobile offshore drilling unit going into the, you know, 
extended continental shelf to extract what otherwise would be 
U.S. oil.
    We see Russia--with their 40 right now, but they are still 
building their fleet out--prepared to deliver two icebreaking 
corvettes that will carry cruise missiles in the year 2020.
    We have sat down with the Navy and we created what is 
called a cooperative strategy for the 21st century. And we look 
at the Arctic. The Navy says, ``Coast Guard, you have got the 
Arctic.''
    So as we look at, you know, who has, you know, sole 
responsibility for exercising sovereignty in the Arctic region, 
it is the United States Coast Guard. So that gets us to a point 
of why we need national assets--icebreakers--to exert 
sovereignty there.
    And right now we are trying to do it with a ship that is 40 
years old. It is literally on life support, which is why we are 
going to accelerate the delivery of this first icebreaker. We 
will need another one right behind that so we can deactivate 
that. We have put a lot of maintenance money into this old ship 
but it is the only heavy icebreaker in our Nation's inventory 
today.
    Mr. Cuellar. My time is up, but I just want to say I 
appreciate the strategy because we don't pay a lot of attention 
to the Arctic, but once you get there and you get the briefings 
and you understand and you see what the Russians and the 
Chinese--I forgot the Chinese, also--and because of the 
reserves that we have there and because of the shipping lane 
and because of the military bases that the Russians are 
building there aggressively, I think it is something that we 
need to start looking. I appreciate your leadership on that.
    Admiral Zukunft. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you.
    Mr. Carter. Admiral, when David was chairman of this 
subcommittee we went to Alaska--what would that have been, 6 or 
8----
    Mr. Price. Probably 9 or 10.
    Mr. Carter. Okay, 9 or 10. My wife learned that Coast Guard 
needed a icebreaker and she has been bugging me about that 
icebreaker ever since. And yesterday when the President 
mentioned it in his speech at the graduation she called me in 
the middle of another meeting to inform me that the President 
said he is going to give them an icebreaker.
    You have got the best lobbyist, as far as I am concerned, 
in--for me in this committee of anybody in the country.
    Mr. Palazzo.
                              SURVEILLANCE
    Mr. Palazzo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Admiral, it is great to see you again. Really enjoyed 
seeing you in Pascagoula, Mississippi for the christening of 
the Kimball this past March and look forward to several more 
christenings of the national security cutters.
    And I just want the thank you and your men and women that 
work for you for everything that they do protecting our 
maritime security as well as keeping the drugs off the streets 
and out of the hands of our children and our communities. That 
is an extremely important mission. Thank you for doing that.
    My question is $18 million is going into research and 
development for a shore-based long-range UAS. Can you tell me a 
little bit more about the program and the timeline for 
delivery?
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes. Thank you, Congressman.
    So we have talked a lot about recapitalizing ships, which 
are long overdue. But the reason we are having so much success 
right now in the transit zone is, one, you know, the 
intelligence is really good; and two, the surveillance is good.
    But we have not addressed what are we doing to keep pace 
with surveillance as we increase our presence on the water, and 
then how can you do that more effectively and efficiently? And 
so we were a little bit late to the game getting into the land-
based unmanned aerial system.
    Within the Department of Homeland Security, within the--
within Customs and Border Protection there is a squadron of 
nine Guardian UAVs built by General Atomics. We have Coast 
Guard members detailed to CBP to operate these remote systems, 
but they are really, you know land border-focused and so we 
really haven't addressed the maritime domain, as well.
    And so with this $18 million it is really working within 
the Department of Homeland Security, so we have a unified 
requirement that we can leverage, you know, what DOD is 
building. We are not putting Hellfire missiles on these; these 
are strictly surveillance platforms. But what can we--what are 
the state-of-the-art systems in the maritime that can look 
through cloud cover, that can work at extended ranges?
    Right now the go-fast activity--I was at Tampa, Florida 
talking to our folks at Panama Express, and the go-fasts now 
are heading south from Colombia off the coast of Ecuador out of 
range right now of our surveillance platforms that are pre-
staged in Comalapa, El Salvador. So they are going beyond where 
we can reach, so we are not getting to a point we can't reach 
and touch them until they come further north. So they are 
gaming our lack of surveillance capabilities.
    So the $18 million gets after, you know, the state-of-the-
art sensor packages, the range that would be needed, and the 
operating systems to operate these platforms at extended 
ranges--not from the United States, but really closer to where 
the threat is, miles and miles before those threats arrive in 
the United States, to stage those out of places in the 
Caribbean or perhaps in the Eastern Pacific to address these 
threats that are ultimately destined for the United States.
                               JONES ACT
    Mr. Palazzo. All right. Thank you for that.
    You also mentioned earlier--we discussed the Jones Act a 
little bit. Can you tell me a little what the Coast Guard's 
enforcement role is and perhaps why the Jones Act is extremely 
important to keeping the U.S. maritime industry strong?
    Admiral Zukunft. Well, absolutely. And, Congressman, I 
think as you well know, we only--today we have three Jones Act 
deep-water ports in the United States: Philadelphia Shipyard, 
Halter Marine in Pascagoula, and then NASSCO Shipyard in San 
Diego.
    If the Jones Act goes away, all U.S.-flagged ships will be 
built overseas and then those shipyards will shut down. Not 
only do the shipyards shut down, the expertise goes with it, as 
well.
    And so what if all those shipyards move to, say, South 
Korea? And now what if we find ourselves in a conflict in that 
region and we are now dependent for an overseas shipyard in 
conflict to deliver ships for the United States?
    We didn't do that during World War II. I think we can learn 
a lot from history and not make what I would consider 
shortsighted calculations that would have strategic 
consequences in the long run. Obviously, with that comes our 
U.S. mariners, as well.
    So for me, you know, it is job creation, it is about 
national security, and it is a workforce that we need to have 
at the ready if we do find ourselves in a global conflict. I 
look around the world today and I am not seeing tranquility 
break out anywhere. I would like to see it somewhere, but it is 
just not breaking out.
    A lot of pressure on our military forces today in terms of 
how do we balance diplomacy? If that fails, you know, what are 
the military consequences as a result of that?
    Jones Act is a big part of that.
    Mr. Palazzo. Admiral, thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Carter. Okay, Mr. Ruppersberger.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. First thing, thank you for being here. I 
never realized how good the Coast Guard was until I came to 
Congress. I remember I was in the Port of Baltimore, and Judge 
Carter and I sit on the Defense Preparations and we do the 
budget for Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. And what you all 
do with what you have is just incredible, in my opinion.
    I think semper paratus--what does that mean?
    Admiral Zukunft. Always ready.
                 ARCTIC MILITARY PRESENCE AND COMMERCE
    Mr. Ruppersberger. Always ready. And if you look at what 
your missions are with drug interdiction, working with ports, 
you know, doing all the search and rescue, it is just amazing.
    When you are one of the last ones to ask questions a lot of 
this has been addressed, but I want to prioritize on the area 
of the Arctic again. And I think it is really important that we 
deal with this because I think that maybe because it is so far 
away or whatever, but we have serious issues because, in my 
opinion, more than anything is the Russian aggression. Anything 
having to do with Putin we have gotta be concerned. And you 
also mentioned the China issue.
    And right now I think Putin has 40 active polar icebreakers 
in the Arctic while the United States has two, with the Polar 
Star being commissioned over 40 years. And there are a lot of 
issues we have to deal with there.
    Recently the Russians have made a number of aggressive 
moves in the region, and that includes dispatching numerous 
military brigades, planning a large ship--shipping port in 
Siberia's Yamal Peninsula, and also rebuilding old airbases. 
U.S. presence--and one--I am sure one of the issues not only 
from a dominance point of view but also because of the 
resources that are going to be there, as far as oil.
    U.S. presence in the Arctic is necessary for more than just 
power projection; it is a matter of national security. If 
remain unchecked, the Russians will extend their sphere of 
influence to over 5 million square miles of Arctic ice and 
water.
    Now, climate change is melting ice in the Arctic at an 
alarming rate, and as a result, more waterways are becoming 
navigable. It is essential that the United State be ready to 
assist any uptick in Arctic commerce. There is a vast amount of 
natural resources which we can extract, including large gas and 
oil reserves. And simply put, if our waterways are not cleared, 
we cannot capitalize on this resource.
    Now, in a GAO report I read that several years ago the 
Coast Guard was unable to provide year-round access to the 
Arctic in 2011 and 2012 and the Coast Guard could not meet four 
of 11 total requests for icebreaking services.
    My questions: First, how many medium and heavy polar 
cutters do you need to completely manage increasing traffic in 
the Arctic?
    I got a couple more.
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes. Yes, Congressman, you know, in the 
current state of affairs right now, you know, the six 
icebreakers, three heavy and three medium icebreakers, would 
satisfy those requirements. You know, that is based on what the 
threat environment is in 2017.
    Now, these ships will be in service for 30-plus years. As 
we build those, as we have seen with our program of record with 
the national security cutter, the offshore patrol cutter, the 
world changes.
    And so what if the world does change? The advantage you 
have when you are building national security cutters and now 
you are making these more affordable in the long run, you have 
a hot production line, maybe, you know, 10, 12 years from now 
the world changes but at least you are producing these at an 
affordable price, a predictable price, and on schedule.
    There may be a change, but at least as we see the world 
right now, you know, the three heavy and three medium would 
meet today's requirements based on the threats that we see----
    Mr. Ruppersberger. Including the Russian dominance there?
    Admiral Zukunft. With the Russian dominance.
    We need to look differently, though, at what an icebreaker 
does. We need to reserve space, weight, and power if we need to 
strap on a cruise ship missile package on it.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. Well, that is an issue. That and maybe 
intelligence utilities, those type of things. But----
    Admiral Zukunft. Right.
    Mr. Ruppersberger [continuing]. Let me ask you this: I see 
Russia as a serious threat and we have to deal with it. So in 
the current icebreaking capabilities, would the Navy be able to 
conduct a full-scale defense of Alaska in the event of real 
threat to our homeland, based on what we have just talked about 
here with Russia?
    Admiral Zukunft. I probably won't speculate on what the 
Navy, you know, can or cannot do. Obviously we have the 
world's----
    Mr. Ruppersberger. We need to plan for that.
    Admiral Zukunft [continuing]. Best Navy. But our 
cooperative strategy, right now we--you know, you don't see the 
Arctic addressed, you know, in our national military strategy 
as a strategic region, so that is why as I look at where the 
other services are operating, where are they not operating? 
Which is why I am focused on the Arctic, which is why I am 
focused on the Western Hemisphere.
    We are a military service, and so we need to double down 
where the other services are pulled off to North Korea, Russia, 
China, Iran, violent extremism.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. Probably many countries, including 
Russia, laid claims to portions of the Arctic territory. If 
tensions rise does the Coast Guard have the capability to 
firmly defend our geopolitical interests?
    Admiral Zukunft. Congressman, I would say it is seasonal, 
and for the Navy it would be seasonal--seasonal by virtue of 
the fact that our fleet of today, our offensive capability can 
only access those waters when they are ice-free, and they are 
not always ice-free.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. Well, it is something I think we really 
need to prioritize. I think it is really important. In this 
business of politics it is important you listen to your wife, 
so I would suggest that this committee and the chairman really 
listen to his wife and that we really make this a priority on 
where we are going. So----
    Admiral Zukunft. Congressman, thank you.
    And again, I want to thank this committee because this is 
the committee that has really moved this, you know, from the 
starting block to down the track. The $150 million that we have 
moved out of the 2017 appropriation that you put there gets us 
out of the starting block.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. The other thing I want to say, too, if 
you are a female member of Congress you need to listen to your 
husband.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Who happens to be a Marine. [Laughter.]
    Mr. Ruppersberger. I know. I work out with him in the gym 
sometimes so I see him.
    Mr. Carter. You finished?
    Mr. Ruppersberger. Oh, I am finished. Thank you. I yield 
back.
    Mr. Carter. I definitely ought to listen.
    Mr. Taylor.
    Mr. Taylor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And, Admiral, thank you for being here today. Really 
appreciate it, everything that you guys do in your service. And 
I know the Coast Guard is a great bang for the buck, if you 
will, and certainly in my opinion a fundamental part of our 
national security apparatus, and I really appreciate what you 
do.
    A couple quick things. Actually, I just want to just follow 
up one thing on--that Representative Ruppersberger just said 
about defending sovereignty in the Arctic. I know that he did 
ask in terms of the Coast Guard's capability to do so in the 
face of Russian movements, Russian aggression, and stuff like 
that.
    Can you just repeat that if you will? Do you believe that 
the Coast Guard currently has the capability to be able to deal 
with that potential threat? And also, is there a strategy in 
place now that can actually with the Navy to be able to do it 
if you need more backup, if you will?
    Admiral Zukunft. I will first talk about the strategy and I 
will go back to our cooperative strategy for the 21st century, 
which is signed by the CNO, myself, and then the commandant of 
the Marine Corps. And so what it does, it looks at what your 
inventory is of assets and then it looks at where you employ 
those.
    And so when you start looking at the Arctic on the surface, 
you know, that is where you will find the Coast Guard. Are we 
ready to go toe-to-toe with a Russian combatant with a national 
security cutter? Our capabilities on the national security 
cutter are more defensive than they are offensive, so as 
currently equipped, you know, that platform is not ready to 
engage in what I would call traditional naval warfare.
    The Navy certainly has a fairly robust submarine fleet, and 
so if nothing else that would keep an adversary guessing. And 
our Navy has operated in the Arctic for some period of time. So 
in terms of an offensive capability, it would be less surface 
and it would be more subsurface.
    But how might this play out? I mean, do we immediately 
jump, you know, to armed conflict, or does it begin with the 
fact that Russia has already claimed most of the Arctic, you 
know, up to and including the North Pole? And now they start 
extracting resources, or they move fishing vessels in there, 
and we say, ``Well, wait a minute. That is not yours.''
    And so initially the conflict or the tensions, as we see in 
the nine-dash line and the east South China Sea, it doesn't 
quite approach armed conflict; it is something less than, but 
if you don't have an ability to exert sovereignty then they are 
going to fill that vacuum. So I think that presence piece--it 
is not presence, but it is really posturing to say, ``Hey, this 
is our sovereign interest. Keep out.''
    And so I think that is really the strategic way forward.
    Mr. Taylor. Got you. So look at international law first, 
maritime law first, and go that route, and then--but backed up 
with a presence.
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes, sir.
                             CYBER ATTACKS
    Mr. Taylor. If I can switch gears just really quickly on 
the cyber, have you guys--have you seen an increase in attacks? 
And is there currently--and I have asked this question at a 
couple other hearings, as well, too--are there currently data-
sharing on attacks to be able to establish a pattern or 
potential attribution to state sponsors, potentially, or 
others, and then also for best practices?
    So again, are there--are you seeing an uptick in attacks? 
Is there a sharing apparatus between agencies and even military 
services to be able to find patterns?
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes, sir. I would say the--pattern is 
persistent.
    You know, we operate on the Department of Defense 
information network. And in fact, the J-6 for the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff is a Coast Guard three-star admiral.
    The chairman of the Joint Chiefs brought this individual in 
and he says, ``Well, we, military, just operate on the dot-mil 
domain. The Coast Guard operates the full spectrum: dot-gov, 
dot-com, dot-mil. And so we really need to bring a Coast Guard 
three-star who we created to fill this position because we 
can't just insulate ourselves within the dot-mil domain.''
    We also helped staff the Department of Homeland Security's 
NCIC, which does the interagency piece.
    And the 2017 budget actually finally provides us the 
billeting to establish a program of record, because up until 
now we had been a volunteer fire department in cyber, pulling 
people off of other primary jobs to do cyber work. So now we 
can finally build out a program of record, the professionals 
who will be doing cyber full time. Two graduates, two brand new 
ensigns that graduated yesterday, they are going straight into 
cyber.
    We have a shortage of about 209,000 cyber professionals in 
the United States today, so to think we can bring these in off 
the street, we are going to have to grow it our own. So there 
is a human capital piece that goes with this, as well.
    And I want to thank this committee for allowing us to go 
from a volunteer fire department to a professional service when 
it comes to cyber.
    Mr. Taylor. I have got more, but I am--I won't hold all the 
time.
    Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Carter. Mr. Price.
    Mr. Taylor. Thank you, Admiral.
    Mr. Price. Admiral, let me welcome you back to the 
committee and thank you for helping us schedule this early 
morning--I want to briefly ask you about a backward-looking 
budget item, which probably left some needs unmet, realizing 
that we don't have the figures for the----
    Mr. Carter. Turn your mike on.
                            DISASTER RELIEF
    Mr. Price [continuing]. Realizing we don't have the figures 
for the coming year. Has to do with Hurricane Matthew, which, 
as you know, had a devastating effect on our region. And I know 
several Coast Guard units along the east coast from Florida to 
Virginia were damaged in the hurricane.
    Coast Guard had estimated operational impact--an impact on 
the crews who have to work on overtime to be something like $92 
million. That was the estimate. Congress did not appropriate 
funds for Coast Guard recovery in the December emergency 
supplemental, but we did provide $15 million to begin repairs 
on facilities in the April omnibus bill.
    So can you provide us a status update on the east coast 
units' recover? And is it fair to say there is still a $77 
million worth of need today?
    Admiral Zukunft. Congressman, yes, we still have a $77 
million hole. The $15 million from Station Tybee, which is 
right outside of Savannah, Georgia; Cape Canaveral; Ponce 
Inlet--those were probably the most seriously impacted units 
from Hurricane Matthew. Their piers were destroyed. Right now a 
lot of these units are operating out of portable trailers. That 
is where the $77 million, the brick and mortar to reconstitute 
those stations, would go to.
    But what the $15 million does do is it at least allows us 
to sustain operations as on June 1st we start a whole 'nother 
hurricane season all over again. And then we also enter into 
what I would consider our peak search and rescue period, as 
well. So the $15 million at least keeps us in business, but not 
in the ideal state, but as good Coasties we will be semper 
paratus.
    Mr. Price. I am sure that is true. I also infer from what 
you said that this cost estimate remains valid, as to what is 
still required.
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes, sir.
                            BORDER SECURITY
    Mr. Price. Let me move to an important question of border 
security, very much in our discussion and debate these days. 
President has asked for additional resources to construct a 
physical wall along the southern border, as you well know.
    It seems to be a well-kept secret that Congress built 375--
370 miles of pedestrian fencing in the 2007 to 2009 fiscal year 
period and 300 additional miles of vehicular fencing. That is 
in place today.
    And I remember Coast Guard briefings from the period when 
that fencing was going online about the impact of migrants and 
smugglers who were increasingly prone to come to the U.S. by 
sea when their land routes were cut off or were impeded.
    So I wonder what kind of data you actually have from those 
earlier years on the correlation between enhanced physical 
obstruction on the land border and waterborne migrant traffic 
numbers. Have you made any projections about what the 
operational impact on the Coast Guard would be of this proposed 
border wall?
    Admiral Zukunft. Thank you, Congressman. If we are looking 
at a defense and offense, a wall is certainly a defensive 
approach. It is a goal-line defense.
    I am the offensive coach, so what does the offensive coach 
do is when it comes to illicit goods, human trafficking, in 
most--this is moving almost predominantly by sea, eventually 
working its way up to the southwest border. I met with 
President Santos in Bogota 2 months ago to address the 
significant increase in coca cultivation, cocaine production, 
all destined for the United States. It takes to the sea.
    We have these authorities, and that is the one place where 
this commodity is vulnerable is on the water. When it lands in 
Central America the corruption, rule of law has really taken 
over. And in fact, it facilitates the movement of this 
commodity rather than in bulk--you know, 80, 90-pound bales of 
cocaine, now you are talking grams--that try to ride along the 
legitimate trade between the United States and Mexico, and that 
is secreted into the United States.
    So once it touches land I almost view that as a, you know, 
as a disease--what it does to law enforcement, what it does to 
elected officials. If we can stop it at sea we give those 
communities, that security environment, a better opportunity to 
get a grip on some of this violent crime that is taking place.
    So the offensive coach says you need more offensive play 
downrange. You have got all the authorities to go right into 
their waters and apprehend them, you know, regardless of where 
they are at.
    All these countries want to see them extradited almost 
without exception here to the United States to prosecute. And 
before they are prosecuted they will turn evidence and provide 
us valuable information on where the next load is coming. So it 
feeds that whole intelligence cycle.
    So the offensive game is a pretty sound investment. I am 
not the defensive coach so I can't really speculate on, you 
know, what it takes to stand up that goal-line defense in the 
form of a wall.
    Mr. Price. But it will be--your defensive capacity, in 
terms of the small craft coming into this country, which, of 
course, could conceivably increase if the land routes are 
further restricted, that defensive capacity will be required. 
You are exercising it right now.
    Is there any projections about that or any comments about 
how it worked last time?
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes. So thank you, Congressman. So, yes, 
we looked at, you know, that defensive approach, if you will, 
we saw with Cuba. This time last year I had between eight and 
10 ships, you know, in the Florida Straits because we saw last 
year a record movement of Cuban migrants. We have now gone 7 
weeks without one Cuban migrant apprehended at sea or even 
attempting to flee.
    But we realize, you know, as you allude to, it is the 
squeeze-the-balloon effect. If you apply pressure, as in a 
wall, then, you know, illicit activity will find the path of 
least resistance, and that path is the water, which means we 
would have to draw down assets to apply that defensive measure 
if we saw a change from land to maritime access to our 
homeland.
                            CUBAN MIGRATION
    Mr. Price. Do I have any time remaining?
    All right. All right. I will move just quickly to this 
Cuban matter because that was going to be my next question if 
time permitted.
    You have cited the statistics already. The interdiction 
numbers are down and actually at zero. Is that what you said? 
That is what I understand, as well.
    Admiral Zukunft. At sea, Congressman, zero.
    Mr. Price. Yes, at sea. That is what I mean.
    So what does that mean in terms of the deployment of Coast 
Guard resources? That offers, of course, a possibility to focus 
on other areas, other problems. What are your projections 
there?
    Admiral Zukunft. What changed in the Florida Straits was 
the repeal of the wet foot, dry foot policy.
    Mr. Price. That is right.
    Admiral Zukunft. And so we have been able to move some of 
those ships deeper into the Caribbean, and so now we are seeing 
shipments of cocaine that have been leaving Venezuela, the 
Guajira Peninsula in Colombia, destined for either Puerto Rico, 
the Dominican Republic--from there they go to Puerto Rico, as 
well. And so we have seen an uptick in our at-sea interdictions 
because we have been able to push those ships, those 
resources--fewer of them in the Florida Straits to now look at 
some of these other threats.
    So I would call it a target-rich environment. So if it is 
not migrants, you know, there is plenty to do with all the 
other illicit activity in the Caribbean, also in the Eastern 
Pacific.
    Mr. Price. Thank you.
                      PROCUREMENT FUNDING STRATEGY
    Mr. Carter. Admiral, I want to go back to the icebreaker 
for a minute. As we have talked about, the U.S. Navy and the 
Coast Guard established this joint program office to managing 
the acquisition of this asset, and the bulk of the funding so 
far has been with defense appropriations.
    However, Defense Committee, in their report accompanying 
language in the fiscal year 2017 omnibus, encouraged the Coast 
Guard to budget for the--all follow-up requirements. The money 
that we got from the defense was the planning money.
    Can you tell this committee about the procurement funding 
strategy for this program in 2018 and beyond? Do you envision 
that we have to chin these $1 billion ships ourselves or are we 
going to still be getting shared cost with the big budget of 
the defense?
    Admiral Zukunft. Chairman, that is a great question and I 
have spent a lot of time talking to Sean Stackley, and as we 
look at building this first heavy icebreaker he is all onboard, 
you know, in standing up this integrated program office for the 
first. And we have also been looking at driving the cost of 
this first one down to get that cost figure under $1 billion. 
We haven't built one of these ships in 40 years. There will be 
a front-end investment.
    But I cannot go at risk, and the Navy has gotta--if they 
are going to a 355-ship Navy they have gotta recapitalize the 
Ohio-class submarines, you know, where does the Coast Guard 
equities play into there? And so that is a risk I am not 
willing to take in the out years.
    And I will look to see. You know, we are going to have to 
look very hard to make sure that we don't lose this 
appropriation. We certainly have the capability, the capacity 
within our acquisition program to see this program through. And 
in fact, I could not be more proud of our acquisition staff, 
who have held requirements steady, growth steady, on-time 
deliveries with zero-discrepancy ships being delivered to our 
service.
    But the funding piece is a huge concern going forward. When 
I look at the pressure that is going to be placed on the Navy 
with their recapitalization aspirations, this is a program we 
would be in a much safer place if we had the appropriation in a 
Coast Guard budget versus DOD.
    Mr. Carter. But you understand we are talking about a 
roughly $40 billion budget here versus a $600 billion budget 
there, and $1 billion for us is--means a lot of things have to 
go wanting in other areas of homeland security. As you well 
know, I have talked to you publicly and privately--I am all in 
for the icebreaker program. I definitely want this first 
icebreaker to be an example and I don't dispute your three-and-
three idea.
    But as I look down the tunnel of time, these are big-ticket 
items--as big a ticket items as we would have in the homeland 
security budget. We don't know where we are going to be with 
this administration. We may get beefed up because we are 
obviously part of where this president has a vision.
    But let's be practical: This is a big-ticket item so I am 
hoping the Navy won't bail out on us. And I didn't like that 
language when I saw it. You probably didn't like it either.
    Admiral Zukunft. No, sir.
                           LEASE ALTERNATIVE
    Mr. Carter. And back to another subject we have talked 
about extensively, but I know it is back on the table: the 
medium icebreaker idea, that there is this commercial ship that 
has been offered as a possible lease alternative on medium 
icebreaker, yet we--I don't think we have been able to see what 
this ship can actually do. It was designed as a service vehicle 
for offshore platforms and besides to get there, I assume.
    The question we have got to ask ourselves is--there are 
multiple. I am going to throw a couple of them out at you and 
see what you think. A, can it break ice in the Arctic and the 
Antarctic? Do we know? Do we not know?
    Can it perform law enforcement missions, i.e., boarding 
operations being operated by commercial crew? Would it require 
major reconfigurations to make it an active part of our fleet? 
And could leasing the service help mitigate the risk of 
icebreaker acquisition in the Arctic strategy?
    These are things I would wonder, I am sure you have looked 
at. What do you think?
    Admiral Zukunft. Thank you, Chairman.
    So over a year ago I sent a team of engineers down to look 
at this particular vessel. They provided me a report and so 
then I went down, and actually I went out to Seattle to see 
this ship, as well.
    And among other things, first of all, it has never 
completed ice trials. I mean, on paper it is an icebreaker but 
it hasn't demonstrated ability to break ice of what we would 
require a medium icebreaker to do.
    It is not configured to launch and recover boats to do law 
enforcement missions. It is not configured to hangar a 
helicopter. It is not equipped to do what I would consider 
sensitive communications at a classified level to do maritime 
domain awareness. And to do that with a civilian crew--perhaps 
it can be done, but there are a number of conditions that would 
need to be satisfied before we can entertain this.
    So we are in a dialogue with this vendor of, ``Here is what 
it would take.'' No one has put a price tag on the table, and I 
don't know what that price tag is.
    And I would not absentmindedly, you know, make a promissory 
to engage in this lease option, if you will, and then 
pressurize this committee to not only raise money to 
recapitalize a fleet but now I have got perhaps an exorbitant 
lease rate on a platform that may at best marginally meet our 
requirements. An so I need to be a responsible steward in that 
regard.
    So we will continue to have a dialogue with this vendor and 
ideally get to a point where, you know, we need to talk price 
here, and not conceptually.
    Mr. Carter. I am sorry?
    Mr. Ruppersberger. Could you yield for just a second?
    Mr. Carter. Yes, I yield.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. I would think that if we are going to 
move forward and spend the money, all the issues you said this 
ship does not have now, we need to move forward with an 
intelligence component. We need to look forward with all of the 
other issues you are talking about because that could be a--
when you are talking about oil reserves and gas reserves 
between Russia and China, that could be a really dangerous 
spot, and I think we need to be prepared and not just put money 
in--we have gotta be--we have gotta have something like the 
Zumwalt. You know what I am talking about? That new ship that 
we just----
    Admiral Zukunft. I have been on that one, too. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you for yielding. Yield back.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ruppersberger.
    And, you know, so basically we are still where we were when 
we had this conversation last time. We are still looking at it; 
there is an avenue of conversation going on, but the positions 
are still the same as per that report which I read the previous 
time you looked at it. We are pretty well in the same place.
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes, Chairman. We have been in the 
business for over 70 years. We know what it takes to operate in 
this very remote, harsh environment, and this is a unique 
design for a single purpose, and so we are more than willing to 
sit down with this vendor and have a back-and-forth.
    But until we actually start getting into the specifics and 
what are some of the costing algorithms involved, I am not 
ready to move forward until I have all that information in 
front of me. And it would be a breach of trust on my part for 
me to then turn to you, sir, and say, ``I am going to need this 
lift to lease something. I am not even sure if it is going to 
meet our requirements.''
    Mr. Carter. I assumed we were still in the same place but I 
had to ask because I knew that there still was a conversation 
going on.
    Admiral Zukunft. We are, sir.
    Mr. Carter. Does everybody want to do a second round or--
Okay----
                            BORDER SECURITY
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Well, first of all, I just want a little 
bit of clarification in your response to Mr. Price's question 
with regards to the impact of building a wall.
    It is my understanding then there is the unintended 
consequences, actually, that there will be increased migration 
and drug trafficking on the seas. And is the Coast Guard doing 
anything in anticipation that that might happen, especially 
with the limited funding that you have?
    Admiral Zukunft. Ranking Member, we haven't seen that 
happen yet, but probably no better insight than when I met with 
each of the presidents of the tri-border region of Honduras, 
Guatemala, and El Salvador. When you look at the economies, 
they are not doing well. When you look at the violent crime, 
not doing well. Lot of parents are actually pulling their 
children out of school because they are afraid they will be 
coopted by a gang, and so what is going to happen this next 
generation?
    And so what they are telling me is that their only hope is 
to get out of their country and they will do whatever means 
that it takes. And if a wall stands in their way at some point 
in time they will find a way to go around the wall. And so we 
have not seen that yet, but that would be a foreseeable 
consequence. If you have an impenetrable barrier on the land 
border then you go where there isn't a wall, and in all 
likelihood that would mean take to the sea.
                         UNFUNDED PRIORITY LIST
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Okay. In the fiscal year 2017 bill we 
were able to provide a small amount of funding, $10 million, 
for projects on the Coast Guard's unfunded priority list. And I 
imagine this list will likely grow to increase competition for 
funding created by the push for increased border security.
    Do you expect the unfunded priority list to grow in fiscal 
year 2018 and in future years?
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes. Thank you, Ranking Member.
    So we are doing triage on what I would call our shore 
infrastructure. And so when I laid out a way ahead and we talk 
about a $2 billion floor, if you will, for major acquisitions, 
$300 million of that would be allocated to our short 
infrastructure.
    What it does, it provides us a more deliberative approach 
on our major acquisitions to eat at the $1.5 billion shore 
infrastructure backlog that we have right now and do it in a 
deliberative way to a point in time where we don't have to look 
at an unfunded priority list and triage what our needs are one 
year to the next.
    But in the meantime, we do owe this committee our unfunded 
priority list for 2018. Our folks are hard at it. We have got 
our 2017 appropriation, and working that through our 
department, through OMB, I put the pressure on our folks 
because we need to get that to you on time because you have 
done tremendous lifting to work at those unfunded priorities. 
And again, I thank you for doing that.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Okay. So the list will be provided to 
us?
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Okay, because it is important. Obviously 
we are not going to have all the money to be able to address 
all of your needs, but I think it is important for us to know 
what those needs are and how you are prioritizing.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Ms. Roybal-Allard.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Just one more question, okay?
    Mr. Carter. Oh, I am sorry.
                           SOCIAL MEDIA ABUSE
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Because I was greatly disturbed to hear 
about the recent Marine Corps photo-sharing scandal in which 
the members of the Marines United Group posted explicit 
pictures of female Marines without their consent. What is even 
more egregious is that according to news reports, this group 
was discovered by regular rank and file Marines, not 
specialized investigators.
    What does the Coast Guard do to monitor social media for 
abusive behavior like this?
    Admiral Zukunft. So we sent a team of investigators so we, 
you know, worked with all the other armed services when this 
scandal came out. Relieved to see that we don't have a Coast 
Guard Web site of Coast Guard United. And in fact, there were 
very minimal involvement of victims, if you will, in this 
Marines United Web site.
    It is a challenge, just because of the proliferation of the 
websites that are out there, but we do have policies in place. 
This is harassment in the workplace. This is bullying. And so 
there are measures in place to hold people accountable.
    I know the commandant of the Marine Corps is looking at 
standards of accountability and, you know, this is a 
subculture. It is inconsistent with everything that all the 
armed services stand for, but there is this subculture.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Do you have investigators that actively 
look for this type of behavior?
    Admiral Zukunft. We are right now. So as part of this task 
force that was stood up we went out and we scanned the Web 
sites. And you have to get creative, you know, in looking, you 
know, for search engines and trying to find this. And some of 
the--are they on the dark Internet? But we have not seen any 
surface.
    You know, the other aspect of this subculture, you know, I 
put a communique out to the entire workforce that we are a 
service of bydoers. You know, we always talk about bystander, 
but you do something when you see something wrong.
    We have seen tremendous progress in the reduction of sexual 
assault in the United States Coast Guard. It was my imperative 
to try to drive this out of our service altogether, but our 
numbers are down 40 percent over the last year. Not only that, 
but more and more members are coming forward with unrestricted 
reports, which tells me they know that leadership takes this 
serious, we are going to hold those accountable that think that 
they can live a double standard, but not in my Coast Guard.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Thank you.
                          SMUGGLER PROSECUTION
    Mr. Carter. Dr. Harris.
    Dr. Harris. Thank you very much, and I am sorry I wasn't--
--
    Mr. Carter. Turn your mike on.
    Dr. Harris. I think it might be on. Just not close.
    Mr. Carter. If it is red it is on.
    Dr. Harris. Thank you very much.
    Thank you, Admiral, for being here today. A couple of 
questions.
    First of all, just one observation. I hope that we pay 
particular attention to the Bahamas and, you know, that 
international trafficking that might occur from the Bahamas 
because of their policies, you know, on visas. It seems like it 
would be a pretty easy entry route for some people to enter the 
United States who aren't here for good means.
    Anyway, let me ask about compliance with one of the--some 
of the executive orders the President has issued. Executive 
order 13773, Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to 
Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing 
International Trafficking--in your testimony you talk about the 
interception of--and again, it is the President's 
prioritization of saying, ``Look, we are actually going to get 
tough with people who attempt to do this.''
    But you say that, you know, 588 smugglers were detained but 
only 156 were referred for prosecution. You know, we heard--I 
believe it was in this subcommittee--from the Border Patrol 
under the last administration. You know, you have to carry a 
significant amount of drugs with you before you were 
prosecuted, which is just striking to me. I mean, we should 
have zero tolerance. These are drugs. These are harmful. These 
kill Americans.
    And so I am curious, if you detained 588 smugglers why are 
only 156 referred for prosecution?
    Admiral Zukunft. Doctor, I will have to get back to you on 
that 156 number because we are looking at nearly 100 percent 
prosecution rates.
    Dr. Harris. Well, but this is in your written testimony. I 
don't understand. This is not, you know, 588 smugglers; 580 
detained--this--I--and maybe you--maybe some of your staff can 
assist you with this who wrote this for you. Didn't that strike 
them as pretty unusual?
    You detained 588 people with drugs, I assume, or some 
illegal contraband, and you only prosecute 150. I mean, that 
bothers me tremendously.
    As someone who wants to protect the youth in my district 
from illegal substances that the last administration turned 
their back on, creating a horrendous, horrific epidemic in this 
country, I appreciate you getting back to me on it.
    Admiral Zukunft. Okay. As I said earlier, I was in Tampa, 
Florida on Monday. We take these detainees there, referred to 
the U.S. attorney, 100 percent prosecution. Many of them are 
providing information. So there are a lot of folks in the 
pipeline.
    Dr. Harris. Well, this says ``referred for prosecution.'' 
Doesn't say ``prosecuted.''
    Now, look, I don't understand whether you are being honest 
with me or not. You have plain English in your testimony. It 
says ``referred for prosecution.'' Doesn't say ``in a 
pipeline.''
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes, we will get back to you on that, sir, 
because I--
    [The information follows:]
    In 2016 a service-record 201.3 metric tons of cocaine (7.1 percent 
of estimated flow) were removed from the western transit zone, 585 
smugglers were detained and 156 cases were referred for prosecution.
    Of the 585 smugglers detained, 544 were referred for prosecution 
(468 referred for US prosecution; 76 referred for partner nation 
prosecution). The Department of Justice determined that there was not 
enough evidence to prosecute 41 of the 585 smugglers, and there were 
released.
    Dr. Harris. I hope that under this administration our 
border security has zero tolerance. And, Admiral, you are a 
part of our border security.
    Admiral Zukunft. Well, I am a zero-tolerance kind of guy, 
Doctor.
                      BORDER SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS
    Dr. Harris. I hope so. I hope so.
    All right. With regard to the immigration enforcement, we 
have obviously another executive order, 13767, Border Security 
and Immigration Enforcement Improvements, appear to be kind of 
directed toward the southern border but I assume that the Coast 
Guard looked at the executive order and said, ``Yes, there are 
actually things that we can improve in--under this order.''
    And again, to reverse the striking--the strikingly--I don't 
even know how you would phrase it--the catch-and-release 
policies of the last administration, the willingness to turn 
their back on defending our border. So I would like to know 
what the Coast Guard is doing with regards to that particular 
executive order, the enforcement improvements for our border 
security.
    Admiral Zukunft. Well, Doctor, before this executive order 
we had more than doubled our Coast Guard presence in the 
transit zone--illicit drugs. We removed a record amount of 
cocaine last year and we will probably beat that record again 
this year.
    So we have repositioned where we have forces.
    Now we do that--I don't have more ships than I had the year 
before. I have taken them out of other areas to double down 
here. In fact, we are the only--you know, we don't see other 
aspects of our military operating this domain, so I have taken 
that upon myself.
    We have not seen any Cuban migrants since a wet foot, dry 
foot policy went into effect in January. We have in the last 7 
weeks not one Cuban migrant.
    The threat vector you alluded to, the Bahamas--so some of 
those ships that were between Florida and Cuba, we are now 
looking at the threat coming from the Bahamas. Most of what we 
are seeing is what I would call human smuggling: Brazilians, 
Venezuelans. We are not seeing those special interest aliens 
that may be coming to the United States to cause us harm, but 
we are looking at that threat, as well.
    We have joint task forces created on the Department of 
Homeland Security. We have Coast Guard, CBP, Homeland Security 
Investigations working hand in glove to look at--most of this 
is focused almost exclusively on illegal migration, but to work 
not just on the members but what is the network that are moving 
these people, as well.
    Dr. Harris. Well, thank you. And I appreciate that because, 
you know, there are only two ways to get into this country 
illegally. They gotta come by land or by sea. And, you know, 
you have a huge role in the by sea.
    And with regards to getting back to me on the first 
question, I understand that you can only catch. Obviously a 
prosecutor has to agree to prosecute. And that is what I want 
to know.
    I want to know if what is--what we heard at our southern 
border was that the prosecutors were unwilling to prosecute 
low-level drug crimes when they involved violating our borders 
to deliver drugs here to kill our people. That is what they do. 
Drugs kill our people.
    So I understand, but you are the one who is best able to 
say, ``Look, we find these people. Somebody downstream isn't 
doing what they need to do.'' So I am depending on you to let 
me know what is going on there.
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes.
    Dr. Harris. Thank you.
    Admiral Zukunft. So again, there may be a technicality. So 
these were cases, versus individuals. So typical smuggling 
package is four to five people, and that goes into a case 
package.
    Dr. Harris. Okay.
    Admiral Zukunft. And so we may be, you know, I think in 
violent agreement, perhaps, but I need to validate, okay, who 
are in these cases, what are the numbers of people. But 
typically it is four to five in a go-fast and they typically 
plead out. And again, prosecution rate pretty darn high.
    Dr. Harris. Good. And that is what I need to go after. 
Because again, what we heard from the southern border is that 
the prosecution rate wasn't high. Because I think the--when you 
seize contraband I think it is probably higher quantities. I 
mean, people don't put one little cube of marijuana on a boat.
    But if you can get back to me, I would appreciate that.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Carter. Mr. Cuellar.
                              LEGAL SYSTEM
    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Let me just follow up on my colleague.
    This is an issue I have been looking at because I do live 
on the border, and I assume this applies to any of the U.S. 
attorneys. Brought this to the attention of Chairman Wolf some 
time ago because what you have is every U.S. attorney district 
will have a different policy.
    You, just like Border Patrol, you do your job. You get 
them; you present them over to the U.S. attorney's office.
    The U.S. attorneys--because Congress, and that means, if I 
can just correct my colleague, it is not the past 
administration; it is the past administrations, with an S, and 
this could continue if we don't add money into the legal 
system.
    The problem is Congress always puts money into Border 
Patrol, the law enforcement, and you create activity because 
you arrest people, you put them down the legal system. But if 
we don't have the U.S. attorneys, judges, and if you look at 
the caseload for the judges on the border, they are about this 
high compared to other judges who have a level caseload this 
high.
    So if we don't add judges, U.S. attorneys, U.S. marshals, 
and everybody down the stream, then what they are going to 
continue doing is they are going to continue prioritizing the 
cases. And I know that because I get frustrated in my area 
because, without revealing the amount of drugs where they 
either say, ``We are not going to prosecute,'' or, ``We are 
going to give it to the local district attorney,'' and the 
local district attorney say, ``Hey, we are already loaded up 
here,'' then what happens is I joke around that if you are a 
bad guy all you have to do is X amount, just be a pound under 
and you might be let go because--or sent to the State level 
because of the priorities.
    So it is all a matter of funding, and if we just keep 
putting money on the goal line then all we are going to have is 
we are going to have the same problem past administrations--
with an S--and current administration. Unless we seriously put 
money on judges--I am talking about the border, the judges, the 
U.S. attorneys, the U.S. marshals, and everybody down the 
system, we are going to be in the same thing and still be 
talking about this for a while.
    In my opinion, it is not your fault. It is a matter of 
putting money into the legal system, number one.
    You also mentioned that the wall is a defense and you do an 
offense on the water. I respectfully disagree.
    I think if you look at the $18 billion that we spend on 
land and ocean, that is a one-yard line, the goal line. And if 
you want to play football I would rather play defense not on 
the one-yard line, but I would rather play defense on the--
their 20-yard line, which means that, like you mentioned, work 
with Central America, work with the Colombians. You know, the 
president is here this week, as you know--Colombian president.
    And that is what we need to do--extend our perimeter 
instead of playing on defense. So we appreciate your efforts on 
that last point.
    The last thing I want you to consider--and I got some 
language into the law some years ago and the Coast Guard did a 
report--is the only international waterway that you all don't 
really spend time on is the Rio Grande. And I understand it is 
not--it is what they call--a member of the last Coast Guard, it 
is brown waters compared to blue waters, and you prefer blue 
waters. I understand that.
    And I understand that it is not deep, but you have got 
those airboats that are available there. I know the air marine 
is doing some work there, but just want to just mention for the 
record the only international river that you all don't do any 
work on, really spend, is the Rio Grande, just--and it is 
international waters, as you know, because it is an 
international river.
                            Closing Remarks
    So I do want to say I appreciate your work. I look forward 
to working with you on the icebreakers.
    When I mentioned to Secretary Tillis he said he was going 
to talk to--Tillerson--he was going to talk to the President. 
So if he mentioned it at the speech I guess he did do that, or 
maybe he listened to somebody's wife. I don't know what--but 
either way, I want to be supportive of the committee on the 
icebreakers because we just can't forget about the Arctic.
    I do appreciate the work that you do, and sometimes your 
hands are tied.
    And, Mr. Harris, I would be happy to work with you because 
I have been looking at this for a long time. And it is 
frustrating. It really is frustrating that law enforcement--
that includes you also in the work--you present it over at the 
U.S. attorneys, they don't have the resources, and therefore 
they make priorities, and I don't like those priorities on 
that. But unfortunately, if we don't put the money we are going 
to be talking about this for this administration, other 
administrations.
    But I appreciate the work that you all do.
    Admiral Zukunft. Congressman, just on that note, where we 
prosecute these drug cases I have taken out of hide a number of 
our JAG officers as special assistants to the U.S. attorney so 
we can move these cases forward. And I will continue to make 
that investment to take some of that burden so these do not 
become low-priority cases, and so we do get the prosecution, as 
well.
    Mr. Cuellar. Yes.
    And finally, Mr. Chairman, keep in mind Miami Vice, and, 
you know, in the 1980s if you remember the drugs were coming in 
through the southern--I mean, that area of the United States. 
Some of us in Texas were saying, ``You know, one of these days 
it is like a balloon. If you put the pressure here they are 
going to come another way.''
    Sure enough, years later here we are talking about the 
border. And as you know, when you talk about billions of 
dollars of drugs coming in, there--we have consumption in the 
U.S. and the bad guys are going to--transnational groups are 
going to be making money, they are going to find a way. If you 
block over here they are going to come another way and it is a 
constant, ever-going, you know, strategy that we gotta have. It 
is not static. It is ongoing and, again, you all play a very 
important role.
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes. And just adjacent to your district, 
you know, down in South Padre Island huge influx of illegal 
poaching by Mexican fishing vessels fishing in U.S. waters. And 
a lot of these fish are protected--red snapper, for example.
    So a lot of effort being expended by the Coast Guard to 
stem this back. Weekly we are, you know, seizing these Pangas, 
but they just keep coming and coming.
    If you are down in Port Isabel you will see a yard filled 
with hundreds of these boats that we are seizing. So right now 
it has been a pressure point for us on our border as it 
approaches the Rio Grande.
    Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Carter. Mr. Cuellar has done a lot of very hard work, 
and I have also twisted Mr. Culberson's arm. We are getting 
more legal resources into this project.
    Mr. Taylor.
                             COUNTERRORISM
    Mr. Taylor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Admiral, real quick can we speak about the antiterrorism 
force, MSRT I think it is? Can you just talk to us about--you 
know, and let me preface this by saying I was very impressed by 
the coordination and collaboration down on the border, 
specifically in the San Diego area, of course, with the Coast 
Guard and CPV and how that--just using each other's strengths 
and weaknesses and leveraging those. I thought it was awesome.
    On the antiterrorism force, MSRT, is that something that 
you see that is essential for the Coast Guard mission? Is it 
absolutely needed?
    If so, is it--what are the capabilities currently? Do you 
need more funding for it? Can you just talk a little bit about 
that, please?
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes. Thank you, Congressman.
    And as you would well appreciate, you know, these are 
actually counterterrorism, not antiterrorism.
    Mr. Taylor. Counterterrorism----
    Admiral Zukunft. Two teams, one in San Diego, one in 
Chesapeake, each team about 200 people strong.
    I was just at SOCOM. I met with General Thomas on Monday, 
as well, and as you know, SOCOM is lead for, you know weapons 
of mass destruction proliferation. You know, they are the go-to 
team.
    The Coast Guard has over nearly a dozen bilateral 
agreements. It covers every flag state of convenience.
    We have a national targeting center in Reston, Virginia. We 
work with CBP, Coast Guard. So we screen every ship over 300 
gross tons on an international voyage--the cargo, the cargo 
manifest, where was it packed, who are the people?
    And so if there is an anomaly and say, ``Well, wait a 
minute. You know, there could be a weapon of mass destruction. 
We don't know 100 percent, but there might be one in this 
container.''
    We have the authority to board that ship anywhere on the 
high seas, and if they are not compliant then we have 
agreements with Third Fleet to provide vertical lift, so we 
come in with a team, we fast-rope in. We take positive control 
of that ship. We stop it, and then we go ahead and we do the 
search.
    We can do everything but what Special Forces can't do. I 
can't say that in an unclassified environment.
    But it gives us that authority in an ambiguous threat to 
stop it before a ship, say, enters the Port of San Diego, a 
military port, and now we have got a commercial ship with a 
weapon of mass destruction on it.
    So we still see a requirement for us to have it. Either 
that or we assume away there will be no proliferation of 
nuclear material, you know, forever to come. And when I look at 
Pakistan, I look at North Korea, I am not ready to make that 
assumption, so we need to sustain this capability.
    This is not your everyday Coasties. We are open to both 
genders, but as you can appreciate, what it takes to get folks 
through that level of competency from weapons to agility, the 
muscle memory that is required to do these jobs, these are a 
one-of-a-kind--we have two of them in the United States Coast 
Guard--in the Department of Homeland Security, for that matter, 
as well.
    Mr. Taylor. Just a quick question, a quick follow up on 
that, and certainly not diminishing any capabilities that are 
at the level of what they do, and I think it is awesome, you 
know, I know that in San Diego specifically, where the Navy 
will utilize the Coast Guard and they will work collaboratively 
to use some of the law enforcement powers to be able to board 
ships, as you very well know, again, is that something that 
SOCOM can be a part of, again, or--and also, what is the budget 
for the counterterrorism forces currently for----
    Admiral Zukunft. Yes. So we have both of those in budget. I 
will get back to you on what that exact number is.
    The total budget for counterterrorism forces is approximately $51 
million; this includes personnel, training, equipment, and operations 
costs. MSRT Chesapeake accounts for $24.7 million and MSST San Diego 
accounts for $26.3M of the total.
    But at the same time, you know, I have advanced 
interdiction teams from these elements that are currently 
filling a niche over in, you know, in CENTCOM's AOR. That takes 
a burden off our soft community, our Navy SEALS as they are 
looking at doing other things.
    So we do get those requests for forces for a capability, 
and these are teams, we call them advanced interdiction teams, 
that can provide these platforms serving off Navy ships.
    Then what it provides, you know, NAVCENT is the ability of 
saying, ``OK, these aren't just Title 10. We could also do 
Title 14 law enforcement because we have this unique team that 
can switch hit Title 10 and Title 14.''
    Mr. Taylor. Excellent.
                                 PORTS
    Switching gears really quickly--thank you. Thank you, 
Admiral. We have heard about modernizing the fleet of Coast 
Guard cutters and might acquire additional mile pier length 
beyond your current fleet needs and that you are potentially 
looking to cluster your assets and optimize more shore 
maintenance activities. Any chance of potentially home-porting 
those fleets in the Tidewater area?
    Admiral Zukunft. Tidewater has been a great home for us. It 
is a great home for our people, too. I mean, they always say it 
is a Navy port; well, it is a Coast Guard port, too, as well.
    So as we look at building out our fleet of offshore patrol 
cutters we will probably have to extend our pier lengths that 
we have at our base in Portsmouth. We will probably have to do 
some dredging.
    But when we look at just not the infrastructure but we also 
look at the communities--the health care, the schools, and the 
fact that you can do multiple assignments in the same 
geographic region and our people like being there--they stay in 
the Coast Guard. So Tidewater has always been friendly to the 
Coast Guard, and you can count on seeing white ships with red 
racing stripes in the Tidewater region for the indefinite 
future.
                            CLOSING REMARKS
    Mr. Taylor. Excellent. Well, thanks for your service. 
Thanks for your testimony today. Thanks for all of your service 
over there. We appreciate you and look forward to working with 
you. Thank you.
    Admiral Zukunft. Thank you, Congressman.
    Mr. Taylor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Carter. Admiral, we thank you for being here. We went a 
little long, but the reality is you guys are kind of the 
darling of our world that we live in in this subcommittee and 
we are glad to be able to have a conversation with you.
    Thank you for your patience. Thank you for the great work 
you do. Thank all of the Coasties for us. They are models for 
America. I appreciate you.
    Admiral Zukunft. Chairman, thank you.
    Ranking Member--all the members, and I especially want to 
thank those sitting on the back seats over there, just like the 
people sitting behind me. A lot of this work doesn't happen 
without the support of our staffs, so again, thank you very 
much.
    Mr. Carter. Yes, sir.

             UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
                                WITNESS
HON. JOHN F. KELLY, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY
    Mr. Carter. All right. Today's hearing is called to order.
    Welcome to the subcommittee's first hearing on the 
Department of Homeland Security's fiscal year 2018 presidential 
budget request.
    I would like to extend a special welcome to today's 
witness, Secretary John Kelly.
    Mr. Secretary, we are very pleased you answered the 
President's call to lead DHS. Having someone with your 
credentials at the Department will strengthen it and enrich it. 
It is good to begin the fiscal year 2018 appropriation cycle. 
Despite the late start, I am confident the subcommittee will 
produce a bill that supports the Department's mission, balances 
competing interests, and is affordable to the American 
taxpayers.
    Before I dive into the numbers, Mr. Secretary, I have a 
couple of pieces of advice. First never lose focus on the 
Department's highest priority of keeping the Nation safe and 
enforce the law of the United States. With your reputation, I 
know you will do that.
    Second, stay in touch with me, Ms. Roybal-Allard, and the 
subcommittee, and let us know when you need help. Everyone on 
this subcommittee wants DHS to be successful meeting its 
mission, besides, failure is absolutely unacceptable.
    Two, I know I speak for everyone when I promised we will 
always listen respectfully to your suggestions and advice, and 
we will be reasonable and evenhanded in our responses.
    I for one am grateful the President directed you and the 
men and women of DHS to focus on the Department's law 
enforcement missions.
    I am tremendously pleased catch and release is a relic of 
the past. And as a result, illegal crossings of the border are 
60 percent lower--64 percent lower than in April the same time 
last year.
    This is proof that the President enforcing the Nation's 
immigration laws is a forceful deterrent. I am also satisfied 
with the $1.5 billion border security package included in the 
fiscal year 2017 omnibus bill. Simply enacting legislation that 
supports enhanced border security and interior enforcement 
sends a powerful message to human traffickers and drug runners 
that business as usual on the border is over. If you break our 
Nation's laws and cross the border illegally, you will suffer 
the consequences, which is a guaranteed stay in detention.
    The fiscal year 2018 request continues the administration's 
emphasis on law enforcement, and that is important. The total 
discretionary funds requested is $44.06 billion, which is an 
increase of $1.66 billion over last year. Items I am pleased to 
see you included are the $2.6 billion for border security, 
which includes 74 miles of physical barrier along the southwest 
border and significant investments in surveillance, technology, 
and aviation systems; $4.9 billion for enforcement and removal 
operations, including $3.6 billion for 51,379 detention beds, 
an increase of 12,055 above the amount provided in fiscal year 
2017. Additional funding is proposed to actively enforce the 
Nation's immigration laws.
    Substantial increases are proposed for additional law 
enforcement agents at Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement. Though I support this initiative this subcommittee 
will take a hard look at whether it will succeed. As I am sure 
you know, attrition in both organizations has outpaced hiring 
in the last 2 years, despite congressional increases for 
incentive programs. I am not inclined to leave money on the 
table if DHS is unable to meet these hiring goals.
    For the first time in many years, the United States Secret 
Service request meets their requirements.
    I have concerns, too. The cyber threat to the Nation's 
network and critical infrastructure grows daily, yet, the 
budget for cybersecurity has not increased at all from your 
current level of funding.
    While there is funding for border security, there should 
also be corresponding increases for our ports of entry where 
the majority of all illicit drugs and currency enter our 
country. Physical barriers may stop human trafficking, but they 
are not the only means of decreasing illegal drugs and 
currency.
    Slashing funds for FEMA critical grants and training 
programs by $918 million is worrisome and shortsighted, 
especially for cities that are targets of terrorism.
    Likewise, I am surprised and disappointed that the 
administration chose to perpetuate the last administration's 
bad habit of proposing fees to increase TSA and using it as an 
offset despite knowing it is unlikely to become law.
    While balancing all the continuing priorities of DHS is an 
understandable challenge, I remain concerned about reliance on 
budget gimmicks and cuts to important national security 
programs. I hope the fiscal year 2019 request will focus on the 
Nation's homeland security priorities and not allow offsets 
that this subcommittee doesn't control.
    In conclusion, I want to restate my commitment to work with 
you, and I also want to take a moment to commend the budget 
offices of every DHS component and at DHS headquarters. 
Executing under a CR, proposing and advocating for a budget 
amendment, and developing a new budget request over a 2-month 
period is a monumental undertaking. They deserve our thanks.
    I want you to know that I am blessed to have Lucille 
Roybal-Allard as my ranking member. She and I don't always 
agree 100 percent on the policy, but her balance and helpful 
approach engenders collaboration, which means a better bill for 
the men and women of DHS. For that, I want to thank her and 
recognize her for any remark she wishes to make.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary, and welcome to your first 
appearance before this subcommittee.
    There is no doubt that you have a really hard job, and in 
my opinion, among the hardest in government.
    The Department is still quite young and still maturing in 
institutional terms, and it has a large and diverse set of 
components and missions.
    Some of those missions, as you well know, are extremely 
controversial. We will disagree about some policies and 
priorities as we did with your predecessor. In some cases, we 
will strongly disagree. We do, however, share the common goal 
of protecting our country and its values.
    My hope is that we will have the same constructive working 
relationship with you that we had with Secretary Johnson.
    The members of the subcommittee have the common goal of 
appropriately resourcing the Department to protect and to serve 
our country. This includes supporting the men and women who 
make up your Department, the vast majority of whom are fully 
dedicated to their work and are performing admirably.
    Immigration enforcement will be the biggest challenge that 
we will face in working together. I hope you understand that in 
my view, the crux of this issue is not simply a matter of 
enforcing the law or not. It is the manner in which that 
enforcement is done.
    It is also a question of the incremental benefit to the 
Nation of significant new investments in border security and 
immigration enforcement actions and capabilities.
    Each additional segment of physical barrier at the border 
and each initiative to hire more immigration enforcement 
officers comes potentially at the expense of things like State 
and local preparedness, cybersecurity, investments in the Coast 
Guard fleet, and a multitude of other priorities outside of our 
bill.
    So it isn't enough to simply ask whether an investment 
would improve homeland security. We must also ask what the 
incremental benefit is, what the downsides are, and what the 
tradeoffs are.
    Mr. Secretary, our immigration laws are entirely out of 
step with the situation on the ground in this country. On your 
watch, I know you see an aggressive enforcement posture as 
faithfully carrying out the laws currently on the books, but 
you do have discretion.
    And right now, that aggressive enforcement is upending the 
lives of millions of people, the vast majority of whom are 
valuable, contributing members of their communities. The vast 
majority of whom are guilty of no criminal acts. The vast 
majority of whom have been in this country for many years 
working jobs that others are unwilling to do.
    For example, I have had growers from California and 
representatives from the hotel and restaurant industry tell me 
and other Members of Congress about the devastating economic 
impact current enforcement policies will have and in some cases 
are already having on our State and national economy. These 
consequences are also a threat to national security.
    The ultimate answer is for Congress to enact comprehensive 
immigration reform that lays out a path to legal status and 
eventually, if one meets all the criteria for eligibility, 
citizenship. Many of us desperately want that to happen.
    While it is up to Congress to pass reform legislation, you, 
as Secretary of Homeland Security, could play an important role 
in helping that to come about.
    I also want to encourage you to continue an effort that was 
begun by your predecessor that is very important to this 
subcommittee. Secretary Johnson made a high priority of 
maturing the Department's planning, budgeting, and acquisition 
processes, including working with us to establish a common 
appropriation structure.
    I hope that you will capitalize on his accomplishments by 
also making it your priority to further improve and 
institutionalize those processes.
    We have a lot to discuss this afternoon, and I look forward 
to your testimony and your responses to our questions.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Carter. I thank you, Ms. Roybal-Allard.
    I now recognize Rodney Frelinghuysen, the chairman of the 
full committee.
    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Chairman Carter, for the 
time.
    I also want to welcome the Secretary here to the 
Appropriations Committee. We look forward to your testimony, 
and hearing your frank and candid views on many issues.
    All of us up here thank you for your remarkable service, as 
a Marine of over 45 years and now as Secretary of Department of 
Homeland Security. We appreciate all of that you have done for 
our Nation.
    Today's hearing is an important part of the oversight 
duties of this committee, now that we have formally received 
the administration's budget request. The committee will 
undertake a thorough analysis of it. We will go through each 
and every budget line, question every witness, and demand 
credible spending justifications and only then will we make our 
own determinations on the best use of tax dollars.
    We intend to put forward a complete set of appropriations 
bills that adequately fund important programs while working to 
reduce and eliminate waste and duplication.
    I will work with the ranking member, Mrs. Lowey and 
Chairman Carter, and Ms. Roybal-Allard to move rapidly in the 
coming weeks and months to complete the fiscal year 2018 
appropriations bills.
    Again, today's hearing is part of a process we followed to 
determine the best use of taxpayers' dollars. After all, the 
power of the purse lies in this building. It is the 
constitutional duty of Congress to make spending decisions on 
behalf of the people we represent at home.
    Some here on the committee may know that hundreds of 
families, almost 700 in New Jersey, and in my congressional 
district, lost loved ones on September 11 in those terrorist 
attacks.
    Although it took years for the Nation to recover from that 
attack, the events of that day made us rethink how we protect 
the Nation and allowed us to learn from prior mistakes in order 
to prepare for and stop the next attack.
    Mr. Secretary, I wholeheartedly agree with your recent 
assessment that the risk of a terror attack on these United 
States in your own words is as threatening today as it was on 
that faithful day in September in 2001.
    And, unfortunately, this week, we witnessed another 
horrific attack on our British allies, and we extend our 
greatest sympathy to these young victims and their families.
    That is why we must be certain to continue to invest in 
critical programs like the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency's urban area security initiatives that ensure our 
communities, which face the greatest risk, are able to respond 
to ever-growing and more complex threats.
    The fiscal year 2018 budget request proposes a 25 percent 
cut to the Urban Area Security Initiative the (UASI) program. 
And I am eager to hear how your Department will continue to 
ensure the necessary resilience while absorbing such a large 
deduction.
    In light of the recent spike of anti-Semitic crimes, which 
were directed at hundreds of Jewish schools, and synagogues, 
and temples, and community centers in the United States, 
including those in my district, we must continue to direct 
funding to the UASI nonprofit security grant program, which 
provides at risk nonprofit institutions of all faiths, critical 
assistance to bolster their physical security.
    And lastly, I would like to give a shout out to one of your 
most important urban search and rescue teams, including New 
Jersey's task force one, which became a federally designated 
team this time last year. New Jersey task force one, which was 
the first team to respond to the tragedy at the World Trade 
Center on 9/11 was activated and responded to also to Hurricane 
Matthew in October. These teams are essential to the entire 
Nation.
    In conclusion, I welcome you.
    And I thank the chairman for the time, and I yield back.
    Mr. Carter. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I now recognize Mrs. Lowey, the ranking member of the full 
committee.
    Mrs. Lowey. Thank you. And I would like to thank Chairman 
Carter and Ranking Member Roybal-Allard for holding this 
hearing. And, of course, it is always a pleasure for me to 
appear with Chairman Frelinghuysen, who is a distinguished 
chair of the full committee.
    Secretary Kelly, welcome and thank you for joining us.
    The Department of Homeland Security's mission is to secure 
our Nation from consistent threat. It is not an easy one. It is 
underscored by the tragic attack in Manchester earlier this 
week. To keep us safe, different agencies within the Department 
of Homeland Security must effectively coordinate and cooperate 
while also working closely with other Federal, State, and local 
agencies.
    The budget request, unfortunately, does not fully reflect 
the grave character of the threats we face. In New York and 
many other States, preparedness grants are the difference 
between being able to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and 
recover from acts of terrorism or not.
    Secretary Kelly, put simply, your budget proposal would 
make communities like those in my district and regions less 
safe. The State Homeland Security grant program, which enhances 
local law enforcement's ability to prevent and respond to acts 
of terrorism, would be reduced by $118 million or over 25 
percent, reduced at this time of the absolute need for response 
as quickly as possible. That results in a nearly 20 million 
reduction for my home State of New York alone.
    The Urban Area Security Initiative, which as you know 
assists high threat, high density urban areas, arguably the 
most vulnerable, would be cut by 26 percent or $156 million. 
That is a nearly $45 million cut for New York. Maybe the people 
who put this budget together are not really watching the news 
that we all were watching just this week.
    The emergency food and shelter program is eliminated, as is 
the flood hazard mapping and risk analysis program.
    State and local jurisdictions cannot effectively plan for 
the worst when support from their Federal partner is 
inconsistent or insufficient.
    In addition to terror threats, we know that the severity 
and cost of natural disasters are increasing, and mitigation 
efforts can reduce taxpayer support in response to a disaster.
    We cannot expect communities to realistically prepare for 
natural disasters with proposed cuts of 55 million to the 
predisaster mitigation program.
    As I said, while negotiating the fiscal year 2017 omnibus, 
I cannot support a single cent, let alone 1.6 billion for a 
boondoggle of a wall. It is an unjustified request based on a 
campaign promise and simply cannot be taken seriously by this 
committee.
    President Trump's budget request slashing $54 billion from 
nondefense investment would decimate the Department of Homeland 
Security.
    In fact, even existing sequestration level caps are 
insufficient and would lead to reduce services that American 
families and communities need, including law enforcement and 
first responders.
    It is time, Mr. Secretary, for a new budget deal to end 
sequestration once and for all, in part to prevent disastrous 
cuts to critical Homeland Security grant programs.
    Now more than ever, this committee must support the 
Department's essential and complex mission, but we cannot do 
that at the expense of State and local preparedness.
    So I look forward to a productive discussion today, and I 
thank you for your service to our country.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey.
    We are going to stick to a 5-minute rule, probably try to 
warn you when you have got 1 minute left, but keep an eye on 
the clock.
    Mr. Secretary, we are going to allow you to make your 
opening statement now. Your statement will be entered into the 
record, so you can make it shorter and easier on us.
                   Opening Statement--Secretary Kelly
    Secretary Kelly. Well, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Roybal-
Allard, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, it 
really is a privilege to be here.
    I know you feel the same way I do that a government has no 
greater responsibility than the safety and security of its 
citizens. A secure homeland is one of prosperity where legal 
trade and travel add to the National economy. A secure homeland 
is one of freedom where American citizens can go about their 
lives without fear. And a secure homeland is one of laws which 
we enforce to keep our communities safe.
    So it is with great honor and privilege to appear before 
you today to discuss the men and women of the Department of 
Homeland Security and the critical missions they carry on every 
day in service to this Nation.
    I believe the President's fiscal year 2018 budget request 
for the Department of Homeland Security will make it possible 
for us to continue and expand on our ability to protect the 
Nation and its people.
    We know that threats are out there. We know that our 
passenger aviation is an example, our top prize in the eyes of 
terrorist organizations around the globe. We know that 
transnational criminal organizations are bringing drugs across 
our borders both on land and sea in massive numbers at a 
devastating rate.
    We know that our Nation's cyber systems run a constant 
attack. We know that natural disasters devastate American 
hometowns. We also know that DHS is up to the job of protecting 
the United States against all of these threats and many, many 
more.
    Just last week, the Coast Guard offloaded more than 18 tons 
of cocaine they seized in international waters off the eastern 
Pacific ocean. That is roughly the weight of nine cars. And it 
is certainly at least as estimated $498 million worth of drugs, 
but more importantly, drugs that won't serve to poison our 
citizens.
    This week, on May 8, and 14, TSA Transportation Security 
Administration discovered--between May 8 and 14, discovered 76 
firearms in carry-on luggage. In 6 weeks, ICE arrested more 
than 1,000 gang members in a nationwide multi-law gang 
enforcement operation. The men and women at DHS are making a 
difference. They are making our Nation more secure, but we need 
a budget that matches our mission.
    No more continuing resolutions. We have to be able to plan, 
and I think this budget does that.
    The President's fiscal year 2018 budget requests 44.1 
billion in net discretionary funding for the Homeland Security 
Department. It also requests 7.4 billion to finance the cost of 
emergencies and major disasters in FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund.
    When you are talking about numbers like these, it is easy 
to lose sight of what is behind each dollar. When you get right 
down to it, behind each and every dollar are hardworking men 
and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting the 
American people by enforcing the laws that you have passed.
    They are taking dangerous criminals off our streets, 
keeping terrorists out of the country, and drugs off of our 
streets. They are investigating crimes with international 
implications. They are making sure passengers get to their 
destinations safely. They are responding to devastated 
communities in the wake of natural disasters. And they are 
patrolling and maintaining our Nation's waterways, waterways 
that support $4.5 trillion in economic activity every year.
    Every dollar invested in the men and women of DHS and every 
dollar invested in the tools, the infrastructure, equipment, 
and training they need to get the job done is an investment in 
prosperity, freedom, and the rule of law. It is an investment 
in the security of the American people.
    There is no greater responsibility in a time of no greater 
need than now.
    I would be remiss if I did not mention the terrorist attack 
in Manchester on Monday, as some of you have. Our friends in 
the U.K. suffered a terrible loss this week with 22 dead and 
dozens others wounded. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. 
The U.S. Government is actively working, as you can imagine, 
with the British, the FBI, the intelligence community, DHS, and 
others to assist their investigation in any way that we can.
    Their enemy is our enemy. He is evolving, becoming more 
reprehensible, even targeting children. He is much more 
sophisticated, adaptive. He is global. And you can bet that 
your DHS is working every day to meet these threats.
    I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today, 
particularly as I can speak about the great men and women of 
DHS, the foot soldiers who protect us in the home fight. I 
thank you for your continued support of DHS. I remain 
continued--committed, rather, to working with Congress in 
protecting the American people.
    I look forward to answering your questions, sir, ma'am.

                         STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES
    Mr. Carter. Well, thank you, Secretary Kelly. We appreciate 
you being here.
    Mr. Secretary, you are one the longest serving cabinet 
members in this administration, having been confirmed on the 
job on January 20th. Since you have been at DHS, have you 
identified strategic imperatives for the department?
    Secretary Kelly. Great question, sir.
    One of the things I think that came to me right away when 
the took the organization--again, I can't speak enough about 
the men and women of DHS. They are the most criticized, 
maligned organization group of people in the Federal 
Government, and I have found them to be honorable men and women 
who take their jobs seriously. So that is one discovery.
    Another discovery is that there is an awful lot--despite 
the fact that Department of Homeland Security is a very 
disparate organization, it--there are many places, and Jeh 
Johnson really started this unity of effort thing, and I think 
it makes a lot of sense.
    My number two, and I think I might be the only one with a 
number two in the Federal Government right now, Elaine Duke, 
who was confirmed a couple of weeks ago and is on the job, 
among other rocks that are put into her path is this issue of 
how do we take what Jeh Johnson put in place, the unity of 
effort initiative, and really accelerate that and find places 
where it makes sense to find efficiencies and to try to get 
everyone kind of in a tent.
    I was shocked to find that throughout the agency there are 
a number of paying benefits schemes, that people in the Secret 
Service don't get the same--are not on the same pay scale as 
the people in INA, and the people that are--ICE don't stand in 
the same way from a paying benefits point of view as does, say 
CBP. Those are acquisition.
    I found that we had two parts of the organization going to 
the process of researching and developing, acquiring the same 
piece of equipment. You know, this is something that DOD 
mostly, almost entirely, because the United States Congress in 
1985, they solved that with a gold-wadded nickles kind of 
thing.
    So, I mean, it does work. So I am looking for those kind of 
things to increase the efficiency of the Department.
    But there are other aspects that I have learned, to say the 
least, and that is the highly politicized nature of what I do, 
of what the men and women of this Department do, and also press 
reporting.
    Now that said, in defense of the press and others, I don't 
think we had a particularly good approach to interacting with 
the press and, frankly, with the Hill. We have put first-class 
people in my liaison section in DHS and in the public affairs 
section. We are leaning forward as fast as possible to serve 
the needs of the United States Congress, quicker, certainly 
quicker, than it was done before. I remember during the process 
of being confirmed, almost every Member I talked to said you 
are the worst in the Federal Government for responding to 
letters or requests or whatever, and that is unacceptable, and 
we are changing that.
    The same thing with the media. We didn't have a very good 
outreach to explain what we are doing. What the media does with 
that information, of course, is up to them, but those are the 
kind of things, Mr. Chairman, that I found early on and doing 
the best I can to address.
                          DETENTION: CAPACITY
    Mr. Carter. Those are a lot of things that this committee 
has been concerned about, and we are, I think, pretty much in 
agreement that all of those things need to be fixed. So 
congratulations. You got a good eye.
    Mr. Secretary, the fiscal year 2018 budget proposes $49 
billion for enforcement of illegal migration, including 3.6 
billion for 51,379 detention beds and custody operations, an 
increase of 1 billion dollars and 12,055 detention beds. The 
average daily population of detainees has been steadily 
dropping since the President signed the executive order on 
border security and strengthening enforcement of our 
immigration laws.
    What methods and policies are DHS proposing to achieve such 
a dramatic uptick in detention capacity when the current trend 
for adult detention has slowly but steadily decreased over 
several months?
    Please explain the assumptions used to develop the budget 
and whether they are still valid and--well, that is enough.
    Secretary Kelly. Mr. Chairman, upfront, I think the actions 
that are being taken both on the border and in the interior 
will ultimately result in a pretty, pretty quick drop of the 
number of beds that we ultimately need. But let me deal with 
the border first.
    I mean you--I think you mentioned it in your comments. 
Somewhere in--very close to 70 percent drop in the number of 
illegal--of all--illegal migrants of all types moving up 
through that terribly dangerous network through Mexico.
    And not just central Americans, but primarily central 
Americans have been the travelers on that network, but 
individuals from all over the world as far away as Somalia, 
Pakistan, North Korea.
    So because of what they--they don't understand, and this is 
a good thing, what is going on right now in terms of the 
enforcement and what we are doing on the border that has caused 
them to delay their departure, if you will.
    And, by the way, working closely with the Central American 
countries, with the Mexican Government, of which I have a very, 
very close relationship, telling them what we are doing, 
working with them to try to convince their citizens to not pay 
a huge amount of money to them to get on that network, which, 
again, is very, very dangerous and abusive, to stay at home.
    And at the same time, working in another vector to--and, 
again, not really my job, but we put some energy behind this, 
and that is to help develop economically the Central American 
republics, particularly Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, 
of which with whom we have great relationships. So that is what 
we are doing on the border.
    And that has--in messaging, and that has resulted in really 
a 70 percent reduction in the movement of migrants. There is a 
lot of good news there, but to me, I think the first thing I 
think about, again, are the number of people that are not on 
that horrible network being abused, killed, in some cases, all 
the way up the 1,500 miles or so into the United States.
    And, again, I can't emphasize enough the close relationship 
we have working relationships at every level with the Mexicans 
not to mention the Central American countries.
    Interior enforcement is something--and, again, I have only 
been in this job 4 months, but interior enforcement, that is to 
say developing target packages by ICE, working oftentimes, with 
local law enforcement to go after specific ideally--ideally, 
specific illegal aliens inside the United States that are also 
criminals, developing those packages. There are no sweeps. 
There are no drop-ins to churches. We don't do that, or medical 
facilities or schools.
    But the interior enforcement, to ideally, go after 
criminals who are also illegal and put them into the system if 
they are not already in the system. And frequently they are, 
and they just have dropped out of the system. And we need a 
place to hold them. So the interior enforcement has gone up.
    And--but ideally, in my mind, over time, we will not need 
nearly as many--as many beds, because the legal justice process 
that is also in place, much of it belongs, of course, to the 
Department of Justice, the legal justice process of immigration 
courts and that kind of thing, will return people to their 
countries of origin much, much faster than it does today.
    I mean, the real--the real sticking point right now in what 
we are doing is that DOJ (Department of Justice) and Attorney 
General Sessions and his staff are working hard at hiring more 
judges so we can process people through and ultimately, the 
number of beds we will need will go down, I think, pretty 
steeply.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard.
                          DETENTION: POLICIES
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Mr. Secretary, it is sometimes forgotten 
that ICE detention is, in fact, civil detention and not 
criminal detention, and therefore should not be used as a 
punishment or as a deterrent.
    In fact, the D.C. District Court imposed a preliminary 
injunction in 2014 preventing the Department from using 
deterrence as a factor in the context of family detention.
    I mention this because you indicated a few months ago that 
you were considering a policy of separating children and 
parents who are apprehended after crossing the border as a way 
of deterring future migration.
    I believe you subsequently indicated that you will not 
institute such a policy, but I wanted to ask you more broadly 
about deterrence as a factor in detention.
    Do you believe that deterrence is a permissible 
consideration when making custody decisions? And does ICE 
currently have any formal or informal policies that it be 
considered?
    Secretary Kelly. Well, the courts have told me I can't do 
it, so that is where I am on this topic. The people that we 
are--put into detention are people who are--we either consider 
to be a flight risk, which many are, or a danger to society. So 
those are the two general categories.
    Many, many people at--ICE takes into custody that are then 
not put into detention but given mon--you know, we put them in 
monitoring, sometimes we put ankle bracelets on them, those 
kinds of things.
    So the ones that go into detention, again, are dangerous 
folks, men and women, or they are a flight risk, which, 
unfortunately, many of them are. As I think the ranking member 
knows, that there is an awful lot of people that kind of just 
disappear, you know, that come into the country illegally, that 
disappear into our society. We don't know where they are.
    Most of them, as you say, as you pointed out, and I think 
Mrs. Lowey did as well, they stay under the radar, they don't 
commit crimes, and those are ultimately are not the people that 
we look for.
    But for those two factors are why we need the beds and why 
detention is an option for us.
                         DETENTION: FACILITIES
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Most ICE detainees are housed in 
dedicated facilities, but a substantial number are confined in 
the same facilities as those charged with criminal acts. ICE 
detainees should not be treated like criminals or suspected 
criminals. So this underscores the need for strong civil 
confinement standards.
    And I was alarmed to see that in your budget request, you 
intend to weaken ICE detention standards in order to attract 
more local jurisdictions as detention providers.
    Is the impetus for weakening standards the need for more 
detention space to implement the President's executive order on 
immigration enforcement?
    Secretary Kelly. First of all, the standard--as I have 
learned, and as kind of a side comment, I was asked by Jeh 
Johnson long before I ever knew I was going to be sitting in 
this seat, to participate in a study of ICE facilities 
nationwide. And I did that and was a member of that study. I 
was in all the discussions, went on trips with him, but I had 
to drop off, because when I was--as soon as I was named to this 
job, I dropped off of that.
    But the point is, I know a fair amount about the conditions 
and not only the concerns, not only what the private and law 
enforcement people say about detention facilities that ICE 
runs, but also what the agenda groups, what advocacy groups 
talk about, so I get a sense of both sides of that. That is 
very helpful for me to understand the issue.
    But the point is, what I have learned is the ICE detention 
standards are well beyond the standards that even the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons has in terms of prisoner or detainee in this 
case, housing and care.
    As we seek to enter into, if you will, rental agreements 
with local law enforcement or counties to have access to their 
beds, for generally, short periods of time, in order to do 
that, we have--we are looking at lowering our standards so that 
we can enter into agreements.
    But still, the agreements, the detention, conditions of 
detention will be much higher than what is accepted--what is 
acceptable in either the Federal system or the State system.
    So, yes, lowering it so we can have some access, but it is 
not lowering it to the point--by no means lowering it to the 
point where there is mistreatment or conditions that would--
would not be appropriate from a humanitarian point of view.
                    DETENTION: FACILITIES STANDARDS
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. Okay. I guess the point is that, it 
seems to me that all detainees deserve the same level of 
protections for whatever amount of time that they spend in 
detention.
    And so that is what brings my concern about having 
different standards in different facilities.
    I would also like to point out that the statement 
accompanying the fiscal year 2017 omnibus included a directive 
that you should interpret as a caution against weakening 
detention standards. Specifically, it requires that you submit 
a report to the committee 30 days in advance justifying the 
rationale for ICE signing or renewing contracts that do not 
require adherence to the most recent detention standards.
    In addition, it requires a report on the Department's plans 
to bring all detention facilities under the newest standards.
    In anticipation of that reporting requirement and directive 
from Congress, does ICE still plan to pursue a lax set of 
standards for local and county jails? And what are the 
challenges and obstacles that you see in moving more facilities 
under the 2011 detention standards? And should we be relying 
less on local and county facilities if they are unable to 
commit to detention standards that are appropriate for ICE 
detainees?
    That is a long list of questions. I am sorry.
    Secretary Kelly. It is. No. Again, lowering the standards 
doesn't does not result in any way, shape, or form a detainees 
being in any way inhumanely treated, but it does give us access 
to some of the State and local jails.
    Our preference is to put detainees into our ICE facilities. 
And generally speaking, the way they operate, they stay--ICE 
operates, they stay in those facilities for minimum periods of 
time.
    Oftentimes, it is just until they go through the relatively 
short process until we decide what to do--they decide what to 
do with them.
    So, again, I go back to it gives us some flexibility. The 
standards will not be anything approaching--anything 
approaching inhumane with no dignity, and we will obviously, 
report to the Congress. And it probably is worthwhile to offer 
right now a brief from ICE, maybe a member brief or maybe 
recommend a hearing so they can come talk about those things in 
detail.
    Ms. Roybal-Allard. My time is up. I have some follow-up 
questions, but Mr. Chairman, thank you for the generosity on my 
time.
    Mr. Carter. And I need to inform the committee, it looks 
like your time remaining clocks are not working. At least mine 
is not. So we are keeping time over here.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. I thought that means we can go on 
forever.
    Mr. Carter. We try to generally inform you of your time.
    Mr. Frelinghuysen.
                      CYBERSECURITY: CYBER ATTACKS
    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am sitting between two Texans, 
probably a pretty good place to be.
    The term resilient, I sort of mentioned earlier that the 
whole issue of, you know, equipment and training. You have an 
amazing number of organizations under your umbrella.
    Have you done an evaluation as to how resilient they are 
when it comes to cyber attacks?
    Do you have a system, which has graded your--those under 
your purview? We had, of course, as you are aware, the most 
massive cyber attack, I think, perhaps the world has ever seen 
just within recent weeks.
    Have you done--do you have a constant review of the many 
systems under your purview?
    Secretary Kelly. Yes, sir. The answer to that, the very 
short answer is, yes.
    And since you bring it up, the reason--I mean, this was a 
joint effort, but on the morning that the ransom attack 
started, I would say DHS was among the very first people, which 
is our job, to recognize that it started. And as it grew, and 
it grew fast, DHS, with other aspects of the U.S. Government, 
but DHS has the lead in terms of defending our dot-gov, our 
government with the exception of and Intel nets, our dot-gov 
nets and have tremendous partnerships with all of U.S. 
industry, whether they are financial institution--everybody 
that wants to play, that want--and a lot of them do play.
    So when that Ransomware attack started, I would have to 
tell you, went to the sit room, the situation room, we had some 
immediate meetings on it. I was proud that everyone, whether it 
was NSA (National Security Agency), FBI (Federal Bureau of 
Investigation), everybody, was deferring at all times to my 
command center that deals 24/7 watching the nets within cyber 
defenses. And I was incredibly proud to have them all deferring 
to DHS.
    So as we saw that runaway event that ultimately infected 
huge numbers of systems and computers in Europe and the Middle 
East, I mean, everywhere, Asia, hundreds and hundreds and 
hundreds of thousands of contaminated systems and individual 
computers.
    And because of the interagency efforts of the United 
States, but to a large degree because of what DHS does in its 
cybersecurity mission, I can't tell you, but let me just say 
that the number of systems infected in our country were 
miniscule.
    We defended the country from the biggest cyber onslaught in 
history, and we were successful in keeping it out of our 
country with the exception of a tiny, tiny, tiny number of 
computers.
    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Frelinghuysen.
    Before I go forward, I have just been informed to expect 
multiple votes, at 4:15 p.m., which could take up to an hour, 
so we are going to have to limit everyone to one question as we 
go forward.
    Mrs. Lowey.
                       FEMA GRANTS: PROGRAM CUTS
    Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, I was disappointed by the significant 
proposed cuts for FEMA preparedness grant programs. The UASI 
program, which helps the most at-risk urban areas such as New 
York, prevent and prepare for terrorist attacks would be cut by 
26 percent, and the State Homeland Security Grant Program will 
be slashed by more than 25 percent.
    Overall, the fiscal year 2018 budget proposes a cut of 919 
million dollars to FEMA grant programs that really help law 
enforcement prevent and respond to terrorism and other 
disasters.
    To put that in perspective, you would cut vital funds to 
protect the top terror targets in the U.S. by 31 percent, which 
is equal to roughly half of what you are proposing to build a 
wall on the Mexican border that is not needed.
    State and local jurisdictions just cannot effectively plan 
for, establish, and maintain their preparedness programs when 
support from their Federal partner is inconsistent and subject 
to major deviations.
    Mr. Secretary, could you please share with us the impetus 
for proposing such drastic cuts to the grant programs? Is it 
based on any sort of analysis that our States, major urban 
areas and other jurisdictions are well prepared for terrorist 
threats without Federal assistance?
    Secretary Kelly. I would offer to you that in the 120 days, 
give or take, that I have had this job, I have visited a number 
of our largest cities, New York, Chicago, Boston, McAllen, 
Texas, a number of places, met with the mayors, met with the 
police chiefs. I have been to a couple of very large police and 
sheriff, separate organizations that I have met here in D.C. a 
couple of months ago, met with them, talked to them a lot.
    I met, interacted with the National Governors Association 
that was here in D.C., which was almost all of the--I think 48 
of the governors. And the point is, the State and local men and 
women of law enforcement and the people that we work with, FEMA 
(Federal Emergency Management Agency) works with, are very, 
very highly capable.
    You know, there was a time, I would offer, back before 9/11 
that we didn't think too much about it, because terrorism had 
not really come to our country, and many of these grants and 
initiatives, of course, were put in place after that. As you 
might imagine, the men and women of law enforcement, locally 
and on the State level with Federal help have risen to the 
occasion. There is very, very capable FEMA type people that are 
in the States and indeed many cities have them.
    I wouldn't say that these funds are not very helpful for 
those States and localities, but I would offer that it isn't as 
grim as you describe in terms of taking them away. What I mean 
is if you take away this money, which does--the budget does 
some of that, their efforts against terrorism and against other 
aspects of, you know, disasters, will immediately collapse.
    So my offer would be that we were looking for money, and we 
evaluated a number of different places, obviously, and we took 
where we thought we could take from.
    But, again, I am absolutely confident that the men and 
women out there in the hinder lands of the United States have 
risen to the occasion over the last 15 years since 9/11 and are 
very, very good at what they do.
    Mrs. Lowey. Well, thank you for giving me the opportunity 
to ask the question, Mr. Chairman.
    But I am really surprised, Mr. Secretary, with great 
respect, at your response. There is no question, for example, 
in New York City these people are capable, and they are 
carrying out all their activities with distinction. But I will 
check with them. I haven't heard that they don't need that 
money, and that that money isn't essential.
    And when--if New York is a target, and it is beyond my 
comprehension that you could think it is okay to make those 
deep cuts. Thank you.
    Secretary Kelly. I didn't say they don't need the money or 
they--I just said that we have found places where we think that 
the funds are no longer needed in the way that they once were.
    Mrs. Lowey. Okay. I will be happy to get back to you. But I 
would like that response in writing, and I will check with the 
people who are responsible for these programs in New York and 
maybe have them document how essential these funds are.

    &amp;lt;GRAPHIC&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TIF1&amp;gt;T7050A.049
    Mrs. Lowey. Thank you very much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey.
    Mr. Culberson.
                          OPERATION STREAMLINE
    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your service to our 
country and the Marine Corps and for your prudence, for the 
President's prudence in being careful in spending our 
constituents' very scarce, hard-earned and very precious tax 
dollars. And in particular, I want to thank you and the 
President for focusing on restoring the rule of law, which is 
one thing that unites us as Americans.
    We understand, and this country, really, one of the first 
in the world to understand that our liberty lies in law 
enforcement. That is a fundamental principle of who we are as 
Americans, and we really appreciate you focusing on that.
    And I also want to say that Congressman Duncan Hunter, Sr., 
spearheaded the effort to build a wall in the southern 
California border, which has been working very successfully, 
and Israelis know how effective a wall could be.
    It makes sense in large parts of the border, the Pecos 
river country out in West Texas may not be as necessary out 
there, but a wall make good sense. But above all, we appreciate 
your focus on law enforcement.
    And existing law is very clear, has been on the books since 
1950s, that an individual crossing the southern border is 
subject to up to 6 months imprisonment to enter the country 
illegally.
    On the second offense, they are subject to imprisonment for 
up to 2 years. And I wanted to in particular bring your 
attention to Judge Alia Moses' very successful effort in the 
Del Rio sector. My good friend, Henry Cuellar and I are well 
acquainted with her.
    Judge Moses and the Border Patrol in the Del Rio sector 
with the support of the Department of Justice, they use their 
good hearts and their commonsense in a compassionate way to 
ensure that existing law is enforced uniformly and fairly.
    And as a result before you came into--President Trump came 
into office and the promise of enforcement of the law which 
resulted in such a precipitous decline in illegal crossings, 
Judge Moses as I recall, Henry, would just simply enforcing 
existing law, in the Del Rio sector, and they saw the lowest 
level of illegal crossings since Border Patrol began keeping 
records, as I recall, Henry.
    And you and I have worked together closely to support Judge 
Moses and her efforts. I want to bring her to your attention, 
Mr. Secretary.
    The program that she put in place is called Operation 
Streamline, and I would encourage you to try to expand that up 
and down the border.
    As chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and 
Appropriation Subcommittee, I will do my part to help ensure 
the Department of Justice resources are focused there with 
additional prosecutors, personnel, U.S. marshals to make sure 
that folks are processed and handled in a way that protects 
everyone's due process rights and to ensure that people are 
handled expeditiously by immigration judges.
    Because you are exactly right, we need to make sure those 
immigration judges are there on the border to handle people who 
come across and receive that notice to appear, which is, I 
believe, Henry, they call those permisso.
    Mr. Cuellar. Permisso.
    Mr. Culberson. In previous administrations, they got the 
notice to appear, they call it permisso. And they were gone, 
disappeared, never to show up again.
    So simply by enforcing the law, ensuring that people to 
show up in front of those immigration judges, or appear before 
a judge like Judge Moses up and down the border from 
Brownsville to San Diego, you can have a dramatic effect on 
protecting our southern border, ensuring the free flow of legal 
goods and people entering the country illegally.
    Because we all know we need that good relationship with 
Mexico to have people cross back and forth legally and freely 
with goods and commerce and for workers.
    But you have got to start--it begins with law enforcement.
    So I wanted to ask you, Mr. Secretary, about Operation 
Streamline, if you are familiar with it. And could you speak 
about what currently is happening under the Trump 
administration in your leadership if an individual is 
apprehended on the southern border, and when and how does DHS 
decide to give them expedited removal proceedings before a 
judge like Judge Moses?
    Secretary Kelly. I am not--and I will get smart on 
Operation Streamline, and it sounds like I ought to go down to 
Del Rio and visit with the Judge----
    Mr. Culberson. She is doing a great job.
    Secretary Kelly. One of the things, again, I have learned 
in this job, this immigration thing is the most complicated--I 
mean, if we try to make it any more complex and hard to 
understand, we couldn't have done it any better.
    But all sorts of categories. Right?
    Mr. Culberson. Right.
    Secretary Kelly. They will catch someone, say, a Mexican 
that comes across on our side of the border wrong, 
essentially----
    Mr. Culberson. She will give them a week, You know. She is 
not like a----
    Secretary Kelly. But pretty quick they can say, I don't 
want to enter the system, and they can go right back home.
    One of the things we found--and, again, an anecdote, but in 
talking to a CBP officer, I think the second week I was on the 
job, went down to McAllen, Texas, and just walked the dirt and 
the train and the river's edge with the real people that 
understand the illegal immigration drug movement and all of 
that, the CBP officers, great men and women each.
    And they said, you know, sir, we will find--we will stop 
traffickers, Mexican traffickers, on our side of the border. I 
have been here 14 years. I know the names of many of them, 
because we will pick them up. They will be with illegal aliens, 
the traffickers, coyotes, as they are called, and they will 
say--they will opt to just simply go back to Mexico. And then 
whether it is 1 month later or 1 year later, they will capture 
them again, and they will go back.
    So one of the things they started doing is holding them and 
starting the process of prosecuting them for human trafficking.
    The cost, then--and this is important in terms of reduction 
in the numbers that are crossing the border, the cost of going 
from, say, El Salvador to the United States, the fare, if you 
will, to travel on the network and get into the United States 
grew from an astronomical figure to the kind of people, simple 
people, peasants, mostly, from the Central American republic, 
good people, $4,000, life savings, an incredible amount of 
money to them.
    Mr. Culberson. Yes, it is hard.
    Secretary Kelly. Now it is $12,000 or $15,000. So they 
can't afford it. So that is one of the factors in--that simple 
thing starting to arrest and prosecute them.
    Mr. Culberson. Absolutely.
    I want to be sure to mention that also I learned from Judge 
Moses that she cannot seize the assets of human smugglers. That 
is the law--a change in law we need to make.
    Secretary Kelly. Right.
    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.
    Secretary Kelly. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Carter. Mr. Cuellar.
              BORDER SECURITY: WALL ALONG SOUTHERN BORDER
    Mr. Cuellar. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for this 
opportunity.
    Mr. Secretary, I want to say thank you for what you do, 
what your men and women do. I appreciate it. I am from Laredo, 
Texas. I represent the border. I live there. My family is 
there. I breathe the air. I drink the water. So I don't just go 
in and visit for a few hours and take off and think that I know 
the border better than some of the people that have lived there 
all my life.
    And I have to say, during my time here, I have seen 
Secretaries come and go. We will probably see you come and go 
with all respect. My only advice is: Understand the system that 
we are in, the executive branch--and sometimes some of us might 
disagree with you. I don't think it is correct for you to tell 
Members of Congress to shut up. If we disagree--some us might 
agree with you more than others, but I am just saying, 
otherwise, it is going to be a long term for you if you do 
that. I think you did that within 90 days after you got sworn 
in.
    I want to focus on the wall. I don't support the wall for 
several reasons. One, private property rights: In Texas, we 
respect private property rights. It is dear to us, number one.
    And, number two, the cost: A regular fence will be $6.5 
million per mile compared to $1 million of technology. I think 
Mr. Taylor, who has been in the military, there is a lot of 
technology out there that works very well for the military that 
should work very well for us down there. That is number two.
    Number three, environmental or the International Water 
Commission: Sir, there was a treaty between the U.S. and Mexico 
as to where you can put barriers, and that is an issue that we 
have to look at.
    Number four, overstays: 40 percent of the people that we 
have here are overstays. So you can put the most beautiful wall 
that you want to, but they are either going to fly in, drive 
through a bridge, or come through a boat. The report that came 
out, that Homeland released 2 days ago, May 22, talks about 
overstays. Over 40 percent of the 11, 12 million are overstays. 
In fiscal year, there were 630,000 visitors that failed to 
leave the U.S., far exceeding the 415,000 people that came in 
across the border. So more overstays than people coming across 
or that were intercepted across the U.S.-Mexico border.
    What was interesting is, according to Homeland, there were 
more Canadians that overstayed than Mexicans. I think your 
report said 120,000 Canadians with expired visas are still 
believed to be living in the U.S., compared to 47,000 Mexicans 
on that. And that is--probably those stats are not correct or 
accurate because I think you only looked at plane and boat and 
didn't look at land crossings also. And I think the visa stay 
should be one.
    The other thing, finally, number five, why I don't support 
the wall is natural barriers. I think President Trump on April 
acknowledged that there are natural barriers to the border. If 
I can show you--I support a wall; this is the most beautiful 
that wall I support, Lucille, is Big Bend. Have you seen the 
Big Bend? I mean, those are walls. If you want to see walls, 
those are walls that we have. I don't think you can come in and 
put another wall on top of these cliffs that we have, number 
one. I think you would agree with me. The second thing is if 
you go down to my lower part of the river, the Rio Grande, 
which is a natural barrier, doesn't go straight. As you know, 
it snakes up and down. And this is my district down there. And 
the U.S. side I believe is in the top part. Look at the river 
the way it snakes. So, either you follow it--and I have taken a 
small low plane with Michael McCaul from Laredo all the way to 
Brownsville, going just a few miles an hour, flying over, just 
snaking over. And it is going to be very hard to put a fence, 
unless you take private property rights that we have.
    So all I am asking you is that you work with the local 
Border Patrol, work with us, and just say that we can't just 
use, you know, the fence. We know what happened to the Berlin 
Wall. We know what happened to the Chinese--to the Great Wall 
of China. We know what happened to that. And I am just saying 
that we just have to be smart on how we secure the border. We 
spend $18 billion a year on border security on the 1-yard line 
called the U.S. border. But you remember the last time you and 
I were together with Chairman Carter and Kay. We were on the 
southern border of Mexico, with $80 million that we put there 
to help Mexico secure the southern border, $80 million compared 
to $18 billion. Did you know that they actually stopped more 
people coming across than the whole Border Patrol did?
    So all I am saying, Mr. Secretary, is we want to work with 
you. I know it is a very difficult job that you have. Some of 
us have been living this for a long time. We want to see 
legitimate trade, tourism, not impede that. And we just want to 
work with you. So just to conclude--my time is up--some of us 
want to work with you, and please take advantage of our 
expertise.
    Secretary Kelly. I probably am on dangerous ground here. If 
I could, Mr. Chairman, could I just make a comment?
    Mr. Carter. Yes.
    Mr. Cuellar. I am turning on my mic in case I have to 
respond.
    Secretary Kelly. Two comments really. Since I have been in 
this job, everything that the Congressman said about the border 
and where to build it and where not to build it, there might be 
places where we do it, there might be other places we don't: I 
have been saying that since day 1.
    Mr. Cuellar. Yes, you have.
    Secretary Kelly. What you said about the southern border, 
when I was on Active Duty, I helped the Mexicans construct 
their southern border strategy, helped them implement it under 
the radar quietly, and it has worked very effectively. They 
stopped 160,000 illegal migrants last year and returned them to 
their countries of origin humanely, great partners.
    We stopped more than that last year. But the point is their 
southern strategy works.
    You have also probably heard me say that our--the 1-yard-
line stand day in and day out doesn't work, that the protection 
of the southern border starts 1,500 miles south. I have said 
that repeatedly. So everything you said about what we should be 
doing and thinking about, I have been saying and thinking about 
for 120 days.
                       CRITICISM OF DHS WORKFORCE
    My ``shut up'' comment, the one thing, sir, with all due 
respect that is different between certainly my experience in 
the U.S. military and my experience now is that the men and 
women in the U.S. military, you can throw rocks or criticize--
and God knows we deserve some criticism--senior military 
officers, you can criticize the policy of what they are trying 
to execute in the world, but the one thing that we never hear 
from certainly this institution is criticism of the rank-and-
file men and women that put their lives on the line in the U.S. 
military every day. You never hear that.
    In this job, all I heard day in and day out, ``Nazis,'' 
``storm troop tactics,'' prejudice about the men and women, the 
foot soldiers, if you will, that stand on our border or inside 
our country and protect it. And I would just ask that criticize 
me, criticize the Trump policies, but please recognize that my 
men and women are doing the same kind of thing day in and day 
out as our military men and women are and, in a sense, give 
them a break. And that is what the ``shut up'' comment was 
about.
    Mr. Cuellar. Right. Well, Mr. Chairman, I just need to 
respond quickly. Let me just say this: Nobody has attacked the 
men and women. I mean, I think they are attacking the policy.
    I have been attacked also. I have been called--because you 
and I agree on a lot of things, whether you like----
    Mr. Carter. I am sorry, Mr. Cuellar.
    Mr. Cuellar. I appreciate it.
    Mr. Carter. The votes have started. I am going to try to 
keep this hearing going. I will stay here. I hope you will have 
somebody here to stay with me, and the rest of you go vote. 
Come back as soon as you can.
    Mr. Cuellar. Four votes, motion to recommit.
    Mr. Cuellar. We can come back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. That is not going to work. You have four 
votes and a motion to recommit.
    Mr. Carter. Mr. Fleischmann, we are going to do one more 
round of questions and maybe get back to Mr. Price, maybe get 
to you.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. I doubt you will get to me.
    Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Carter. They are now telling me it will be an hour's 
worth of votes.
    Okay. Mr. Fleischmann.
         BORDER SECURITY: LEGAL MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND COMMERCE
    Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, let me first start by saying thank you for 
your tremendous service to this country in the United States 
Marine Corps, for stepping up now and being Secretary at this 
most difficult time in our Nation's history. You are a great 
American, and I am infinitely grateful for the job that you are 
doing, sir.
    I will limit my time to one question. Like the rest of the 
Federal Government, CPB faces competing funding demands in a 
tight budget environment. Much of Congress and the 
administration's focus has rightly been on physical 
infrastructure, staffing needs, and emerging technologies like 
aerial drones.
    While I agree these are vital, DHS should not ignore proven 
effective technologies that facilitate the safe and efficient 
flow of legitimate trade and travel across the border. What is 
DHS' plan, sir, to incorporate effective port of entry 
technologies into their border security plan?
    Secretary Kelly. One of the things Mr. Trump said to me 
early on when we discussed what his thoughts were relative to 
the Southwest border, he said: You know, Kelly, the one thing 
we can't stop--in fact, if anything, if you can speed it up--is 
the normal movement of legal people in vehicles and whatnot, 
commercial movement, north and south of the border.
    On the northern border, the Canadians will say we need to 
thin the border, which is we don't have the same issues on the 
northern border, but the point is to take every opportunity to 
try to thin that southern border.
    Longer term plans are to build more capacity at the ports 
of entry. I had my science and technology people, who are 
phenomenal, I asked them just today--we have good technology 
down there now for vehicles to pass through so that we can see 
inside them, see if there are people or drugs--what is the next 
generation? And then let's skip that one and get to the next 
one. So I believe we can speed things up. It is fast now: 
Millions of people back and forth every day with not so much as 
a slowdown most of the time in their vehicles.
    There are certain indicators we look for that would then 
put it into secondary. So we look for drugs or people for some 
of that. It is an amazing amount of movement north and south, 
legal movement, through that border. So we are redoubling our 
efforts, sir, to look for ways to get even better at that but, 
at the same time, stop more of the illicit movement of not only 
drugs, of which it is massive, but also working with the 
Mexicans--and we work very closely with the them; I can't 
emphasize enough--about how we can move items faster through 
the border.
    Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, sir.
    And, again, let me reiterate my full support, and I look 
forward to working with you, sir.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Fleischmann.
    Mr. Ruppersberger.
    Mr. Ruppersberger. I won't be able to talk. I just want to 
say how I respect your career. I was on Defense Appropriations 
and ranking on Intel, and I have watched you. And I will tell 
you, with you and General Mattis being appointed in the 
beginning of this administration, I have been able to sleep 
better at night. Now that doesn't mean I am always going to 
agree with you. And I would like to meet with you later on the 
issue of cybersecurity, port security, a lot of these different 
issues that we need to deal with. Thank you.
    Secretary Kelly. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Carter. Mr. Price.
                     CENTRAL AMERICAN RELATIONSHIPS
    Mr. Price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, welcome. I am glad to see you. And I want to 
just say that I remember your previous career, our interaction, 
in particular, in 2014, in Guatemala, an enlightening 
conversation about what the United States' approach in 
particular to the triangle countries should be--El Salvador, 
Guatemala, and Honduras. The source of so many children, 
unaccompanied children, and mothers and so on. And you made it 
very, very clear that this was not mainly a challenge for 
border security. And you wrote a very well-regarded piece in 
the Military Times that had a huge influence I think on this 
country's policies toward these countries. And you said just 
recently, you can't have these goal-line stands on the 1-foot 
line at the official points of entry. You have got to approach 
this problem in the countries of origin. So you have been a 
major influence on our policy in that regard.
    It does however bring us to the wall, to the wall.
    Now you wouldn't know it from President Trump's rhetoric, 
but there were over 700 miles of fencing already down there. I 
know about that because I was chairman of this subcommittee for 
many of the years when that fence was constructed. And we 
required segment-by-segment analysis. We asked for 
environmental impact studies. We asked for comparisons of 
fencing versus other kinds of ways of securing the border. We 
had a good deal of oversight over that process, and the fence 
got built. We also doubled the number of Customs and Border 
Patrol agents.
    Now President Trump has almost a fixation it seems on this 
wall. And I wonder: Is that really compatible with the idea of 
a layered defense that you earlier expressed? Particularly, I 
wonder what kind of reaction you have to the foreign ops bill. 
These countries, these very countries we are talking about: El 
Salvador, support, the economic support and development fund, 
cut by a third, $65 million down to 45; Guatemala cut by a 
third, $112 million down to $77 million; Honduras cut by a 
third, $93 million down to $67 million. Where is that coming 
from? What does that have to do with the kind of advocacy that 
you and others were very powerful in making about the need to 
enable those countries to control their gangs, to control their 
own security, but also to help their own people with all kinds 
of needs that might enable people to stay in those countries?
    And then, finally, if we do move forward with this wall, I 
expect that we will have more analysis than we have right now. 
And I want you to confirm that. You are talking about three 
segments. There is not much of a justification as to why that 
is the best alternative, how it compares to other alternatives, 
what kind of changes might be required, such as the levee 
fences we required, the changes in location we required. We 
need this kind of congressional interaction if we are going to 
move forward with this project.
    Secretary Kelly. Sir, on the issue of--I will start with 
the Central American countries. Five years ago, when I began my 
tour down in Miami, the three countries the northern tier 
countries, the Central American republics, were in fact the 
most dangerous countries on the planet. They had murder rates 
that were astronomical. All of those countries, because of the 
help we provided--and the help is some assistance from the 
United States' Treasury, so from the United States taxpayer, 
but a lot of hands-on work with the U.S. military, United 
States Southern Command working with them, helping them get 
better. There is a particularly useful program, INL, within the 
Department of State working with the police. And still horrific 
murder rates, but cut by a third. Where talking about they were 
where Colombia was at the beginning of Plan Colombia and 
working toward a miracle that is Colombia today.
    So the point is the money has been very, very helpful. The 
contact has been very, very helpful. One of the things we are 
doing is not only messaging through the religious leaders, the 
political leaders in Central America, to convince their 
citizens not to make that horribly dangerous journey up. We--
the energy behind it has been DHS--have organized a major 
conference in Miami, cosponsored with Mexico. We are bringing 
in Canada, Costa Rica, Panama, Spain, the EU, most importantly 
in the region, Colombia. It will be the President--Vice 
President, rather, will spend the first day down, the 
prosperity day. The Departments of Treasury and Commerce will 
come down. IEDB will come in. The point is to accelerate the 
private investment into those countries, and they are ready for 
that. And then the second day will be more of a security day 
that Homeland Security will run.
    So we are, in fact, still--I am still focused on that 
country and, of course, that region of the world. And of 
course, most of their problems revolve around our drug use in 
the United States, the vast majority of the problems, and I 
make that point all of the time.
            BORDER SECURITY: WALL DIVIDE THE SOUTHERN BORDER
    On the wall, where there is physical barrier, it works. I 
acknowledge the fact I don't live on the border. But I will 
also tell you that, when I visit the border, I talk to--every 
trip down there--I talk to the CBP people, the local law 
enforcement, the local business community, and the local 
mayors, El Paso and other places. So I get down there, and I 
talk to them. The number one concern the mayors and whatnot 
have is the free flow of commerce. I have already addressed 
that.
    The police like what we are doing and the partnership they 
have with CBP, and CBP has a great partnership with their 
Mexican counterparts on the other side.
    Where we have physical barrier, it works. Where there are 
places that, whether it is environmental reasons why, watershed 
reasons, whatever, there are places where it is unlikely we 
will ever need a wall. As far as the kind of wall--and you 
mentioned the levee system or the levee wall down the Texas. 
That is a place where a concrete structure would make sense. As 
you know, there is already a concrete wall down there that is 
reinforcing the levee system. That is good for the south Texas. 
There are other places, frankly, and again, I know I don't live 
on the border, but I do talk to people that live on the border 
and work this issue of the border, both local law enforcement 
and my people, CBP people. And they have told me what they 
want. They want a see-through wall, that they can see on the 
other side what is going on. And just as importantly to them, 
and I hadn't ever thought of this, so the Mexicans can see them 
on the other side to understand that the wall, the barrier, is 
also backed up with the great men and women of CBP.
    So what we are doing right now is looking specifically at 
where we think--where CBP and local law enforcement thinks they 
need additional physical barrier. And then we are running a 
competition right now that I am not involved in, because of 
contractual issues and everything else, procurement issues, 
running a competition of what physical barrier is the best to 
construct along those places, along the border where it makes 
sense to put physical barrier. It may be concrete wall in one 
place. It may be a bollard type fencing system in another 
place. And, frankly, it may be no physical barrier at all in 
other places. So we will certainly keep the Congress informed, 
sir.
    Mr. Carter. Mr. Harris.
    Mr. Harris. Absolutely, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you. Obviously, your reputation is 
impeccable. As the chairman said, that is why you are the 
longest serving Secretary.
    I agree with my colleague from Maryland. I look forward to 
working with you.
    First of all, look, I agree with the ranking member on a 
lot of things. But I disagree with her about not taking the 
border wall seriously. You are on the front lines of our war on 
drugs right now. The greatest killer of young Americans right 
now is heroin, and 90 percent of it crosses our southern 
border. And if you, as in your statement, say a border wall 
system will deny access to drug- and alien-smuggling 
organizations where you plan to build it in this fiscal year's 
allocations, I support it, and I take it seriously.
               IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT: SANCTUARY CITIES
    With regard to, just briefly, sanctuary cities, I have got 
all kinds of people playing politics with this, local officials 
who think that they--pretend that they can write immigration 
law. They can't. But they should help the Federal agencies 
enforce it. I am glad that a rewrite of 8 U.S.C. 1373 in the 
President's proposal.
                  IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT: H-2B VISAS
    Finally, just one thing about that that is important to my 
district: The omnibus gave you the authority, after 
consultation with the Secretary of Labor, to adjust the H-2B 
caps and to adjust them where basically to where we would bring 
it to a level that would allow the returning workers to not 
count on under the caps. I urge you to do it. The businesses in 
my district are desperate. The summer season is coming up. We 
need it for various industries in my district. I urge you to 
expedite that if you can.
    And I yield back.
                               JONES ACT
    Mr. Palazzo [presiding]. Mr. Harris yields back.
    I am sitting in for the chairman for a minute. I am going 
to make my question real quick, and then we are hopefully going 
to get to Congressman Taylor.
    Mr. Secretary, I believe and I hope you agree that the 
Jones Act protects our U.S. shipbuilding capability from being 
hollowed out by foreign subsidies and cheap Labor and keeps the 
U.S. maritime industry strong. I want to ask you about your 
Department's compliance with the statutory prohibition 
contained in the Jones Act on foreign ships, crewed by foreign 
workers, flying a foreign flag, from transporting merchandise 
between points in the U.S.
    I was extremely disappointed to see that CBP recently 
withdrew a proposal to revoke and modify a number of the letter 
rulings concerning the transportation of merchandise on the 
Outer Continental Shelf that CBP itself has publicly admitted 
are inconsistent with the statute. In essence, CBP was, through 
this effort of revoking the old letter ruling, attempting to 
get back into compliance with the law, but now has stalled out.
    I know you believe in the rule of law. So can you tell us 
when CBP will revoke these letter rulings and actually start 
enforcing the law?
    Secretary Kelly. Congressman, one of the--very early on in 
my time in Homeland Security, this issue was briefed to me, and 
of course, I didn't have and still do not have a Commissioner 
of CBP, but the number two career at the time came in and gave 
me a brief rundown on this. And there were three options: kind 
of yes, no, and study it.
    And I am--generally speaking, when someone comes in and 
says we need to study this a little bit more, that in my mind 
is a kick-the-can-down-the-road kind of tactic. And I addressed 
that with the team. And I said: What is best right now for 
America, to make these decisions relative to foreign flag, U.S. 
flag?
    And they said: The best thing right now is for us to--it is 
so complicated and has wide-ranging impacts, the best thing to 
do is to do a comprehensive study.
    And that is the direction we are in.
    Mr. Palazzo. Well, I will be submitting more questions for 
the record, but I believe the law is clear on this, and if you 
have to choose between a foreign flag or an American flag, you 
have to choose America first. And with that--I am done asking 
my questions, and I will open it up to Congressman Taylor.
                 OFF-THE-SHELF TECHNOLOGY: ACQUISITION
    Mr. Taylor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. I appreciate 
your service before, and now, of course, I know you have a very 
difficult job.
    I will just make a couple of statements real quick, and 
then I will submit some questions so we can get over there and 
vote.
    Number one, I want foot stomp on what Dr. Harris said about 
the H-2B visas, same thing in our area and many other States as 
well too. I have actually had people ask me to ask this 
question or at least make a statement on it that there are 
labor shortages and people are pretty desperate with these 
seasonal operators along the coastal States and then probably 
some within as well. That is one thing.
    The other thing: I am not sure if you are aware or not, but 
the Customs and Border Patrol uniforms and others in the 
Department of Homeland Security are actually manufactured in El 
Salvador and Honduras, which is incredible to me, obviously, in 
facilities with limited security potentially. But we want to 
see those productions here for U.S. workers and that textile 
industry, obviously, to benefit us and then for national 
security as well.
    One other thing, one quick question for you: Commercial 
off-the-shelf technology, do you face acquisition hurdles in 
being able to get commercial off-the-shelf technology that best 
benefits you?
    Secretary Kelly. I haven't to date. I mean, certainly, my 
direction to the Department right now is, before we embark on 
any science projects to invent some new technology, let's look 
on the shelf first. But so long as we need it, we have the 
money, and the acquisition process is adhered to, to the best 
of my knowledge, we are not having any problem acquiring things 
off the shelf.
                  CYBER SECURITY: INFORMATION SHARING
    Mr. Taylor. One other quick thing now that I have you here, 
Mr. Secretary: On the cyber, I know that your command center--
and excellent work, obviously, protecting our homeland. Quick 
question on that: Are you sharing between agencies and outside 
of DHS's world to establish patterns for potential attribution 
to where those attacks are coming from and then best practices? 
Is that something that is actively happening? Are we sharing 
between agencies?
    Secretary Kelly. It is virtually automatic.
    Mr. Taylor. It is automatic.
    Mr. Carter [presiding]. I am going to cut it off right 
there. We have got to go.
    Mr. Taylor. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Carter. We stretched it way beyond the limit.
    Secretary Kelly. I am kind of glad you have to go vote.
    Mr. Carter. They are calling for us.
    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being there. Thank you for 
doing this job. Thank you for being here with us. Sorry we had 
to rush, but we have got to go.
    We are adjourned.
