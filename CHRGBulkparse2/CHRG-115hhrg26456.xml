    &lt;option&gt;              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
    Mr. Shimkus. I would like to call the hearing to order.
    And I want to thank our witnesses for joining us today.
    First of all, I know it is early. The one thing that is 
certain about us in Washington, D.C., is that there is 
uncertainty around us. So because of other meetings scheduled 
and planned, we asked for you to come early. And I do 
personally appreciate it. And it shows you the interest of our 
colleagues that they are here this early, so that is great.
    No matter how many miles you travel--first of all, we have 
got folks from as far away as Alaska and as close as 
Pennsylvania here. No matter how many miles you have traveled 
to be with us, we are grateful for the time and financial 
sacrifice you are making to share your expertise with us today.
    I also want to mention that even though they did not send 
someone to present oral testimony, I appreciate the 
Environmental Protection Agency providing us with a written 
statement to include in our hearing record. I ask for unanimous 
consent.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Shimkus. And I am also pleased to announce that the 
Agency has agreed to take written questions from members for 
our hearing record. This is highly unusual but an essential 
step to making this hearing record as complete as possible. And 
we obviously consider the Agency an important player whose 
technical experience and input is critical to the quality of 
our work.
    I now recognize myself 5 minutes for giving an opening 
statement.
    Today, our panel continues its look broadly at our Nation's 
drinking water infrastructure structure and examine questions 
as to what is necessary for the Federal Government to do in the 
way of planning, reinvestment, and technical support of these 
systems to meet future needs.
    The discussion draft which is subject to the hearing is 
meant to build on the testimony from our last hearing to help 
our subcommittee think more precisely about what items should 
be prioritized for legislation and how they should be addressed 
in the legislation.
    Importantly, the discussion draft is not a finite universe 
of all the issues that the committee is open to considering. It 
is a true baseline for conversation and an invitation for 
feedback or refinements or suggested alternative approaches and 
an opportunity to make the case for including additional 
issues.
    I know that some of us here today are curious why one 
provision or another is not added. I hope we can talk about 
those things today. I suspect we might be able to find 
agreement on some of those issues after we have had some time 
to find out each other's objectives and reflect on the best way 
to balance the needs of water, consumers, providers, and 
program implementers.
    Let me take a minute to explain some items in the 
discussion draft, why they are there.
    Based on oral testimony and written responses for the 
record, the water utility groups that testified at the last 
hearing talked about the importance of partnerships for 
addressing growth and compliance issues. The discussion draft 
proposes language to allow contractual arrangements or 
management of engineering services that will get a water system 
into compliance.
    Under questioning, many of the witnesses mentioned the 
important role that asset management can play in addressing 
short- and long-term water system needs but that mandating this 
requirement would be challenging. The discussion draft has 
states consider how to encourage best practices in asset 
management and has the EPA update technical and other training 
materials on asset management.
    We received testimony on the need to further aid 
disadvantaged communities. The discussion draft increases the 
amount a state can dedicate to disadvantaged communities to 35 
percent of their annual capitalization grant and permit states 
to extend loan payments for these communities by another 10 
years.
    We received testimony on the need to increase funding for 
the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund and the Public 
Water System Supervision grant, but not specific 
recommendations about what a realistic number is or whether 
commensurate budgetary cuts will offset these increases.
    In response to this, the discussion draft creates a 5-year 
authorization for appropriations of both these programs but 
leaves them blank to allow a greater and more specific 
conversation to occur. This will not be easy. Some of these 
conversations will be very difficult, but we will have to have 
them in an open and honest manner, but that is not new. Anyone 
who has been around our subcommittee for a while knows we have 
a reputation for tackling challenging issues.
    As I said earlier, we are at the beginning of this journey 
with a discussion draft as a baseline, and we are not close to 
the finish line as of yet.
    With that, I yield back my remaining time. And now I yield 
to my friend from New York, the ranking member, Mr. Tonko.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    The Subcommittee will now come to order.
    I want to thank our witnesses for joining us today, one 
from as far away as Alaska and the other as close as 
Pennsylvania. No matter how many miles you traveled to be with 
us, we are grateful for the time and financial sacrifice you 
are making to share your expertise with us today.
    I also want to mention that, even though they did not have

    I am also pleased to announce that the Agency has agreed to 
taken written questions from Members for our hearing record. 
This is a highly unusual, but essential step to making this 
hearing record as complete as possible and we, obviously, 
consider the Agency an important player whose technical 
experience and input is critical to the quality of our work.

    With that, I yield back my remaining time and now yield to 
my friend from New York, the Ranking Member of the 
Subcommittee, Mr. Tonko.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Chairman Shimkus. And thank you to 
our witnesses for being here on what is apparently a very busy 
morning in the House.
    We can all agree that aging drinking water systems can hold 
back economic growth and threaten public health. These problems 
will only get worse if we continue the decade's long trend of 
neglect. I know we have limited time, so I will not restate all 
the details of our growing national need to invest in drinking 
water systems and update the Safe Water Drinking Water Act. 
Suffice it to say, the need is immensely great. This 
subcommittee has been building a tremendous record that more 
than justifies the need for action.
    Mr. Chair, I appreciate you holding this hearing and 
offering the discussion draft to bring attention to our hidden 
infrastructure, which has been out of sight and, regrettably, 
out of mind for far too long.
    This draft responds to many of the issues that have been 
identified in previous hearings: the need to reauthorize the 
Drinking Water SRF and the Public Water System Supervision 
program; as well as the need to encourage asset management 
plans, greater source water protection, and support for 
disadvantaged communities.
    With that said, I truly believe we can improve upon the 
draft before us today which will ensure strong bipartisan 
support moving forward. There are a number of democratic bills 
that have already been introduced that can help inform these 
efforts. The AQUA Act includes provisions on how to further 
assist disadvantaged communities and better incentivize asset 
management plans. It would also help fulfill a stated goal of 
this administration mandating Buy America requirements.
    Mr. Pallone's SDWA amendments would enable EPA to 
promulgate much needed national standards. The bill also 
creates programs to reduce lead in schools among other 
important SDWA updates.
    Mr. Peters has a bill to provide grants to assist systems 
with resiliency, source water protection, and security in the 
face of changing hydraulic conditions, such as droughts, sea 
level rise, and other emerging pressures on systems.
    We do know the national need is growing: $384 billion over 
the next two decades to maintain current levels of services. We 
need to have the vision to acknowledge that this does not 
account for stresses, environmental and financial, that will 
continue to get worse if we simply do nothing.
    Finally, the Drinking Water SRF has been a tremendous 
success. I am grateful that Chair Shimkus has undertaken the 
first funding reauthorization since its inception in 1996. But 
as we will hear today, the draft includes unspecified funding 
levels.
    As a candidate, President Trump called for tripling funding 
for both SRF programs. The AQUA Act proposes levels that are in 
line with that--with what states handled following the Recovery 
Act. I think these are good targets to start negotiations.
    We must recognize that local governments are struggling. 
Significant amounts of projects go unfunded each year, and the 
status quo of Federal support will simply not reduce the 
massive and growing levels of need. It is time for the Federal 
Government to step up and contribute its fair share.
    Mr. Chair, I would end by asking for a commitment to sit 
down with our side, learn more about some of our proposals, and 
work together to make this a truly bipartisan effort that moves 
us forward. We had close cooperation on the brownfields 
reauthorization draft. I think we can get to a similar place on 
drinking water.
    And with that, I yield back.
    Mr. Shimkus. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman yields 
back.
    The chair now recognizes the Chairman of the Full 
Committee, Mr. Walden, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON
    Mr. Walden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    In March, our committee began a review of the financial 
needs of our entire Nation's drinking water infrastructure. We 
spoke about the need to think broadly about all things that can 
affect water affordability, reliability, and safety. Today, we 
take the next steps in our deliberative process by reviewing 
the discussion draft and related ideas from stakeholders to 
formulate policy on drinking water, state revolving loan 
funding, and Public Water System Supervision grants.
    We will also examine efforts to improve asset management by 
utilities and other ways to lift paperwork burdens and improve 
systems delivery of safe drinking water.
    Both sides of the aisle support making newer and larger 
investments in our Nation's infrastructure, and I agree that we 
need to help ensure these assets support the great quality of 
life Americans enjoy. However, in doing so, we must be careful 
to select wise investments and create diversified options that 
make sense for water systems, for states, and for consumers. It 
is important for us to tackle this job seriously for a couple 
of reasons.
    As we learned at the last hearing, the country's drinking 
water delivery systems are facing the challenges of older age. 
We learned from the water utilities and other stakeholders the 
importance of partnerships for addressing growth and compliance 
issues.
    The discussion draft proposes language to allow contractual 
arrangements for management and engineering services that will 
get a water system into compliance. We welcome feedback on that 
approach.
    We also received testimony on the need to increase funding 
for the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund and Public 
Water System Supervision grants, but not specific 
recommendations about what a realistic number is or whether 
budgetary cuts will offset these increases.
    For the last couple of years, the appropriated levels have 
been consistent. The appropriations for the Drinking Water 
Revolving Loan Fund were last authorized in 2003. That is long 
enough. It is time to reassert this committee's proper role in 
authorizing our statutes and realign the focus of the EPA and 
other agencies back to their core missions, in this case, 
ensuring the provision of safe drinking water for our Nation's 
consumers.
    We look forward to continuing the dialogue on this as our 
committee process continues.
    I want to welcome all of you here today, our witnesses, who 
took time and traveled from far and wide to be with us to 
comment on this discussion draft, and that is what it is. Your 
input is important, and we would appreciate specific 
recommendations as you are able to give on these important 
issues.
    And, again, thank you all for being here. We all care 
deeply about drinking water, safe drinking water, and helping 
our communities achieve that for all of our citizens in the 
country.
    And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my 
time.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    In March, our committee began a review of the financial

    I want to welcome all our witnesses who took time and 
traveled from far and wide to be with us to comment on the 
discussion draft. Your input is important, and we would 
appreciate as specific of recommendations as you are able to 
give on these important issues.
    Mr. Shimkus. The gentleman yields back the balance of his 
time.
    The chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of the Full 
Committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
    The safety of our drinking water is an incredibly important 
topic which deserves more time than we have at today's hearing.
    At our last drinking water hearing, we heard broad 
agreement from witnesses and members that we need to 
reauthorize the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and 
increase the funding. My democratic colleagues and I have been 
saying this for years, so I am encouraged that Republicans on 
this subcommittee now seem to agree.
    Unfortunately, this rushed hearing is not sufficient to 
address this issue. We have great ideas, but they are not 
reflected in the barebones discussion draft. We need a 
bipartisan effort to modernize the Safe Drinking Water Act, but 
in preparing this discussion draft, your staff didn't consult 
with us. We were eager to work with you, but we were told, 
without explanation, that such discussions could only happen 
after this hearing.
    So before us today is a discussion draft that, in my 
opinion, fails to measure up to the severity of the problem. It 
simply does not meet the needs of public water systems and the 
communities they serve. The draft contains nothing to address 
the growing problems of lead in drinking water in homes and 
schools. It does nothing to improve the regulatory process and 
better protect public health from new and emerging pollutant 
classes, and it does nothing to improve transparency and 
restore consumer confidence in the safety of our tap water, and 
there is no commitment to increase funding.
    So I am disappointed in the discussion draft, and I urge my 
colleagues to look at the real solutions in the bills that my 
democratic colleagues and I have introduced, and that is H.R. 
1071, the AQUA Act of 2017, and H.R. 1068, the Safe Drinking 
Water Act Amendments of 2017.
    I want to thank our witnesses for coming. I apologize that 
we don't have more time available, but I also want to express 
my frustration at the lack of a witness from the EPA. This 
subcommittee cannot produce meaningful legislation to 
reauthorize the state revolving fund and strengthen the Safe 
Drinking Water Act without their input. So it is clear we need 
to have another hearing.
    Safe drinking water is simply too important, and I hope we 
can start to work together on a bipartisan bill to tackle these 
serious problems.
    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Shimkus. The gentleman yields back his time.
    All members having concluded their opening statements, the 
chair would like to remind members that pursuant to the 
Committee rules, all members' opening statements will be made 
part of the record.
    I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here today 
and taking the time to testify before the subcommittee. Today's 
witnesses will have the opportunity to give opening statements, 
followed by a round of questions from members. Our witness 
panel for today's hearing are in front of us.
    What I will do is recognize you individually for 5 minutes. 
Your full statements are submitted for the record. And as you 
can see, there is a lot of interest from our side. So if you 
get too far over the 5 minutes, I might start tapping the gavel 
to get you to wind up.
    And before I take more time, let me just start by 
recognizing Mr. Martin Kropelnicki, President and CEO of the 
California Water Services Group, on behalf of the National 
Association of Water Companies. He testified here before. We 
are glad to have you back.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes.

&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Mr. Kropelnicki. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Good morning. I am Marty Kropelnicki, President and CEO of 
California Water Service Group, or Cal Water. We provide water 
and wastewater services to approximately 2 million people in 
the great State of California, Hawaii, New Mexico, and 
Washington, State of Washington. I am also the current 
President of National Association of Water Companies, which I 
am here representing today. NAWC's members have provided water 
and utility services for more than 200 years, and they serve 
approximately 25 percent of the U.S. population.
    NAWC applauds you, Mr. Chairman, and this subcommittee for 
highlighting America's drinking water infrastructure needs and 
putting forward a discussion draft amendment to the Safe 
Drinking Water Act for utilities and regulators to review.
    We are all working together toward the same outcome: safe, 
reliable, sustainable high-quality drinking water, which is 
critical to every person, every community, and every business 
in this country.
    Suffice it to say that substantial portions of the utility 
sector face significant challenges. The Nation's drinking water 
infrastructure recently received a D by the American Society of 
Civil Engineers. The American Water Works Association projects 
that $1 trillion will be needed to invest infrastructure 
through 2035 to replace aging infrastructure to keep up with 
population growth.
    More ominously, recent reports by the Natural Resources 
Defense Council showed that nearly one in four Americans get 
drinking water from untested and contaminated systems.
    With great challenges come great opportunities, and that is 
what we are here to talk about today. The discussion draft put 
forward by the subcommittee is a good first step to addressing 
the crisis. Legislation along these lines would do much to 
build upon and advance the good work of many water suppliers 
that are already undertaken.
    For example, NAWC estimates that our six largest members, 
of which Cal Water is one, will invest in nearly $2.7 billion 
this year alone in their water systems to ensure that they 
remain safe, reliable, and are sustainable for decades to come.
    Federal funds alone will not fix this problem, especially 
given that many of the problems are the results of poor 
decisionmaking year after year after year and not necessarily 
the absence of funding.
    Let me highlight for you several recommendations for 
Congress to consider. First, we must ensure that any Federal 
funds are used efficiently and effectively. NAWC and its 
members support the EPA's 10 attributes of effective utility 
management, which includes things such as financial viability 
and infrastructure stability.
    Applicants for dollars of public funds should demonstrate 
that there are management assets that adequate repair, 
rehabilitation, and replacement are fully reflected in 
management decisions, including water rates that reflect the 
true and full cost of service.
    Second, failing systems that are in seriously noncompliant 
situations with water quality standards must be held 
accountable. If a system is plagued with a history of serious 
noncompliance, it should be given an option to pursue a 
partnership that will lead to compliance or be compelled to 
consolidate system with an able owner or operator.
    Finally, as Congress considers future funding for drinking 
water programs, NAWC recommends that the private water sector 
not only have equal access to Federal funding but also that 
steps be taken to further enable and incentivize private water 
investment and involvement in solving the Nation's 
infrastructure challenges.
    Apart from the more obvious tax-based measures, these 
incentives should include providing a safe harbor or a shield 
that would allow companies like Cal Water or NAWC members to 
partner with undercompliant systems and give them that ramp-up 
time to be coming into compliance.
    Quite simply, private water companies like Cal Water and 
NAWC members have the financial balance sheets, managerial and 
technical expertise to help ensure that all Americans have 
safe, reliable, and sustainable high-quality drinking water.
    I sincerely appreciate the invitation to come back here 
today to testify. Along with my colleagues at NAWC, we look 
forward to continuing our work with you and this committee as 
we work on the Nation's infrastructure challenges.
    Thank you. And I would be happy to respond to any 
questions, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/option&gt;

    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you. The gentleman yields back his time.
    The chair now recognizes Mr. Scott Potter, Director of the 
Nashville Metro Water Services in Nashville, Tennessee, on 
behalf of the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes, sir. Thank you.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Mr. Potter. Good morning, sir.
    Chairman Shimkus, Ranking Member Tonko, and members of the 
subcommittee, the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, 
or AMWA, appreciates the opportunity to offer our thoughts 
today on the Drinking Water System Improvement Act of 2017.
    I am Scott Potter, Director of Metro Water Services in 
Nashville, Tennessee. We provide drinking water services to 
190,000 households and 200,000 sewer accounts in Nashville and 
Davidson County in Tennessee. I also serve as President of 
AMWA's Board of Directors. AMWA is an organization representing 
the Nation's largest publicly owned drinking water utilities, 
which collectively serve over 130 million Americans with 
quality drinking water. Our members support reauthorization of 
the Drinking Water SRF, and we appreciate that the legislation 
before the subcommittee today would do so for the first time in 
the program's history.
    My written testimony has been submitted for the record. It 
includes more detailed feedback on the various sections of the 
legislation, so I will use my time today to speak more 
generally about the bill and AMWA's priorities for 
reauthorization of the Drinking Water SRF.
    Simply put, we believe that the Drinking Water SRF is a 
valuable program. It should remain a cornerstone of Federal 
efforts to promote cost-effective water infrastructure 
financing to help communities protect public health and meet 
the regulatory requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act.
    We are pleased the Drinking Water System Improvement Act 
preserves the existing framework of the Drinking Water SRF, 
while making several targeted modernizations to the program and 
the Safe Drinking Water Act as a whole.
    For example, the bill will leverage the expertise of large 
water utilities by encouraging them to enter into agreements to 
help in-need water systems correct, identify water quality 
violations, and carry out necessary management and 
administrative functions.
    The bill also recognizes the importance of asset management 
by directing states to describe steps they will take to promote 
the adoption of effective asset management principles, 
practices, and how they will assist local utilities in training 
their staff to implement asset management plans.
    We support these measures, though AMWA also believes 
utilities that have completed qualifying asset management plans 
should be rewarded with a degree of additional preference when 
they apply for Drinking Water SRF assistance.
    The idea is not to make asset management plans mandatory or 
to exclude systems without asset management plans from 
receiving funding, but instead to incentivize all public water 
systems that seek SRF dollars to think holistically about the 
full life-cycle costs of their infrastructure.
    As this legislation continues to develop, AMWA would like 
to recommend several additional points for consideration. 
Perhaps most importantly, the final bill should reauthorize the 
Drinking Water SRF at a level that recognizes the immense 
nationwide water infrastructure need and does not inadvertently 
constrain Congress' ability to fund the Drinking Water SRF at 
an amount that appropriately responds to these needs.
    For example, initial versions of the fiscal year 2017 EPA 
appropriations bill approved by the House and Senate committees 
last year would have provided more than $1 billion for the 
Drinking Water SRF. Given the Nation's infrastructure needs and 
the apparent willingness of appropriators to provide this level 
of investment in the program, this legislation should authorize 
the funding level comfortably in excess of this figure.
    Earlier this year, AMWA and other water sector stakeholders 
endorsed a call to double Drinking Water SRF funding to roughly 
$1.8 billion. So a figure in this vicinity would serve as a 
reasonable starting point for the new authorization level.
    AMWA also supports expanding the Safe Drinking Water Act's 
definition of a disadvantaged community eligible for additional 
assistance to include a portion of the utility service area. 
The statute currently requires all the utility service area to 
meet the state's affordability criteria, but this is difficult 
to achieve for large metropolitan water systems that typically 
serve diverse populations that both have areas of affluence and 
also areas with concentrations of people in need.
    By allowing defined portions of a large utility service 
area to be classified as disadvantaged, more individual in-need 
neighborhoods served by America's large water providers would 
become eligible for the same type of benefits that are already 
available to many small cities and towns throughout the 
country.
    Finally, we support codifying the ability of recipients to 
use Drinking Water SRF funds for projects to improve the 
security of a public water system.
    In 2014, Congress explicitly allowed the use of clean water 
SRF funds for security improvement projects at publicly owned 
treatment works. So we believe it is appropriate to formally 
extend the same ability to public water systems.
    In closing, AMWA believes this legislation is a good 
starting point for efforts to reauthorize the Drinking Water 
SRF. We look forward to continuing to work with members of the 
subcommittee on this legislation, and I will be happy to answer 
any questions the committee may have.
    Thank you, sir.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    Mr. Shimkus. The gentleman yields back his time. The chair 
thanks him.
    And now I would like to recognize Mr. Steve Fletcher, 
Manager of the Washington County Water Company, Nashville, 
Illinois, in the great State of Illinois, and in the great 
district of the 15th Congressional District of Illinois, on 
behalf of--who represents that? I don't know--of the National 
Rural Water Association. You guys got me off my game.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Mr. Fletcher. Good morning, Chairman Shimkus, Ranking 
Member Tonko, and members of the subcommittee. I am Steve 
Fletcher from rural Illinois in Washington County.
    Rural Illinois and New York and the rest of America thank 
you for this opportunity to testify on drinking water 
infrastructure. Thank you, Congressmen Shimkus and Tonko, for 
your visits to your local small communities in your districts 
to tour and help with specific community water issues. This is 
very much appreciated.
    I also need to thank Congressmen Harper, Tonko, and the 
subcommittee for passing the Grassroots Rural and Small 
Community Technical Assistance Act into law in the last 
Congress.
    I am representing all small and rural community water 
supplies today through my association with the Illinois and 
National Rural Water Association.
    Our member communities have the responsibility of supplying 
the public with safe drinking water and sanitation every second 
of every day. Most all water supplies in the U.S. are small. 
Ninety-two percent of the country's 50,366 drinking water 
supplies serve communities with fewer than 10,000 persons. 
Illinois has 1,749 community water systems and 1,434 serve less 
than 10,000 people. New York has 2,343, and 2,195 of those 
serve communities with less than 10,000 people.
    My water system is a not-for-profit rural water system 
started by a group of farmers in the late 1980s who organized 
and built the water system using funding from the Federal 
Government that allowed these mainly farm families to receive 
safe, piped drinking water for the first time. Without the 
financial help from the Federal Government, we could never have 
afforded to have safe public water or even a public water 
utility.
    Before the development of the rural water systems, rural 
households, including mine, relied on cisterns and private 
wells that were contaminated with nitrate so we couldn't drink 
the water.
    We are pleased to endorse the subcommittee's legislation of 
the Drinking Water System Improvement Act of 2017. Small and 
rural communities support the use of these existing Federal 
infrastructure initiatives like the SRFs as the primary 
delivery mechanisms for any new Federal water infrastructure 
initiative. These initiatives all have specific provisions 
targeting Federal water subsidies to community water projects 
based on environmental and economic need. If some type of 
needs-based targeting is not specifically included in any new 
water infrastructure legislation, the funding will bypass rural 
America and be absorbed by large metropolitan water projects.
    This bill accomplishes this objective. We support the 
bill's extended maximum loan duration and increase in the 
amount of additional subsidization to disadvantaged 
communities. Commonly, low-income or disadvantaged communities 
do not have the ability to pay back the loan, even with very 
low interest rates, and require some portion of grant funding 
to make the project affordable to the rate payers.
    I would like to make two more related policy points with my 
remaining time. First, there is a misconception among some 
stakeholders that SRFs are for small and rural communities. 
SRFs have no limitation on size or scope of a water project. 
According to the EPA, most SRF funding is allocated to large 
communities. Approximately 62 percent of Drinking Water SRF 
funding is awarded to large communities, including numerous SRF 
projects that cost over $50 or $100 million. SRFs work for all 
sized water systems, and we are grateful for your support of 
the programs.
    My final point is regarding local governmental choice in 
decisions of consolidation and privatization. The decision for 
any local government to privatize or consolidate should be 
determined at the discretion of local citizens. There is 
nothing inherently more efficient or more economical in the 
operation of our private water utility versus the public 
governmental water utility.
    Regarding consolidation, rural water associations and 
systems like mine have assisted in more communities 
consolidating their water supplies than any program or 
organization. Again, when communities believe consolidation 
will benefit them, they eagerly agree with these partnerships. 
I have numerous examples from my own community which partners 
with six neighboring water utilities in various forms. We do 
not think any new Federal regulatory policy at expense of local 
government control and choice for privatization or 
consolidation would be beneficial to local communities or their 
citizens.
    Thanks, Mr. Shimkus, for being such a good friend in 
support of rural America and to give us this opportunity today. 
I am happy to answer any questions.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    Mr. Shimkus. The gentleman yields back his time, and the 
chair thanks him.
    And now I would like to turn to Ms. Lisa Daniels, director 
of the Bureau of Safe Drinking Water at the Pennsylvania 
Department of Environmental Protection, on behalf of the 
Association of State Drinking Water Administrators.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Ms. Daniels. Good morning, Chairman Shimkus, Ranking Member 
Tonko, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to be here to discuss the status of our Nation's 
state drinking water programs.
    I am also President-Elect for ASDWA, so I am very glad to 
be here to represent the organization.
    Our members are on the front lines every day ensuring safe 
drinking water and protecting public health. Vibrant and 
sustainable communities, their citizens, and businesses, all 
depend on a safe and adequate supply of drinking water.
    States oversee more than 152,000 public water systems and 
interact with them through a broad range of activities that are 
funded through two Federal funding sources. Of course, there is 
the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund, but there is also 
the Public Water System Supervision program.
    The vast majority of community water systems are in 
compliance with health-based standards. That is the good news. 
But what about those systems that struggle?
    The Drinking Water SRF can provide solutions for struggling 
systems. At only 20 years old, it really is a remarkable 
success story. It has allowed states to fund projects to 
upgrade treatment plants, rehabilitate distribution systems, 
address our aging infrastructure, and it has been quite 
successful. In fact, states have been able to leverage Federal 
funding to fund more than 13,000 projects through the SRF.
    A major component of the 1996 amendments was new statutory 
language that allow states to undertake what we call proactive 
measures. Funded through the set-asides, proactive measures 
such as operator training, technical assistance, and source 
water protection offer support for water systems as they strive 
to enhance their performance.
    Water systems are encouraged to consider a range of 
options, including partnerships, which could be as simple as 
sharing a backhoe or as complex as merging with a neighboring 
system. And the set-aside funds are available to support many 
of these activities.
    I would like to share an example from my home state. The 
Stockton Water System was a very small 43-home community that 
was operating as an untreated, unfiltered, and unpermitted 
surface water system. We discovered this system in 2014 because 
of customer complaints.
    The water was found to contain E. Coli, giardia, and 
salmonella. Traditional strategies and enforcement weren't 
working in this community. They really needed a different kind 
of assistance. We employed several capability enhancement 
programs in Stockton, including Capability Enhancement program, 
which provided the initial assessment and also provided onsite 
technical assistance to really help folks understand the 
challenges with this community. We also employed the 
professional engineering services program, which was able to 
conduct feasibility studies and design work to find the best 
solutions.
    These initiatives came together with PENNVEST, which is our 
SRF funding agency, to identify a willing partner. And we found 
that in the nearby Hazelton City Authority system. They agreed 
to work with Stockton, make the Drinking Water SRF application, 
extend water service, replace Stockton's existing distribution 
system, while keeping water rates at an affordable $35 per 
month. The total project cost was $2.2 million, which was 
underwritten by PENNVEST and, today, Stockton now has a safe 
and reliable supply of drinking water.
    Solutions such as this would absolutely not be possible 
without the Drinking Water SRF and the set-asides. Drinking 
water systems and the communities they serve are the direct 
beneficiaries of the work accomplished through these programs.
    State drinking water programs have often been expected to 
do more with less, and we have always responded with commitment 
and integrity, but we are currently stretched to the breaking 
point. Insufficient Federal funds increase the likelihood of 
contamination incidents, and we do not want to see another 
Charleston, West Virginia; Toledo, Ohio; or Flint, Michigan.
    To sustain public health protection, states need 
congressional support. For the past 4 years, the PWSS program 
has flat funded, and the Drinking Water SRF funding has 
decreased. These essential programs come with well-documented 
needs, and they must be fully supported.
    ASDWA recommends the PWSS program be funded at $200 
million, and we also recommend the Drinking Water SRF be funded 
at $1.2 billion to allow us to continue to do this great work.
    In summary, the 1996 amendments offered the community a 
promise of enhanced public health protection through a 
framework of both traditional and proactive collaboration 
between state drinking water programs and the water systems 
that they oversee. Maintaining funding for the Drinking Water 
SRF, the set-asides, and the PWSS program is critical.
    State drinking water programs are committed to fulfilling 
the promise of the 1996 amendments. Thank you.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    Mr. Shimkus. I thank the lady.
    The chair now recognizes Mr. Kurt Vause, who gets the 
longest traveling award for getting here, Special Projects 
Director at Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility, on behalf 
of the American Water Works Association.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes. Welcome.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Mr. Vause. Good morning, Chairman Shimkus, and members of 
the subcommittee. My name is Kurt Vause. I am the Special 
Projects Director for the Anchorage Water and Wastewater 
Utility from Anchorage, Alaska. I also serve as the Chair of 
the Water Utility Council and Acting Chair of the Asset 
Management Committee of the American Water Works Association.
    We deeply appreciate this opportunity to offer the 
viewpoints and experiences of drinking water providers to the 
important deliberations and decisions of this committee.
    The discussion draft of drinking water legislation this 
subcommittee is considering is a good step towards addressing 
the Nation's needs, to reinvest in its water infrastructure, 
and towards addressing other needs as well. I would like to 
briefly address three topics.
    First, providing safe drinking water to communities 
requires a complex mix of engineering, capital investment, 
management, science, community engagement, and regulatory 
resources. This complexity makes it particularly difficult for 
many small systems to remain in compliance in regulation and 
maintain their infrastructure.
    Options to help address these challenges include 
partnerships or regionalization to share resources among these 
systems, many who serve small systems and communities. 
Regionalization or partnerships encompass anything from 
physical connections to shared management, engineering, 
operations, and purchasing resources.
    When a compliant utility absorbs or merges a noncompliant 
utility, that newly formed utility faces a regulatory 
compliance challenge. The SDWA ought to provide a finite grace 
period for the newly merged system to come into compliance with 
regulation. Whether a utility has explored consolidation should 
become one of the factors weighted in ranking SRF loans or in 
evaluating compliance options.
    Second, all utilities manage their assets, but the practice 
we now formally call asset management is more scientific and 
focused. The goal of infrastructure asset management is to meet 
a required level of service in the most cost-effective manner 
at an acceptable level of risk through the management of assets 
for present and future customers.
    We do not believe a specific level of asset management 
practice should be mandated, because that would put Congress or 
a regulatory agency in the business of defining asset 
management objectives. Utilities vary too greatly in strategic 
objectives, size, type of assets, geography, climate, source 
waters, type of treatment and distribution for a Federal 
definition to be practical.
    Professional organizations such as AWWA are making 
education and asset management practice an ongoing part of our 
educational efforts for members. For example, AWWA's upcoming 
annual conference. Our Asset Management Committee has developed 
a track of sessions on project infrastructure and asset 
management with five individual sessions containing 27 separate 
presentations.
    We also believe there is a role States can play in similar 
efforts through the maintenance of the PWSS supervision grants. 
We urge Congress to maintain PWSS funding for fiscal year 2018 
at no less the current authorization levels.
    Third, as we have said before to Congress, local rates and 
charges have been and will likely always be the backbone of 
local water system finance. However, when major infrastructure 
projects require either to comply with regulations or replace 
aging infrastructure, there is a need for a quicker, larger 
infusion of cash than those rates and charges typically 
provide.
    This is where the toolbox of utility finance comes into 
play. This spring, AWWA cosigned a two-page summary of how the 
Federal Government can assist water utilities in financing 
these challenges. The highlights of that were: Number one, 
preserve the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds; two, provide 
fully authorized funding for the Water Infrastructure Finance 
and Innovation Act, known as WIFIA, at $45 million for fiscal 
year 2018; three, double appropriations for the drinking water 
and wastewater SRF programs; and four, remove the annual volume 
caps on private activity bonds for water infrastructure 
projects.
    We realize appropriations come from the Appropriations 
Committees, but we seek your support in funding with these 
panels.
    This concludes my remarks to the subcommittee. We also look 
forward to continuing dialogue with this panel after this 
hearing.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    Mr. Shimkus. The chair thanks the gentleman.
    The chair now recognizes Ms. Lynn Thorp, National Campaigns 
Director at Clean Water Action.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Ms. Thorp. Thank you.
    Good morning, Chairman Shimkus, Ranking Member Tonko, and 
members of the subcommittee. My name is Lynn Thorp. I am 
National Campaigns Director at Clean Water Action. We are a 
national organization with 1 million members working in 15 
states on health and environmental projects with an emphasis on 
drinking water issues.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the 
Drinking Water System Improvement Act. Recent high profile 
events have highlighted the importance of infrastructure 
investment, effective system operation, and source water 
protection. From the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, 
to the leaking chemical storage tank that contaminated the Elk 
River in West Virginia, we have seen how taking drinking water 
for granted can lead to public health risks and economic 
disruption of entire communities.
    Our approach to meeting 21st century drinking water 
challenges needs to be a holistic one. It should include not 
only increased investment in infrastructure, but also 
sufficient resources for effective oversight of Safe Drinking 
Water Act compliance by Federal and state primacy partners, 
more funding for research and innovation, more attention to 
keeping drinking water sources clean, and a vision for how we 
want our drinking water systems to look in the second half of 
the 21st century.
    You can see some ideas about that in the testimony from the 
witnesses we have heard from already this morning and in the 
2016 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Drinking Water Action 
Plan.
    We do hope this subcommittee will consider provisions in 
the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 2017, H.R. 1068, 
introduced by Representatives Tonko and Pallone earlier this 
year. Transparency, how we determine which contaminates to 
regulate, climate resiliency and drought, threats to drinking 
water from oil and gas and other activities, water efficiency, 
and technology innovation are all important if we are to 
maintain a high quality of drinking water and healthy water 
systems.
    We support Drinking Water State Revolving Fund 
authorizations commensurate with those proposed in the AQUA Act 
mentioned earlier today, which would authorize over $3 billion 
in fiscal year 2018, and increase thereafter reaching $5.5 
billion on fiscal year 2022.
    AWWA, the American Society of Civil Engineers, and EPA have 
repeatedly found investment needs orders of magnitude greater 
than those authorizations I have mentioned. Ambitious 
authorizations signal a commitment to clean drinking water and 
are a reasonable contribution to the mix of funding sources 
available to drinking water systems.
    We also support increased authorizations for Public Water 
Systems Supervision grants. The Association of State Drinking 
Water Administrators has estimated the gap in needs between 
current funding and comprehensive State programs to be $300 
million or more annually. As noted earlier, bridging this gap 
will increase public health protection and support sustainable 
drinking water systems.
    Drinking Water State Revolving Fund dollars can be spent on 
numerous activities that support those goals: pipe replacement, 
treatment upgrades, source water protection, improvements for 
storage, and system restructuring and consolidation. We want to 
highlight just two of those here as examples: pipe repair and 
replacement and source water protection.
    As you know, EPA estimates we may have between some 6 1A\1/
2\ or even more than 10 million lead service lines or partial 
lead service lines in the United States. Lead is a highly 
poisonous metal, and children under 6 are most at risk. 
Increased investment can help more communities move sooner to 
full lead service line replacement.
    American Society of Civil Engineers also estimates there 
are over 240,000 water main breaks each year due to 
deteriorating and poorly maintained pipes. As you probably 
know, just this week, a pipe from 1860, a water main broke 
right in Northwest, D.C. We lose water through leaks in mains 
and service lines as well, and these disruptions threaten 
public health, allowing pathogens to get into the pipes and, of 
course, lead to loss of treated water. Some estimates say up to 
18 percent of treated water, which is a valuable commodity, if 
you will.
    So shoring up our underground drinking water infrastructure 
not only protects public health, reduces lost revenue for 
drinking water systems, but also leads to less disruption, like 
we saw in parts of D.C. just this week.
    We can also use Drinking Water State Revolving Funds for 
source water protection, and many communities are using 
innovative strategies in this area. The return on investment 
there is clear in terms of public health protection. And the 
EPA estimates that every dollar spent on protecting a drinking 
water source saves $27 in drinking water treatment.
    I just want to close by noting that EPA programs are 
fundamental to the success of state programs and water systems. 
So increased state revolving fund investment won't be as 
effective if at the same time EPA lacks staffing and funding 
for oversight, enforcement, research, development of 
contaminant standards, support for small systems, and other 
critical activities.
    We urge subcommittee members to oppose cuts in EPA funding 
as well as rollbacks of health and environmental protections 
that would put our Nation's drinking water sources at risk of 
contamination.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you.
    The chair now recognizes Mr. James Proctor, Senior Vice 
President and General Counsel at McWane, Inc.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;    Mr. Proctor. Chairman Shimkus, Ranking Member Tonko, 
Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, members of the 
subcommittee, good morning. I am Jim Proctor from McWane in 
Birmingham, Alabama, and I greatly appreciate the opportunity 
to be here this morning to testify about an issue that is so 
vital to our Nation's health, economy, and security.
    For almost 200 years, McWane has proudly provided the 
building blocks for our Nation's water infrastructure, 
supplying the pipes, valves, fittings, and related products 
that transport clean water to communities and homes across the 
country. We employ more than 6,000 team members who work in 14 
States and 9 other countries. Most of those team members are 
represented by the United Steelworkers and other labor 
organizations who we consider as partners in our efforts to 
improve our economy and our communities.
    I am pleased that the Committee is considering efforts to 
modernize the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. The Drinking 
Water SRF has played a key role in delivering the investment 
efficiently to communities throughout the Nation. However, as 
the Committee has recognized, it needs reform to make it more 
responsive to the scale of America's water infrastructure 
needs.
    A vital component of any drinking water SRF improvement is 
a significant and consistent annual authorization level to spur 
increased capital investment. This investment will create and 
preserve the highways jobs that make these products and allow 
producers to harness the economies of scale that make American 
products more competitive. These impacts have a multiplier 
effect as they ripple through supply chains.
    We also need to invest those dollars wisely. Like 
generations before us, we should rebuild our infrastructure 
with the most durable energy efficient and safe materials 
available. And smart technology offers many innovative 
solutions that can improve system management and reduce cost to 
cash-strapped utilities. But increased funding and better 
management do American workers and industry little good if 
their tax dollars are spent on unfairly traded foreign imports.
    Like many other American manufacturers, we have made huge 
investments to modernize our operations to exceed the world's 
most rigorous environmental safety and regulatory standards. 
But we must compete every day against foreign state-owned or 
state-subsidized foundries that do not operate by any 
comparable regulatory standards and have little regard for 
workplace safety or the environment. This creates significant 
competitive disadvantages and have led to lost sales, closed 
plants, and lost jobs. And as the factories that once built our 
Nation's infrastructure disappear, communities lose the vital 
tax revenues and rate payers needed to operate and maintain 
their water systems.
    Put simply, we can't continue to divorce Federal regulatory 
policies from procurement policies. The same Federal Government 
that regulates our operations and taxes our workers should use 
their tax dollars to purchase domestic products for the 
Nation's infrastructure, particularly when foreign alternatives 
are produced in conditions that would make members of this 
esteemed body cringe.
    Fortunately, this problem has been mitigated recently by 
the application of the American Iron and Steel Buy American 
preference to the SRFs and WIFIA programs. Buy America has 
created incentives to preserve increased production capacities 
in the United States and to maintain work forces critical to 
sustaining the communities around them. I can say with pride 
and relief that this Buy American preference has saved at least 
one of our plants and preserved hundreds of jobs in the 
economically depressed area.
    By 2008, our waterworks fittings plant in Anniston, 
Alabama, was the last surviving domestic manufacturer of these 
products. At one time, there were as many as a dozen such 
plants in the U.S., but all fell victim to the unfair 
competition I described previously. Even that lone survivor was 
at risk of closure during the Great Recession, operating at 
around 30 percent of its production capacity. But because of 
Buy American, that plant has increased its capacity utilization 
to almost 70 percent, added product offerings, and more than 
doubled the number of jobs. Our other plants have seen similar 
benefits.
    But the impacts aren't limited to our operations. Because 
of Buy America, the primary importer of waterworks fittings has 
brought its production back to the United States, recently 
purchasing a domestic production facility and restoring 
hundreds of American jobs, while increasing competition in the 
marketplace.
    In 2014, Congress codified the Buy American preference for 
the Clean Water SRF and WIFIA. Over that same time, it has been 
applied to the Drinking Water SRF through the annual 
appropriations process.
    Congress should align the Drinking Water SRF with the Clean 
Water SRF, WIFIA, and other Federal infrastructure programs, 
like transportation, of making the provision permanent. This 
will not only preserve jobs, but a consistent standard will 
increase administrative efficiency and reduce costs since many 
water projects tap into multiple federal funding sources.
    The reformation and reauthorization of the Safe Drinking 
Water Act programs with the Buy American preference are crucial 
to our Nation's health and prosperity. We at McWane are honored 
to have the opportunity to contribute to that process.
    Thank you very much.
