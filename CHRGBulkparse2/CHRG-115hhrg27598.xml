    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS, A REPRESENTATIVEIN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;United States of America is in the midst of a fierce battle 
against an epidemic brought to us by opioids. It does not 
matter where you live. This crisis has touched every corner of 
American society.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;While New England and the Ohio Valley regions represent 
States hardest hit by the epidemic, health officials from the 
South and reaching across the West all report a growing number 
of overdose deaths in those counties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;The latest figures from the Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention are astounding. Ninety-one Americans die every day 
from an overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;Now, more than ever, we must come together and strengthen 
our commitment to fight this malady. I expect today's Members 
Day will bring to the forefront key insights and potential 
solutions on this critical issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;In the previous Congress, the Energy and Commerce Committee 
led several bipartisan initiatives to help address the opioid 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;The Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act and the 21st 
Century Cures Act are now law and providing resources at the 
State and local levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;Much-needed policy changes are being implemented the 
passage of both CARA--with the passage of both CARA and Cures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;In fact, as a result of CARA, patients suffering from 
substance abuse now have greater access to evidence-based 
treatment, addiction treatment services, and overdose reversal 
therapies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;Cures, on the other hand, provided $1 billion in grants for 
States to support an array of prevention treatment and recovery 
services. I believe these initiatives are making a significant 
difference.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;At the same time, other issues have emerged in this fight. 
Earlier this year, our committee responded to reports of people 
overdosing on heroin laced with synthetic opioids--fentanyl, 
carfentanyl--which are 100 to 10,000 times more potent than 
morphine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;The ready availability of these synthetic opioids have 
become a public health threat and illegal online pharmacies, 
primary operating in foreign countries, are exacerbating this 
epidemic every day for our State and Federal officials.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;Today's hearing will allow us to gain Member perspective on 
potential ways to complement existing policies and Federal 
regulations to combat the opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;Representatives both on and off the Energy and Commerce 
Committee will testify about the opioid epidemic, share their 
stories, and propose legislative solutions for our 
consideration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;In advance, I want to thank House Members for participating 
in this important discussion, and we look forward to hearing 
from everyone who's going to be before us today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS"&gt;    Let me yield what little time I have left to the vice 
chairman of the Health Subcommittee, Mr. Guthrie.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Guthrie&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt;Thank you very much. Obviously, I am going to
be brief.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt;So many families have been devastated by this, and in 
``Dreamland,'' which is a book that I read about the opioid 
crisis--an important book that I read about the opioid crisis--
had all these different scenarios.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt;But when you see it in reality, I was in Owensboro one 
evening and met a mom. The mom was the mother of an athletic 
student--an athlete and an honor student--who had her ACL torn 
playing soccer, was prescribed painkillers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt;After her recovery she was addicted to pain killers. Since 
she couldn't have access to them, turned to heroin, and passed 
away due to an overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt;This is a sad story that is repeated through all groups and 
all areas and it's something that I am looking forward to 
hearing all the testimony today to look for ideas to further do 
what Congress has done through CARA and moving forward as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"&gt;    So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GENE GREEN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GENE GREEN"&gt; The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of
the subcommittee, Mr. Green, 3 minutes for an opening 
statement, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called 
for prescription drug overdose abuse in the United States an 
epidemic, has found drug overdose to be the leading cause of 
injury death in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Between 1999 and 2010, the death rate from prescription 
painkillers more than quadrupled and only continues to rise. In 
2015, more than 52,000 people died of drug overdoses in America 
and about two-thirds of those were linked to opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;The toll is only rising. The New York Times' analysis of 
preliminary data found that 59,000 to 65,000 likely died from 
overdoses in 2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Today, it's estimated that more than 2 million have use 
disorder and too few of these people are in treatment. The rate 
of heroin overdoses had increased dramatically in recent years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Its rise is directly linked to the opioid epidemic. In 
2010, approximately 3,000 drug-poisoning deaths were connected 
to heroin. In 2013, the number jumped to a total of 8,000 
overdose deaths and only continues to rise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;There is no community that has not been touched by this 
crisis and some have been ravaged by it. This committee has 
taken steps to address the crisis but so much is needed to 
combat it when families and communities across the country are 
being torn apart.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Included in the 21st Century Cares, or the State-targeted 
response to the opioid crisis grant program, it provided a 
billion dollars over 2017 to 2018 to States to address the 
opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Extending this money is a crucial part of any continued 
Federal efforts to respond to the epidemic. We need an approach 
that employs proven health--public health strategies and spans 
the entire spectrum from prevention to treatment and recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;These include robust funding to support prevention, crisis 
response and expanded access to treatment and long--lifelong 
recovery tools.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;The Affordable Care Act is a vital part of our efforts to 
fight against the opioid epidemic. More than 1.5 million 
Americans with substance abuse use disorders have access to 
treatment through Medicaid that doesn't--that didn't before the 
ACA, thanks to the Medicaid expansion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Unfortunately, Americans fighting addiction that live in 
States that refuse to expand their Medicaid programs like Texas 
were left out in the cold.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;For those in the individual market, all plans must include 
services for substance abuse disorders and mental health, and 
consumers cannot be denied coverage because of a history of 
substance abuse, all thanks to the ACA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;This is not a small feat. Prior to the ACA, roughly a third 
of all individual market policies didn't cover substance abuse 
treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Repealing the mental substance abuse disorder coverage 
provision of the ACA will remove at least $5.5 billion annually 
from the treatment of low-income people with mental and 
substance abuse disorders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Going even further is to gut the traditional Medicaid or 
scrap the Medicaid expansion in States that took the money 
would be absolutely devastating to our fight against 
prescription drug and heroin addiction crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;We are in the midst of the largest public health crisis 
that our country has known and this is not time to cut health 
care safety nets that serve those in recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;I am pleased that we have the opportunity to hear from our 
colleagues about their proposals and to combat the prescription 
drug epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;We need a comprehensive solution to the crisis that 
includes real dollars and targets the entire spectrum of 
addiction, prevention, crisis response for those who fall 
through the cracks, and expanding access to treatment and 
proving support for recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;We must be guided by science and avoid stigmas and not fall 
into traps, misconceptions about proven treatment strategies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;I thank the chairman for having this conversation and look 
forward to advancing new strategies and funding to turn the 
side of this growing crisis and really help families and 
communities that desperately need it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;    And I yield back my time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Gentleman yields back. The Chair thanks the
gentleman. I will just make an organizational note before we 
move to our first panel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;We are going to be hearing from Energy and Commerce members 
at the outset. Energy and Commerce members are welcome to give 
their testimony from the witness table or from the dais, 
whichever they prefer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;We are going to move to our first panel, which will consist 
of Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman Upton, Ms. 
Eshoo, and Chairman Latta, and again, you are welcome to 
testify either from the table or from the dais.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. GREG WALDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF OREGON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GREG WALDEN"&gt;    So, with that, the Chair recognizes the chairman of the 
full committee, Mr. Walden.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I thank the chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I come here today on behalf of my constituents like I do 
every day, but I think especially today, with our opportunity 
for all Members to make their case to the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, first we want to welcome them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And I think as our colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
have already said, all of us in all of our communities face 
these challenges related to drug overdoses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I held a round table the day before yesterday in Bend, 
Oregon, where I learned a lot about the problems they're facing 
and some of the successes they are having, and the importance 
of the work that we are doing here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;It is a heartbreaking epidemic that has been featured on 
the front pages of our local newspapers, on national 
television, as part of the stories from our friends and family 
members, and with good reason.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Conservative estimates forecast that more than 90 Americans 
die from opioid abuses overdoses each day--90 a day, Mr. 
Chairman, while more than a thousand are treated each day for 
abusing opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;In 2016 alone, more than 64,000 Americans died from drug 
overdoses and in Oregon alone, more people died last year from 
drug overdoses than from car accidents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I recently held round tables in southern and central Oregon 
to discuss how we can better combat this crisis. Meeting with 
the people on the front lines of this fight in our communities 
to find out what is working, what more can be done, is crucial 
to our efforts to end this scourge.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;The Energy and Commerce Committee has led a number of 
bipartisan initiatives to help address the opioid epidemic, 
from groundbreaking initiatives that are now law like the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--CARA--and the 21st 
Century Cures Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Resources are become available and important policy changes 
are being implemented to stem the tide of opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;CARA established a comprehensive strategy for improving 
evidence-based treatment for patients with substance abuse 
disorders and it made significant changes to expand access to 
addiction treatment and services and overdose reversal 
medications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;The new law also included criminal justice and law 
enforcement-related provisions. The 21st Century Cures Act 
provided a billion dollars in grants for States, the first half 
of which was made available in April of 2017 to be administered 
by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, or SAMHSA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;My State of Oregon received $6.5 million in grants to help 
combat the epidemic that has plagued our great State. However, 
so much more work needs to be done.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Since the passage of CARA and the 21st Century Cures Act, 
other issues have emerged in the fight against opioids such as 
the proliferation of fentanyl and its analogs, and then there 
are allegations of pill dumping and the practice of patient 
brokering.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;In my own district, I've heard the all-too-familiar tale of 
the mother whose oldest son was first prescribed opioids after 
injuring his ankle playing basketball. It didn't take long for 
him to become addicted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Another parent shared with me the story of his sister and 
nurse who died of an overdose after years of suffering from 
addiction and bounding between pharmacies, passing off forged 
prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;He spoke about how better tracking and treatment could have 
helped catch his sister's problem earlier and perhaps made 
counseling more effective.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;As it was, she was the--she was only caught because two 
pharmacies in the small town happen to check with each other. 
You see, by then it was too late, though.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;These two stories may have come from Oregon, but they're 
not exclusive to the Beaver State. They're why we are here 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Addressing the opioid epidemic requires an all hands on 
deck effort. Today we'll be hearing testimony and stories from 
our colleagues both on and off the Energy and Commerce 
Committee about what more can be done and I am looking forward 
to hearing feedback and input from both sides of the aisle to 
hear about what is working and what is not and find ways to 
complement our existing law and to address emerging issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;So with that, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate everyone here 
today with us, taking time to participate. I look forward to 
hearing from all my colleagues, and together we must continue 
to fight this opioid crisis in America, and I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;It's great to see so much activity in our hearing room 
today. While there are a lot of familiar faces, there are 
plenty that we don't see in here on a regular basis. For those 
folks, I'd like to say welcome to Energy and Commerce. I'm glad 
you could join us for this important opportunity to highlight 
the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;The heartbreaking epidemic has been featured on the front

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR., A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. FRANK PALLONE"&gt;    So at this time I will recognize the ranking member of the 
full committee, Frank Pallone from New Jersey, for 5 minutes, 
please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Today's Member Day provides us the opportunity to hear from 
our colleagues about how the epidemic is uniquely affecting 
their districts as well as to hear their ideas of additional 
efforts and funding that is needed to help individuals, 
families, and communities affected by this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Like all communities across the country, the opioid 
epidemic is having devastating consequences in my home State. 
Drug overdoses are the leading causes of accidental death in 
New Jersey.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, there were--there was a 16 percent increase in drug 
overdose deaths in New Jersey between 2014 and 2015, and last 
year drug overdose deaths topped more than 2,000.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And unfortunately, we are continuing to see increased 
deaths from this tragic epidemic. I am proud of the steps this 
committee has taken to respond to this tragic epidemic that is 
taking the lives of 91 Americans every day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I am pleased that we worked together in a bipartisan 
fashion to pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, 
or CARA. We also worked together to create the State-targeted 
response to the opioid crisis grant program as part of the 21st 
Century Cures Act and this grant program provides a billion to 
States to address the opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;There were positive and--well, these were positive and 
bipartisan laws that we produced in 2016 during the last year 
of the Obama administration. That was 2016. Two thousand 
seventeen has been much different.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Congressional Republicans have spent much of this year 
trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would have 
prevented millions of Americans from getting the help that they 
need to treat opioid use disorders and the repeal legislation 
passed here in the House would have allowed insurers to once 
again discriminate against people with preexisting conditions 
such as opioid use disorders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;The Republican-passed bill would also have allowed States 
to waive essential health benefits including mental health and 
substance use treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;But, thankfully, those repeal efforts have failed to date. 
So as we move forward, what is clear is that individuals with 
substance use disorder, their families, and their communities 
need us to work together to do more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Despite some progress here in Washington, the epidemic has 
shown no signs of relenting and that is why we must continue to 
support and increase funding for proven health--public health 
approaches spanning the entire spectrum from crisis to 
recovery, including expanding access to medication-assisted 
treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Those efforts should include more funding and we should 
extend the State-targeting response to the opioid crisis grant 
program so that we can expand even further people's access to 
opioid abuse treatment, prevention, and recovery support 
services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So I look forward to hearing from my House colleagues and 
continuing to work together in a bipartisan fashion to help our 
country respond to this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

(CARA). We also worked together to create the State Targeted 
Response to the Opioid Crisis grant program as part of the 21st

States to address the opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;These were positive and bipartisan laws that we produced in 
2016 during the last year of the Obama administration. That was

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. FRED UPTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROMTHE STATE OF MICHIGAN&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. FRED UPTON"&gt;    Chair recognizes the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, 
Mr. Upton, for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Upton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;This is very important, this Member Day, as we are able to 
all share our personal experiences on a crisis that has been 
plaguing our Nation over the last couple of years--opioid 
addiction and abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;This silent epidemic has for sure torn through families, 
neighbourhoods, and communities, both certainly in my home 
State of Michigan. But we know across the country as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;In fact, in 2015, there were nearly 2,000 opioid abuse-
related deaths in Michigan alone. Even more tragically, more 
than 22,000 babies are born every year across the country with 
neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;This terrible epidemic has hit home both in my community 
and, yes, even in my extended family. So this is very personal 
to me as it is with so many throughout our communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;In the last couple of years, I have been meeting with first 
responders, crisis center employees, advocacy groups, and yes, 
individuals suffering.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;All of these folks have said that, tragically, the death 
toll continues to rise. That is why we have been taking 
concrete steps here in this committee to combat the widespread 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;Just last year, the President signed into his sweeping 
package aimed at attacking the opioid epidemic from all sides.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;As part of 21st Century Cures, a bill that every one of our 
committee members supported, an additional $1 billion was 
allocated to the States like Michigan to address opioid 
addiction, treatment and prevention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;This year the first round of funding was delivered. We 
received $16 million and that grant funding will make a real 
difference. It will.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;To those suffering I just say help is on the way, and as a 
result of this legislation as well as administrative action, 
NIH Director Francis Collins is helping to lead the charge.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;This summer, the NIH started meeting with experts in 
academia and the biopharmaceutical industry to talk about 
innovative ways in which Government and industry can work 
together to address the crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;I strongly support that work and look forward to seeing the 
results of the research that NIH is doing with its industry 
partners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;There are also things that we in Congress can help NIH with 
in these endeavors. First, we need the NIH to develop more 
options for overdose reversals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;Second, we need the evidence that the NIH can develop an 
effective therapy for addiction, and finally, we must 
accelerate the development of nonaddictive pain medicines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;The sooner that we in Congress supply the resources 
necessary to conduct that work, the sooner that we can supply 
powerful new tools for every community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;These efforts can't happen fast enough and these are some 
of the many reasons that I continue to support robust NIH 
funding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Upton"&gt;There is more work to be done, and here in Congress we will 
continue to take steps to address that epidemic and in this 
committee we are on the front lines to advance meaningful 
bipartisan legislation that indeed will make a difference. 
Together, we will bring it out of the shadows.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Fred Upton&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Fred Upton"&gt;I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Fred Upton"&gt;Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this very important 
Member Day hearing on a crisis that has been plaguing our 
Nation over the last several years--opioid addiction and abuse, 
This silent epidemic has torn through families, neighborhoods, 
and communities both in my home State of Michigan and indeed 
across the entire country. In fact, in 2015, there were nearly 
2,000 opioid abuse related deaths in Michigan alone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Fred Upton"&gt;In the last few years I have been meeting with first 
responders, crisis center employees, advocacy groups, and yes--
individuals suffering. All of these folks have said that, 
tragically, the death toll continues to rise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Fred Upton"&gt;This is why we have been taking concrete action here in the 
Energy and Commerce Committee to combat this widespread 
epidemic. Just last year, the president signed into law a 
sweeping package aimed at attacking the opioid epidemic from 
all sides.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Fred Upton"&gt;As part of my landmark, bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act, 
an additional $1 billion was allocated to States, like 
Michigan, to address opioid addiction treatment and prevention. 
Just this year, the first round of that funding was delivered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Fred Upton"&gt;Michigan received more than $16 million. This grant funding 
will make a real difference. To those suffering, I just say 
this: Help is on the way.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Fred Upton"&gt;As a result of my legislation as well as administrative 
action, my good friend Dr. Francis Collins is helping to lead 
the charge in his position as director of the National 
Institutes of Health. This summer, the NIH started meeting with 
experts in academia and the biopharmaceutical industry to talk 
about innovative ways in which Government and industry can work 
together to address this crisis. I strongly support this work 
and look forward to seeing the results of the research NIH is 
doing with its industry partners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Fred Upton"&gt;There are also things we in Congress can help NIH with in 
these endeavors. First, we need NIH to develop more options for 
overdose reversal. Second, we need the evidence NIH can develop 
on effective therapies for addiction. And finally, we must 
accelerate the development of nonaddictive pain medicines. The 
sooner we in Congress supply the resources necessary to conduct 
this work, the sooner we can supply powerful new tools for our 
communities. These efforts can't happen fast enough, and these 
are some of the many reasons that I continue to support robust 
NIH funding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Fred Upton"&gt;    There is more work to be done. Clearly. And here in 
Congress we will continue to take steps to address this 
epidemic. Here in this committee, we're on the front lines in 
advancing meaningful, bipartisan legislation that will make a 
difference. Together, we can take this ``silent epidemic'' and 
bring it out of the shadows.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. LEONARD LANCE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. LEONARD LANCE"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Lance, 
3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I must say this is
the first time I've been on this side of the dais and what a 
fine looking group.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt; It is more fun being over here, as you know.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;If it makes the gentleman more comfortable, we
can swear you in.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    [Laughter.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; That means I would be under oath.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess, for organizing this
conversation today. The opiate crisis is devastating families 
and communities across New Jersey, the State I represent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;In 2015, the Garden State's death rate was two and a half 
times the skyrocketing U.S. rate. We are making progress with 
the implementation of the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act 
of 2016, but more work needs to be done.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;I acknowledge the efforts of one of my constituents, 
Basking Ridge resident Clodette Sabatelle. Clodette has done 
critical work and has made a positive difference in the lives 
of those suffering from drug addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Her advocacy group, Community in Crisis, helps equip the 
loved ones of those in pain. None of the progress we have made 
so far in this fight against drug addiction and opiate abuse 
would have been possible without the work of people like 
Clodette and organizations like Community in Crisis. Their 
efforts are efforts that we should make sure Congress 
understands and applauds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;I worked closely with Clodette on the issue of over 
prescription. In 2012, health care providers wrote 259 million 
prescriptions for opiates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;The CARA provisions I authored addressed that issue by 
reforming and improving the medical drug approval and label 
process at the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;For the first time, Congress has required the agency to 
work closely with expert advisory committees before making 
critical product approval and labeling decisions and to make 
recommendations regarding educational programs for prescribers 
of extended release and long-acting opiates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;CARA also encourages the development and approval of 
opiates with abuse-deterrent properties. We also have to make 
sure resources such as the State-targeted response to the 
opiate crisis grants administered by the Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration continue to give States 
the tools they need to experiment and test best practices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;New Jersey recently secured a $13 million Federal grant 
from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration to focus on this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;The Drug-Free Community Support program in the White House 
Office of National Drug Control Policy also recently awarded 
Community in Crisis and two other able organizations Hunterdon 
Prevention Resource and EmPoWER Somerset, each with a $125,000 
grant to assist addressing the problem of opiate and heroin 
abuse, provide education, and implement prevention measures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Community in Crisis Hunterdon Prevention Resource and 
EmPoWER Somerset are great partners in connecting people with 
the resources and support they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;These investments are not only the right thing to do but 
help lessen the significant strain on law enforcement 
resources. I commend each group on its important work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Leonard Lance&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I stand ready to work with you and colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to continue this work. Thank you for 
calling this hearing today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess, for organizing this 
conversation today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;The Energy and Commerce Committee has done a lot right in 
the fight against drug addiction. Last year's landmark 
legislation set up lanes for success but it is going to be up 
to this committee to make sure the administration, the 
respective agencies and all stakeholders continue this effort 
to implement the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 
2016 and do all we can for those in need. I think today's 
Member Day demonstrates we are committed to doing that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;The opioid crisis is devastating families and communities 
across the Garden State. In 2015, New Jersey's heroin death 
rate was two-and-one-half times the skyrocketing U.S. rate. We 
are making progress with CARA's implementation but there is 
much more work to be done. Too often we are hearing about 
another life cut short from the scourge of drug addiction. This 
is not just a New Jersey problem, but an epidemic facing the 
entire country. We need to be working together and empowering 
the groups and organizations that are succeeding in turning the 
tide against drug abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;I would like to acknowledge the efforts of one of my 
constituents, Basking Ridge resident Clodette Sabatelle. 
Clodette has done critical work and has made a difference in 
the lives of those suffering from drug addiction. Her advocacy 
group, Community in Crisis, helps empower and equip the loved 
ones of those in pain. None of the progress we have made so far 
in this fight against drug addiction and opioid abuse would 
have been possible without the work of people like Clodette and 
organizations like Community in Crisis. Their efforts equipped 
Congress to act and helped craft and champion the CARA 
legislation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;I worked closely with Clodette on the issue of over 
prescription. In 2012, health care providers wrote 259 million 
prescriptions to people for opioids. The CARA provisions I 
authored address that issue by reforming and improving the 
medical drug approval and label process within the Federal Food 
and Drug Administration. For the first time, Congress has 
required the agency to work closely with expert advisory 
committees before making critical product approval and labeling 
decisions and to make recommendations regarding education 
programs for prescribers of extended-release and long-acting 
opioids. CARA also encourages the development and approval of 
opioids with abuse-deterrent properties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;We also have to make sure resources such as the State 
Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis Grants administered by 
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
continue to give States the tools they need to experiment and 
test best practices. New Jersey recently secured a $13 million 
Federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration to prioritize five specific strategies: 
strengthening public health surveillance, advancing the 
practice of pain management, improving access to treatment and 
recovery services, targeting availability and distribution of 
overdose-reversing drugs and supporting cutting-edge research.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;The Drug-Free Communities Support Program the White House 
Office of National Drug Control Policy also recently awarded 
Community in Crisis and two other very able organizations, 
Hunterdon Prevention Resource and Empower Somerset, each with a 
$125,000 grant to assist addressing the problem of opioid and 
heroin abuse, provide education and implement prevention 
measures. Community in Crisis, Hunterdon Prevention Resource 
and Empower Somerset are great partners in connecting people 
with the resources and support they need. These investments are 
not only the right thing to do, but help lessen the significant 
strain on law enforcement resources. I commend each group on 
its important work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

on both sides of the aisle to continue this work. Thank you for 
calling this hearing today.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;We will move to our second panel. Members identified

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. DORIS O. MATSUI, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. DORIS O. MATSUI"&gt;    So the Chair recognizes Ms. Matsui of California for 3 
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for inviting us today
to testify about proposals to address our Nation's opioid 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;We all have heartbreaking stories of constituents whose 
lives were lost too soon to an opioid overdose. In my home 
district of Sacramento, they have experienced a particularly 
deadly overdose crisis last year due to pills contaminated with 
fentanyl, which is as much as 50 times stronger than heroin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Addiction is a devastating disease that knows no bounds and 
we must come together to provide solutions in a comprehensive 
manner. In this committee, we took a step forward by passing 
the Comprehensive Addition and Recovery Act into law last year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;We need to build on these efforts. Understanding addiction 
and its consequences are multipronged and we need a 
multipronged solution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;I look at this problem as I do any other health care 
problem, which means I examine it holistically across the 
spectrum from prevention to early intervention to treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;In the case of the opioid epidemic there is a lot we can do 
at each of these stages, all of which rest on truly building up 
our Nation's mental health system and integrating behavior 
health care with physical health care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Historically, mental health and addiction have bee treated 
as character flaws and therefore not addressed with evidence-
based medical treatment. We can reverse that course by making 
treatment more available, bolstering our mental health work 
force, and reducing stigma.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;In 2012, Representative Lance and Senators Stabenow, Blunt, 
and I passed the Excellence in Mental Health Demonstration 
Project into law. This project is allowing States to 
demonstrate that building up Community-Based Behavioral Health 
Clinics improves access to care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Last week, we introduced legislation to extend the years of 
the program and expand it to more States. We should strongly 
consider this as one way to help address the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;We also need to enforce mental health parity laws to make 
sure health insurers are offering mental health benefits equal 
to physical health benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;However, this work on parity is irrelevant if mental health 
benefits are not offered in the first place. There have been 
proposals which included provisions that allow States to waive 
essential health benefits, meaning insurance once again not be 
required to cover mental health and addiction treatments. 
That's not good.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Cutting billions from the Medicaid program would also mean 
loss of coverage from millions suffering from substance use 
disorder. We cannot take these steps backward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;I am encouraged by steps being taken across the health care 
sector to address the crisis including the limiting of opioid 
prescriptions for prescribes and insurers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;We need to build on these efforts. That includes 
considering proposals in Congress to provide resources and 
training for State and local enforcement and bolstering a 
mental health workforce, educating the public, addressing 
availability of a range of treatment options from outpatient to 
inpatient to residential care and more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;And I do look forward to continuing to work with the 
committee on these policy proposals to address this pressing 
issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for inviting us to testify today 
about proposals to address our Nation's opioid epidemic. We all

    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;Addiction is a devastating disease that knows no bounds and 
impacts us all, and we must come together to provide solutions 
in a comprehensive manner.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;In this committee, we took a first step by passing the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, into law 
last year. We need to build on those efforts; understanding 
addiction and its consequences are multipronged, we need a 
multipronged solution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;I look at this problem as I do any other health care 
problem or disease, which means I examine it holistically 
across the spectrum from prevention to early intervention to

    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;In the case of the opioid epidemic, there is a lot we can 
do at each of these stages, all of which rest on truly building 
up our Nation's mental health system and integrating behavioral 
health care with physical health care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;If people are able to get behavioral health treatment when 
they need it in their communities, we can start to address the 
root causes of addiction and prevent and catch issues earlier. 
Historically, mental health and addiction have been treated as 
character flaws and therefore not addressed with evidence-based 
medical treatment. We can reverse that course by making 
treatment more available, bolstering our mental health 
workforce, and reducing stigma.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;In 2012, Rep. Lance and Senators Stabenow, Blunt, and I 
passed the Excellence in Mental Health Demonstration project 
into law. This project is allowing States and local communities 
to demonstrate that building up Community-Based Behavioral 
Health Clinics, in coordination with physical health clinics 
and community resources, will improve access to care. This 
project is currently in eight States, and last week we 
introduced the Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction 
Treatment Expansion Act to extend the years of the demo and 
expand it to more States. We should strongly consider this 
project and legislation as a way to build up community care to 
address the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;We also need to ensure that mental health parity is truly 
achieved. When an insurance company offers mental health 
benefits, they should be equal to physical health benefits 
offered. We need to ensure that this rule is being followed 
across the country. However, the rule is irrelevant if mental 
health benefits are not offered in the first place. Trumpcare 
proposals have included provisions that allow States to waive 
essential health benefits, meaning insurers would once again 
not be required to cover mental health and addiction treatment. 
Cutting billions of dollars from the Medicaid program would 
also mean loss of coverage for millions of Americans suffering 
from substance use disorder. We cannot take these steps 
backward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;I am encouraged by steps that are being taken across the 
health care sector to address the crisis. Prescribers and 
insurers are limiting opioid prescriptions , such as for pain 
following a surgery, to seven days. This prevents bottles of 
extra unused pills from sitting in people's medicine cabinets, 
as do prescription drug ``take back'' days where people can 
turn in unused pills to the DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Doris O. Matsui"&gt;    We need to build on these efforts and work together across 
the system. That includes considering proposals in Congress 
that provide resources and training for State and local law 
enforcement, bolstering our mental health workforce, educating 
the public on what they can do to prevent or react to a crisis, 
addressing the availability of a range of treatment options 
from outpatient to inpatient to residential care, and more. I 
look forward to continuing to work with the committee on policy 
proposals to address this pressing issue.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Bilirakis, 
for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;The United States is in the midst of an opioid overdose 
epidemic. Sadly, 91 Americans die every day due to opioid 
overdoses. Nearly half of all opioid overdose deaths involve a 
prescription opioid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;In 2010, in response to the opioid crisis in Florida's pill 
mill problem, Florida's legislature enacted statewide tracking 
of painkiller prescriptions coupled with law enforcement using 
drug trafficking laws to prosecute providers caught over 
prescribing. Within 3 years, Florida saw a decrease of more 
than 20 percent in overdose deaths.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Despite this positive trend, opioid abuse continues to 
plague my district. In fact, my district had the second-highest 
prescription drug death rate in Florida in 2014.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;In response, I worked last Congress to ensure that Pasco 
County was included as a high-intensity drug trafficking area, 
enabling law enforcement to receive additional resources to 
combat the spread of drug-related crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;I want to applaud the committee for including my bills, the 
Medicare Patient Safety and Drug Abuse Prevention Act and the 
Promise Act in CARA, which passed last Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;The Medicare Patient Safety and Drug Abuse Prevention Act 
created a pharmacy and physician block-in program within the 
Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, giving CMS the tools to 
crack down on this abuse in the Medicare program and it's 
important for us to maintain oversight, of course, as you know, 
on this program as CMS is developing the rules.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;The Promise Act will increase safety for opioid therapy and 
pain management by requiring the VA and DoD to update their 
clinical practice guidelines for managing of opioid therapy for 
chronic pain, requiring the VA opioid prescribes to have the 
enhanced pain management and safe opioid prescribing education 
and training and encourage the VA to increase information 
sharing with State licensing boards. I think that is critical.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Florida has received 
over $27 million in grants to help fight the opioid epidemic by 
increasing access to treatment and recovery services, 
strengthening public health surveillance, and improving pain 
management practices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;These critical funds are supporting Florida's all-hands-on-
deck approach across the State to curb opioid abuse and save 
lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;I am pleased the administration and this committee are 
leading the charge on this critical issue and I look forward to 
working together to help save lives and prevent addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;Thank you Mr. Chairman for hosting today's Member Day to 
discuss the impact of opioid abuse in our communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;The United States is in the midst of an opioid overdose 
epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, more citizens died from drug overdoses in 2015 than 
any other year on record. Of those deaths, six out of ten 
involve opioids. Last year, an estimated 60,000 Americans died 
due to drug overdoses, more than all the Americans who died in 
the Vietnam War. Sadly, 91 Americans die every day due to 
opioid overdoses. Nearly half of all opioid overdose deaths 
involve a prescription opioid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;Florida has been in the crosshairs of this epidemic. In 
2010, in response to the opioid crisis and Florida's `pill 
mill' problem, Florida's legislature enacted statewide tracking 
of painkiller prescriptions coupled with law enforcement using 
drug trafficking laws to prosecute providers caught 
overprescribing. Within 3 years, Florida saw a decrease of more 
than 20 percent in overdose deaths.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;Despite this positive trend, opioid abuse continues to 
plague my district--Florida's 12th District. Pasco and Pinellas 
counties had some of the highest oxycodone-caused deaths-almost 
200 in 2014. In fact, my district had the second-highest 
prescription drug death rate in Florida in 2014. In response, I 
worked last Congress to ensure that Pasco County was included 
as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA), which has 
enabled law enforcement to receive additional resources to 
combat the spread of drug-related crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;Additionally, I invited the head of the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy to visit my district last year. We toured 
local facilities and met with law enforcement, key health care 
providers, patients, and experts to determine the next steps in 
addressing this problem. I want to applaud the committee for 
including my bills, the Medicare Patient Safety and Drug Abuse 
Prevention Act and PROMISE Act in the Comprehensive Addiction 
and Recovery Act which passed last Congress. The Medicare 
Patient Safety and Drug Abuse Prevention Act created a pharmacy 
and physician lock-in program within Medicare Advantage and 
Medicare Part D. Private insurance was already using this 
strategy against doctor and pharmacy shopping, and States had 
adopted it as part of the Medicaid program. This gives CMS the 
tools to crackdown on this abuse in the Medicare program, and 
it's important for us to maintain oversight on this program as 
CMS is developing the rules. Furthermore, the PROMISE Act will 
increase safety for opioid therapy and pain management by 
requiring the VA and DOD to update their Clinical Practice 
Guidelines for Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain, 
requiring VA opioid prescribers to have enhanced pain 
management and safe opioid prescribing education and training, 
and encourages the VA to increase information sharing with 
State licensing boards.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;As part of the 21st Century Cures Act this Congress, 
Florida has received over $27 million in grants to help fight 
the opioid epidemic by increasing access to treatment and 
recovery services, strengthening public health surveillance, 
and improving pain management practices. These critical funds 
are supporting Florida's all-hands-on-deck approach across the 
State to curb opioid abuse and save lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;Now the rise in fentanyl and its various derivatives have 
presented new challenges to my State. However, we remain 
optimistic with Florida's recent legislative initiatives 
including:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Requiring doctors to log prescriptions in a 
statewide painkiller database by the end of the next business 
day to curb `doctor shopping';&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; And setting aside State funds for medications that 
can help reduce opioid dependency, most of which will be spent 
in the State prison system.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Gus M. Bilirakis"&gt;    We need to continue to work closely with local law 
enforcement, medical professionals, addiction treatment 
specialists, and those impacted by addiction. I am pleased the 
administration and this committee are leading the charge on 
this critical issue, and I look forward to working together to 
help save lives and prevent addiction. Thank you and I yield 
back the remaining balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. 
Butterfield, for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Butterfield&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Burgess, and to
my fellow colleagues. Thank you for opportunity to address the 
committee today about the state of the opioid epidemic in my 
home State of North Carolina.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;And let me just begin, Mr. Chairman, by crediting my friend 
and our former colleague, Mary Bono, who was also up from 
Florida--Mr. Bilirakis, who talked so incessantly about this 
issue because it was very dear to her and she knew the impact 
that it was having on her State.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;Ms. Mack brought this important topic to the forefront of 
our subcommittee some years ago. She was the chairman of the 
subcommittee, and I was the ranking member.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;At first, Mr. Chairman, I thought Mary was a little bit 
overreacting to the opioid crisis in Florida because it had 
touched her family personally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;But after we had hearings and after I looked into it, I 
came to the conclusion that she was not overreacting--that it 
was indeed an epidemic not just in Florida but all across the 
country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;Just last year, I worked with many of my colleagues in this 
room on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that was 
passed into law. That bill included, roughly, 20 different 
legislative proposals to help slow the epidemic. As part of the 
21st Century Cures Act, this committee approved $500 million.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;The American people need to know that, Mr. Chairman. We 
approved $500 million in supplemental funding to address opioid 
abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;Despite the investments and attention from Congress, we are 
still feeling the opioid crisis very close to home. During the 
August work period I saw the effects of the epidemic on my 
small community in Wilson, North Carolina. Just in August 
alone, there were two deaths because of the opioid abuse in the 
community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;According to reports in the Wilson Times--and I have a copy 
of that with me today--medics in Wilson County administered the 
appropriate drug in response to opioid crisis 28 times by mid-
August, when they usually administered the treatment 30 times 
per quarter.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;According to Chris Parker with the Wilson County Emergency 
Medical Services, there is a definite increase in opioid use 
and abuse in our county.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;North Carolina has a real problem on its hands. America has 
a real problem on its hands. By July of this year, there were 
more than 500 diagnoses for emergency department visits, up 
from 410 at the same point last year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;Regrettably, Mr. Chairman, in my humble opinion, the 
administration is not taking this situation seriously. The 
budget offered by the current administration cuts HHS funding 
by 16 percent, the CDC by 17 percent, the National Institutes 
of Health by 19 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;I am also very concerned about the proposals to get the 
Medicaid program that we have considered in this committee. The 
Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that nearly 
100,000 people with an opioid use disorder have gained coverage 
through Medicaid expansion under ACA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;Congress must do all that it can to help stop this epidemic 
from devastating more lives, more families, and communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;Congress should provide certainty--certainty and funding to 
combat this epidemic, which is why I am the original cosponsor 
of H.R. 3495, the Opiate and Heroin Abuse Crisis Investment Act 
of 2017 that was introduced by Mr. Lujan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;We must also protect existing fundings for research in 
opioid use disorder coverage, provide tools to communities to 
address this epidemic, and reduce the stigma for those needing 
treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;So I want to thank you for convening this hearing. I want 
to thank Mr. Latta, Mr. Bucshon, Mr. Bilirakis, and all of you 
for your time, your attention, and your energy to this issue 
because it is an emergency in our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. G.K. Butterfield"&gt;Thank you. I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. G.K. Butterfield"&gt;Chairman Burgess, thank you for the opportunity to address 
the committee today about the state of the opioid epidemic in 
North Carolina.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. G.K. Butterfield"&gt;I credit my friend and colleague Mary Bono Mack with 
bringing this important topic to the forefront of this 
committee's work to protect public health. As ranking member of 
the subcommittee previously known as Subcommittee on Commerce, 
Manufacturing and Trade, I worked closely with Representative 
Bono Mack to ensure the supply chain for potentially dangerous 
narcotics is airtight.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. G.K. Butterfield"&gt;Just last year, I worked with many of my colleagues in this 
room on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that was 
passed into law. That bill included roughly twenty different

still feeling the opioid crisis close to home in North 
Carolina. During the August work period, I saw the effects of 
the epidemic on my community in Wilson, North Carolina.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. G.K. Butterfield"&gt;Just in August alone, there were two deaths because of 
opioid abuse in Wilson. According to reports in The Wilson 
Times, medics in Wilson County administered Naloxone in 
response to opioid crises 28 times by mid-August, when they 
usually administer the treatment 30 times per quarter. 
According to Chris Parker with Wilson County Emergency Medical 
Services, ``there is a definite increase in opiate use in 
Wilson County.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. G.K. Butterfield"&gt;North Carolina has a real problem on its hands. By July of 
this year, there were more than 500 opioid diagnoses for 
emergency department visits, up from 410 at the same point in 
2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. G.K. Butterfield"&gt;Clearly, the administration is not taking this situation 
seriously. The budget offered by the Trump administration cuts 
HHS by 16 percent, the CDC by 17 percent, and that National 
Institutes of Health by 19 percent. I am also very concerned 
about the proposals to gut the Medicaid program that we have 
considered in this very committee. The Center for Budget and 
Policy Priorities estimates that nearly 100,000 people with an 
opioid use disorder have gained coverage through Medicaid 
Expansion under the ACA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. G.K. Butterfield"&gt;Congress must do all it can to help stop this epidemic from 
devastating more lives, families, and communities. Congress 
should provide certainty in funding to combat this epidemic, 
which is why I am original cosponsor of H.R. 3495, the Opioid

Wilson Times for the record. I yield back.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. LARRY BUCSHON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF INDIANA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. LARRY BUCSHON"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Bucshon, 
for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bucshon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, thank
you for holding this important hearing today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Opioid abuse disorder has ravaged our communities, and 
while it is important to look forward and address what else 
needs to be done to combat this terrible disease, we need to 
ensure the legislation we have already passed is being properly 
implemented and is working as Congress intended.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;In July 2016, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery 
Act--CARA--landmark legislation addressing the opioid abuse 
crisis was passed into law. I spent months convening 
stakeholder round tables and working on bipartisan language 
which became Section 303 of CARA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Section 303 updates the Controlled Substances Act and 
office-based opioid addiction treatment laws by ensuring that 
patients are offered and physicians are trained on all FDA-
approved treatments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Under previous law, prior to CARA millions of opioid-
addicted patients had their treatment determined based on their 
setting of care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;With the passage of CARA, patients in these settings must 
now be offered a full range of treatment options based on their 
individual clinical needs and individualized treatment plan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Unfortunately, 15 months after the legislation was signed 
into law, Section 303 still has not been implemented. I urge 
the committee to conduct strong oversight to ensure SAMHSA will 
be properly implementing the law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Every day that this law goes unimplemented is one more day 
that our family members, friends, and colleagues are battling a 
disease with fragmented and incomplete treatment options.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Specifically, SAMHSA should send a dear colleague letter to 
notify physicians that they must offer all anti-addiction 
medicines based on a patient's clinical needs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Additionally, curriculum for doctors, PAs, and nurse 
practitioners should be updated to include training on all FDA-
approved opioid addiction medications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;Moreover, all of SAMHSA's public-facing material, including 
their Web site, should be modernized to reflect this patient-
centered approach.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;According to the Evansville Courier and Press, 55 people in 
Vanderbergh County, Indiana, have died of a drug overdose in 
the first nine months of this year, which is more than all of 
2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;The availability of all medication-assisted treatments 
regardless of where a patient chooses to seek them will help to 
stem the tide of these unnecessary deaths.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bucshon"&gt;It is vital that as the committee moves forward in the 
fight against opiate abuse disorder that we ensure CARA is 
properly implemented and helping people combat this terrible 
disease.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT E. LATTA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF OHIO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. ROBERT E. LATTA"&gt; Gentleman yields back. Chair thanks the
gentleman and recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Latta, 
for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Latta&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again, thank
you for holding this hearing today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Opioid abuse and addiction has caused devastation in every 
community across our Nation and Ohio has been especially hard 
hit. In Ohio, in 2015, 3,050 people lost their lives from 
unintentional drug overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;In 2016, that number increased to 4,050. That's a 32 
percent increase from the previous year and that means 11 
deaths a day. For comparison, in 2016, there were 1,133 traffic 
fatalities in Ohio.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;That means that drug overdoses cause nearly four times as 
many deaths compared to traffic accidents. These figures are 
heartbreaking and sad to know that this problem isn't getting 
any better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Many county coroners in Ohio say that 2017's overdose 
fatalities are outpacing 2016's. This problem knows no limits 
and has affected husbands, wives, children, brothers, sisters, 
fathers, and mothers. It has destroyed marriages, ruined 
careers, and cut too many lives short.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;When I read through the obituaries in my local newspapers 
over the past year or two I have noticed more younger 
individuals without a cause of death being listed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Unfortunately, in too many of instances it is because of 
drug overdoses. Across my district in northwest and west 
central Ohio, I have heard how opioid addiction impacts our 
communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;I have toured businesses and met with community leaders and 
spoke with families to hear how substance use disorders have 
directly affected their lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;It is because of these stories that I plan to introduce 
legislation that would direct the Department of Health and 
Human Services to create a public electronic database of 
information relating to nationwide efforts to combat the opioid 
crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;The database would serve as a central location of 
information for the public and others to track Federal funding 
allocations made available for research and treatment of opioid 
abuse, find research relating to opioid abuse from all Federal 
agencies, State, local, and Tribal governments as well as 
nonprofits, law enforcement, medical experts, public health 
educators, and research institutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;Furthermore, the legislation would charge HHS to evaluate a 
myriad of issues relating to pain management, addiction, 
prescription guidelines, treatments, trends and patterns, and 
effective solutions to problems used across the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;These findings would be available on the database as well 
and HHS would be instructed to offer recommendations for 
targeted areas of improvement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;I believe that with the help of HHS and other relevant 
agencies this database will allow for easier access of 
information, funding streams, and relevant data that can help 
to combat the opioid abuse epidemic across our Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Latta"&gt;With 11 people dying every day in Ohio and over 91 
Americans dying nationwide every day, we have run out of time 
to find a solution to this crisis. We need action now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

lives being saved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta"&gt;Opioid abuse and addiction has caused devastation in every

    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta"&gt;In 2016, Ohio lost at least 4,050 people from unintentional 
drug overdose. That's a 32 percent increase from the previous

    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta"&gt;For comparison, in 2016, there were 1,133 traffic

wives, children, brothers, sisters, fathers, and mothers. It 
has destroyed marriages, ruined careers, and cut lives far too 
short.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta"&gt;I frequently read obituaries in my local newspaper, and 
over the past year or two I started to notice a pattern of 
younger individuals without a cause of death. I soon realized 
that no cause was listed because they had died from a drug 
overdose. This happens far too often.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta"&gt;All across my district in Northwest and West Central Ohio, 
I've heard how opioid addiction impacts our communities. I've

    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta"&gt;These findings would be available on the database as well 
and HHS would be instructed to offer recommendations for 
targeted areas of improvements.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta"&gt;I hope that with the experts at HHS, and other relevant 
agencies, this database will allow for easier access of 
information, funding streams, and relevant data that can help

    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta"&gt;With 11 people dying every day in my home State of Ohio,

    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The Chair wants to thank all the Members on this panel for 
your testimony. You are now excused, and we will seek the next 
panel, and I----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Butterfield&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt; Mr. Chairman, a parliamentary inquiry.
Did----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; The gentleman will state his parliamentary
inquiry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Butterfield&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;I am not sure that is the right
terminology. But I wanted to include into the record two 
newspaper articles that I referenced.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt;    Have I lost my right to do that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; Is the gentleman asking unanimous consent?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Butterfield&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt; I am. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Without objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Butterfield&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Butterfield"&gt; Thank you.

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And the Chair now would ask that the next

Brooks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And, again, members of the committee are welcome to provide 
their testimony from their seated position on the dais or from

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. BILL JOHNSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF OHIO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. BILL JOHNSON"&gt;    And, Mr. Johnson, I will recognize you for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this
discussion about an issue that is so vitally important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;It is no secret that America is in the midst of an opioid 
crisis. Last year, in my home State of Ohio alone, about 86 
percent of overdose deaths involved an opioid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;This epidemic can be felt in virtually every community 
across the country and today I want to share a story that will 
shed some light on some of the good work being done by people 
in my district to help combat the opioid epidemic and to 
perhaps let everyone know about some of the positive things 
that are taking place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Recently, I had the honor of visiting Field of Hope, a 
faith-based nonprofit treatment facility in southeastern Ohio 
that assist area families ravaged by poverty and drug abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Field of Hope Recovery House was founded by a man named 
Kevin Dennis after he witnessed his own daughter become 
addicted to opioids after she had knee surgery from a high 
school athletic injury.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Her prescriptions ran out before her pain was managed. But, 
unfortunately, by that point, she was addicted. She ended up in 
prison several times for theft and checked into numerous rehab 
facilities before she fully recovered from addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;She is now a recovery counselor at Field of Hope and is 
happily married with a child. I heard some incredibly powerful 
and touching stories during my visit to the Field of Hope 
Campus and I witnessed the good work they are doing firsthand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;We, in Congress, and especially in this committee have an 
important role to play in supplementing and enabling the work 
being done by organizations like Field of Hope.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;On the front end, we need to develop prevention policies 
that steer people like Kevin's daughter away from opioids in 
the first place. Innovative nonopioid nonaddictive treatments 
exist today and more are on the way. But this--these innovative 
treatments are not always covered by Federal programs like 
Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;We should closely examine the reimbursement policies in 
place to ensure that patients have access to effective 
alternatives for pain management without the risk of addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I've also been encouraged by recent efforts by private 
payers, providers, pharmacists, and patient groups to address 
the addiction crisis through increased awareness, prescribing 
guidelines, and new treatment options. I believe Congress can 
play a role in ensuring that all prescribers are equipped with 
education in pain management so they can provide effective pain 
treatments for patients and timely intervention for those who 
are addicted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on 
the committee and in the House to find effective solutions to 
this scourge.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Bill Johnson&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Bill Johnson"&gt;Mr. Chairman, it is a national crisis. We need to act, and, 
with that, I yield back the balance of my time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Bill Johnson"&gt;It is no secret that the United States is in the midst of

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF VERMONT&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. PETER WELCH"&gt;    The Chair is then pleased to recognize the entire Vermont 
delegation. Mr. Welch, you are recognized for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;We don't have the numbers of Texas, but I
appreciate the recognition.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;First of all, Dr. Burgess, thank you, and Mr. Green, thank 
you--your taking time to focus attention and demonstrate the 
urgency of this challenge.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Second, this so affects us all. I mean, it's heartbreaking 
and it doesn't matter whether it's a red district or a blue 
district. It doesn't matter what your view is on the size and 
scope of Government. This is hurting people in your district, 
Dr. Burgess and Mr. Green, and in my district and my 
colleagues' here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;In Vermont, our Governor dedicated his entire State of the 
State Address to this epidemic in 2014, and I remember at that 
time many of my colleagues asked the question, ``Peter, isn't 
this going to do bad things for the reputation of Vermont,'' 
but then acknowledged that what he was saying was true in their 
own State--in their own districts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;So you focussing attention on it, Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
That is step number one. I can give you some statistics in 
Vermont but they would be very similar to Mr. Johnson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;I mean, our prescription drug problems with individuals 
increased from 2,477 in 2012 by 80 percent. Heroin went from 
913 in 2012 and increased to 3,488--a 380 percent increase. 
Every one of those stories is a story of family heartache.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;I mean, I got a letter from a mom whose 27-year-old son 
became addicted to heroin and just the story about him being 
homeless, him going from being a full time working person to 
being out on the street, him--her having to call her daughters, 
saying that their brother may soon be dead--all of that is real 
and all to vivid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;So this is an enormous challenge. Our job in Congress is to 
come up with some policies that are going to help people help 
themselves and I would like to make a few suggestions of things 
that we need to do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Number one, we do have to have funding. We have to have 
full funding for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, 
and we've got to find the money in order to allow our 
communities to do that work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Two, we have to have more research into alternative 
treatment. I am working with Mr. McKinley to try to get the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to find better 
alternatives to treat pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Three, let us allow for partial filling of opioid 
subscriptions. Many of us have signed letters that would allow 
that to happen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Four, let's support the recent action by Commissioner 
Gottlieb. He has done some good things. Immediate release--he 
is trying to get immediate release opioid manufacturers to 
follow a more stringent set of REMS requirements which includes 
training doctors to safely prescribe these drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;So this hearing is tremendous--focusing attention. The next 
step is to put this into legislative action.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Peter Welch&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Peter Welch"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Peter Welch"&gt;First of all, Dr. Burgess, thank you, and Mr. Green, thank 
you, you're taking time to focus attention and demonstrate the

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF INDIANA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;The Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Indiana, Mrs. 
Brooks, for 3 minutes, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Ranking Member Green, for hosting this incredibly important 
hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;Too many Americans are struggling with the crippling 
effects of drug abuse and addiction and the statistics, as we 
know, are devastating.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;According to the Indiana State Department of Health, every 
2 1A\1/2\ hours, a Hoosier is sent to the hospital for an 
opioid overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;Across our State there are enough bottles of painkillers in 
circulation for nearly every Hoosier to have their own and the 
number of infants born addicted to opioids is increasing at an 
alarming rate with health care costs for these babies costing 
Indiana more than $64 million in 2014 alone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;And as we know, like so many other States, Hoosiers are now 
more likely to die from a drug overdose than a car accident.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;When I came to Congress in 2013, I had been very focussed 
on our communities and families that this epidemic has swept 
up. And like so many of my colleagues, we have held round 
tables. We have held meetings. We have met with addicted 
individuals' families. We have been on the front line with 
prescribers, health care workers. We all agree this is a 
Federal problem and a local problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;Last year, we passed CARA, which included my bill to 
establish an interagency task force to review, modify, and 
update the best practices for pain management and prescribed 
pain medicine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;HHS has already taken steps informing this task force, but 
more needs to be done. In my view, it is critical to ensure 
that the medical professionals have continuing medical 
education for the prescribing of DEA-controlled substances that 
have such a high risk of abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;I am exploring options to ensure that physicians and other 
medical professionals who prescribe these schedule drugs have 
more and better education linked to the application and renewal 
of their DEA licenses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;Professionals who prescribe and dispense opioid medications 
must have better training so that they fully understand those 
patients who, sadly, have gotten the onset of addiction due to 
what they've been prescribed and now they need even better 
education to help prevent that onset and then to help them with 
the addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;Indiana is tackling our problems head on and in fact just 
yesterday Indiana University announced a new initiative called 
Responding to the Addictions Crisis. It is being led by IU's 
Dean of Nursing, Robin Newhouse. IU is committing $50 million 
over the next 5 years to collaborate with State and community 
partners to tackle this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;It is going to be one of the most comprehensive State-based 
responses and every IU campus in the State is going to be 
involved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;It is going to focus on training and education, data 
collection and analysis, policy analysis and development, 
addiction sciences, community and workforce development.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;So major steps are being taken across our State because 
everyone has a role to play, from our prescribers to our 
medical, to our higher ed institutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;And I want to remind folks that DEA has a national 
prescription drug take-back day. It is approaching on October 
28th.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS"&gt;It provides that safe, convenient, responsible way to 
dispose of excess prescriptions drugs so that people can get 
those drugs out of their medicine cabinets and out of our kids' 
reach. And not just kids--to adults. So there are going to be 
locations all across the country and I really encourage 
everyone because everyone has a role to play. And so October 
28th is National Take-Back Day and I hope that we get that word 
out.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Susan W. Brooks&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;Too many Americans are struggling with the crippling 
effects of drug addiction and abuse and too many families are 
grieving the loss of a loved one to an overdose. Since I joined 
Congress in 2013, I have been committed to helping people 
overcome this sweeping epidemic. According to the Indiana State 
Department of Health, every 2 1A\1/2\ hours, a Hoosier is sent 
to the hospital for an opioid overdose. Across the State there 
are enough bottles of painkillers in circulation for nearly 
every Hoosier to have their own. The number of infants born 
addicted to opioids is increasing at an alarming rate, costing 
Indiana more than $64 million in 2014 alone. Hoosiers are now 
more likely to die from a drug overdose than a car accident; 
Indiana is one of four States where the fatal drug overdose 
rate has quadrupled since 1999, ranking us 15th in the country 
in overdose fatalities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;At home in the district, I have pursued answers to this 
epidemic through roundtables and meetings with individuals and 
families on the front lines of this crisis, prescribers and 
health workers and first responders, and community leaders. I 
have visited the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Saint 
Vincent's Hospital in Indianapolis to see firsthand the 
devastating effects of infants born addicted to opioids and who 
must already fight for survival through withdrawal in their 
very first days on this earth. I meet with juvenile court 
judges and social workers whose caseloads have doubled as more 
and more children are being removed from their parents' care 
because their parents are more concerned about where to find 
their next high than the welfare of their child and it is no 
longer safe for them in their home. Indiana first responders 
tell me they are overwhelmed with the unprecedented increase in 
drug overdoses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;Last year Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and 
Recovery Act which included significant resources and reforms 
to combat this crisis; the measure included my bill to 
establish an inter-agency task force to review, modify, and 
update best practices for pain management and prescribe pain 
medicine. Although we've made great strides to turn the tide of 
the epidemic, we need to do more to bring prescribers in as 
part of the solution and help educate people struggling with 
substance abuse and their families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;Just a few months ago, I met with the Grant County 
Substance Abuse Task Force at Marion General Hospital and heard 
from community leaders how important it is to fight this crisis 
at a Federal AND local level. In order to do this, it is 
critical that our first responders have the equipment they need 
to safely respond to situations where toxic substances are 
present. We must also educate the youngest members of our 
communities of the dangers of substance abuse, and ensure our 
kids do not have access to harmful prescription drugs. As part 
of my ongoing effort to combat this crisis, I will be 
participating in the DEA's National Prescription Drug Take Back 
Day on October 28. This provides a safe, convenient, and 
responsible way to dispose of excess prescription drugs, while 
also providing an opportunity to raise awareness of the opioid 
crisis and to educate our friends, family members, and 
neighbors about the potential for abuse of medications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;Indiana is tackling the problem head-on. I trust our State 
and local partners to do what's necessary to address this 
crisis and it is a priority for Governor Holcomb. He recently 
established a Commission to Combat Opioid Abuse and, just 
yesterday, Indiana University announced it committing an 
investment of $50 million to collaborate with State and 
community partners to tackle this crisis, making it one of the 
Nation's largest and most comprehensive State-based responses. 
Major steps are being taken across the State, proving that it 
will take everyone--from the Federal Government to individuals 
in our communities--do their part to combat this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Very well, and of course, I thank the

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the chairs and
ranking members for the opportunity to discuss how New Mexico 
has been impacted by the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;Five hundred and one New Mexicans died of drug overdose 
deaths in 2015. Across this country, there were 52,404 deaths 
in 2015 and more than 560,000 deaths between 1999 and 2015--a 
half a million people who missed Thanksgiving dinner or their 
daughter's softball game, who weren't able to help their son 
with math homework or kiss their spouse good night.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;That's brothers and sisters, parents and friends and 
children that we have lost too soon because in part Congress 
has not responded forcefully enough to the crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;Last Congress, we did important work by passing the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--CARA--and 21st 
Century Cures Act. These were steps in the right direction but 
these efforts alone are not enough.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;I have heard from my community that the funding passed in 
Cures is helpful but hard to use. In part, this is because of 
the short funding period which impacts communities' ability to 
plan for the long-term and expand capacity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;We know that in two many areas like New Mexico there are 
simply not enough people and resources. Many want help and 
can't get it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;I am reminded of a story relayed to me by one of my 
constituents, Jay, who have stopped using heroin on his own--
who felt as if he was going into relapse and sought help at a 
local treatment facility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;Jay was told, come back when you are using. He was turned 
away and told to come back only if he started using again 
because they lacked the capacity to treat patients who were not 
active drug users. That's simply not right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;To really expand the treatment prevention and wraparound 
services that our constituents need, we must increase funding 
and create stability. We need to give local governments and 
organizations the ability to plan and not fear losing vital 
support from Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;Most of all, we need to give constituents like Jay a place 
to go after he's fought a tough fight on his own. That's why I 
introduced the Opioid and Heroin Abuse Crisis Investment Act to 
continue the funding to combat the opioid epidemic we passed in 
21st Century Cures for an additional 5 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;I would welcome my colleagues' support because we 
absolutely must extend this funding for an additional 5 years 
and beyond.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;However, this still isn't enough, which is why we must look 
at new efforts to drive vital investments to help those in need 
and address the barriers to appropriate quality and accessible 
treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;These barriers include a decaying rural mental health and 
substance abuse treatment infrastructure, lack of regional 
coordination of treatment resources, lack of support for rural 
physicians providing substance abuse treatment, administrative 
barriers against the most effective form of opioid abuse 
treatment, and a shortage of rural physicians who provide 
medication-assisted treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;We as a committee must recognize that hoping for the best 
is not valid public policy--there is a quick fix to solve the 
opioid crisis. That is simply not true.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;We need to advance serious legislation that takes into 
account long-term planning for the Federal Government and for 
States and communities. We need to bring it to the floor of the 
House, send it to the Senate, get it passed, and to the 
president's desk.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;I fear that until we recognize this fact we will continue 
to lose brother's and sisters, parents and friends, and 
children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Lujan"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding this important 
hearing and finding a way for us to work in a bipartisan 
fashion to address this important issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. NANCY PELOSI, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. NANCY PELOSI"&gt; If the Minority Leader is ready, then, yes, we
will recognize you for--you are recognized.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pelosi&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Rep.
Mullin, for your courtesy. I really came to listen as well as 
to convey some thoughts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;This is only the second time I've ever testified as Leader 
or as--in that capacity because this issue rises to the level, 
as you know, of life and death. And so, with gratitude to you 
and to the ranking member, Mr. Green, for bringing us together 
in a bipartisan way on this issue that is a matter of life and 
death.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Burgess.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;The opioid epidemic, again, is taking a savage daily toll 
on the American people. We know that, and regardless of who 
they are or where they live, they are in every district in the 
country, as we know.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;The scourge is tearing families apart, have an impact on 
the well-being of our children, hollowing out communities. It 
has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Americans every 
year, on average robbing 91 people of their lives each day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;Again, just to testify to that--I know it's a matter of 
your record here. Opioid addiction is a public health 
catastrophe and is growing more dire and deadly every day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;And I believe that it is really important for us to respond 
to this national emergency with the seriousness and urgency it 
requires. Fortunately, we have had bipartisanship in passing 
legislation--the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;We all came together during the bipartisan legislation that 
was passed--the 21st Century Cures Act that people were so 
happy that the addiction language was in there. That day we 
heard the stories of families so affected--break your heart--
families who had lost a child, a young teenager or 21-year-old 
or whatever within a matter of days or weeks before that 
particular signing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;President Obama signed that legislation. But it had the 
language. It just hasn't had the money to the adequate extent 
and that, Mr. Chairman, is my appeal to you for our Democrats 
and Republicans to work together to have the funding to fund 
the key initiatives authorized in the bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;I do want to make a pitch for Medicaid be built on the 
progress. The ACA's Medicaid expansion has provided a vital 
lifeline for tens of thousands of Americans struggling with 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;As Governor of Ohio, our former colleague, John Kasich, 
noted, thank God we expanded Medicaid, because that Medicaid 
money is helping to rehab people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;Yet 19 States have not taken that step. We stand ready to 
work with you, Mr. Chairman, in good faith with Republicans to 
update and improve the ACA but we remain vigilant against 
efforts to gut Medicaid because it will create even more of a 
problem in terms of opioids, just to name one thing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt;The opiate epidemic is a challenge to the conscience of the 
entire country. We must, again, act urgently and boldly to get 
America's families the prevention treatment and recovery 
resources they need, and in that regard I said we must work 
with providers in the pharmaceutical industry to push effective 
prevention measures so we can reduce unnecessary prescriptions 
and stop this epidemic at the source.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Nancy Pelosi&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Knowing of your busy schedule, I will submit my entire 
statement for the record. Again, thank you for the courtesy of 
being able to testify before your committee and thank you for 
your leadership on this important issue, and thank you, Mr. 
Green, as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Thank you all for being here to shine a light on the 
devastating epidemic of opioid addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Opioid addiction is inflicting a savage daily toll on 
Americans--regardless of who they are, where they live or how 
much money they make.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;This scourge is tearing apart families and hollowing out 
communities. It is claiming the lives of tens of thousands of 
Americans every year--robbing an average of 91 people of their 
lives each day and driving down the national life expectancy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Opioid addiction is a public health catastrophe. And it is 
growing more dire and deadly each day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Serious, Urgent Action&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;We must respond to this national emergency with the 
seriousness and urgency it requires.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;We must increase funding and improve capacity, so that 
health systems and providers can offer high-quality, evidence-
based opioid addiction treatment, including medication-assisted 
treatment and recovery support services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;It is unacceptable that our Nation lacks the capacity to 
treat nearly half of the men and women who suffer from opioid 
use disorders;&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;We must also improve access to treatment--combatting the 
stigmas, cost and misperceptions that prevent people from 
accessing care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;And we must work with providers on effective prevention 
measures--so we can limit opioid supply, and stop this epidemic 
at the source.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;CARA Funding&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Fortunately, Congress has already created the tools to 
improve prevention and expand access to care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Last year, Democrats and Republicans worked together to 
pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--a landmark 
bill to provide the full continuum of care to those suffering 
from opioid addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;But, unfortunately, the Republican Congress has so far 
failed to adequately fund the key initiatives authorized by 
this bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;There is no room for politics in the life-or-death fight 
against opioid addiction. We cannot shortchange the resources 
needed to fight the tragedy of opioid addiction in our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Congress is appropriating billions to rebuild communities 
after natural disasters--we must show a similar commitment to 
rebuilding communities ravaged by opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;ACA Medicaid Expansion&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;We must also build on the progress of the ACA's Medicaid 
expansion, which has provided a vital lifeline for tens of 
thousands of Americans struggling with opioid addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;As Ohio Governor John Kasich noted, ``Thank God we expanded 
Medicaid, because that Medicaid money is helping to rehab 
people.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Yet, 19 States still have not taken the step of extending 
the life-saving benefits of Medicaid coverage. We must work 
with States to expand Medicaid, so we can bring urgently needed 
care to men and women fighting for their lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Democrats stand ready to work in good faith with 
Republicans to update and improve the ACA. But we will remain 
vigilant against any effort to gut Medicaid or create higher 
costs for less care for families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;Close&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;The opioid epidemic is a challenge to the conscience of the 
entire country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Hon. Nancy Pelosi"&gt;    We must act urgently and boldly to get America's families 
the prevention, treatment and recovery resources they need. 
Thank you, all, for your leadership in this fight.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;The Chair thanks the Minority Leader for being
here today. You are welcome to stay and listen to the testimony 
of the other Members, but we also respect your schedule, and if 
you need to leave, that is certainly understandable as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    But in the meantime, I will recognize Mr. Mullin for 3 
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pelosi&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt; Thank you for your hospitality. I will listen.
I will listen.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; Well, yes, I will recognize the gentleman from
Texas.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Green&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Thank you, Leader, for being here. But before
Mr. Mullin testifies, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank him 
for his work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;Literally, when the water was going down in Houston, you 
called me and said, ``I have some churches in Tulsa who want to 
partner with your churches.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Green"&gt;    So we did that, and instead of having one week's worth of 
your folks from your Cherokee Nation, I think they stayed a 
month, helping my seniors and disabled clean out their 3 or 4 
feet of water in their house, and I didn't realize they had 
that drywall skills. So thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Pelosi&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Pelosi"&gt; As one with a daughter in Houston, and
grandchildren, I thank you as well.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. MARKWAYNE MULLIN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. MARKWAYNE MULLIN"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mullin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;Mr. Green, thank you. Cherokee Nation called us
right off the bat and said, ``How can we help?,'' and we had 
churches reach out to us, and we have been very fortunate to 
work together on multiple issues here in Congress. It has been 
a friendship that carried past that and it was a--it was an 
honor to be able to help your constituents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Green, for allowing us to 
talk about such an important epidemic that is going across our 
Nation. We talk often about the opioid epidemic. But what are 
we talking about as far as how did we get here and then how do 
we go back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;We never want to talk about taking medicine backwards. But 
I stand--I sit in front of you, from a gentleman who's had 
surgeries since I was a little boy. I was born with my hips out 
and my feet in club--in the club feet position and I started 
having surgeries very young. I also built up a very large pain 
tolerance. And I have never been one to use pain medicine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;Now, my wife says that I am different than most. I think 
most people in this room would probably agree with that. But I 
do understand pain, and I understand the need for medicine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;But in '96 when pain became a sense and, in my opinion, we 
let the genie out of the bottle. We started treating it like it 
was something that can be treated like a cold or the flu, and 
all we do is mask it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;And we've seen stronger and stronger drugs coming out. 
We've seen them become controlled substance--narcotics--that we 
send home simply in a bottle with a prescription and say that 
is--that is controlled.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;Now we've seen an epidemic spread from the middle class to 
the low class to the wealthy and to our mothers and our 
fathers, to our brothers and our sisters and our coworkers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;When do we put the genie back in the bottle? How do we 
continue to allow drugs--addictive drugs--continue to be sent 
home with our loved ones? The highest percentage of death--of 
accidental opioid deaths--are mothers--middle-age women. Most 
of them got addicted to them after birth or an elective 
surgery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;How is that possible? How do we let it continue to move 
down that path and not say that we have to do something bold 
about this? When it's a controlled substance, why do we allow 
it to go home? Wouldn't that be better treated in the hospital?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;We talk about a lot of remedies but we have got to go back 
to where it started, and it started when we started treating it 
like a sense.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;I am very proud to be on this subcommittee. I am very proud 
that, Chairman Burgess, you are taking a very heavy interest in 
this and I am proud that Chairman Murphy had took an interest 
in this, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;And that is why we are proud to be able to pick up one of 
his bills. It is H.R. 3545 that will at least allow doctors 
after surgery to be able to access records to know if that 
person has an addictive behavior so we are not sending those 
type of drugs home with them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Mullin"&gt;I look forward to continuing to work with the committee. I 
look forward to finally being able to put some type of remedy 
in bringing this to a closure and quit hurting our families 
back home, and I hope that we can approach this in a bipartisan 
approach, put politics aside, and put families first.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;It's so common to hear from the media about the dysfunction 
of Washington. It's so uncommon to hear the success stories. As 
a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I've been 
working on legislation related to opioid abuse since March of 
2015, when our committee led a number of bipartisan initiatives 
to help address the opioid epidemic. That year, we were 
successful in passing numerous pieces of legislation through 
committee and through the House.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;In July of 2016, President Obama signed the Comprehensive 
Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, into law--which included 
over a dozen bills passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Our committee is a productive one and the legislation passed 
helps fight the opioid epidemic from the ground up.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;The Comprehensive Addiction and Recover Act (CARA) and the 
21st Century Cures Act offered a truly comprehensive response 
to the opioid epidemic and touches on prevention, criminal 
justice reform, access to treatment, overdose reversal, and 
recovery. The final bill included an amendment that I offered, 
which ensures that the Attorney General considers the needs of 
Native Americans, rural communities, and communities heavily 
impacted by opioid overdose deaths when awarding grants.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;Overprescribing painkillers has been a significant driver 
in the opioid and heroin epidemic, which is why CARA and CURES 
created a task force to review best practices for chronic and 
acute pain management and prescribing pain medication. It 
improved access to the overdose treatment and the opioid 
reversal drug naloxone and it expanded NIH opioid research.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;Just last week in my district, the Claremore Police 
Department used the opioid reversal drug, Narcan, for the first 
time in the field. The victim, who was found unconscious and 
admitted to using opioids, was taken to the hospital for 
further treatment after police were able to administer the 
Narcan drug. These success stories are taking place nationwide, 
thanks to CARA and CURES. I am very proud to have worked on 
CARA and CURES, but there is still more work that needs to be 
done.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;Oklahoma has been hit hard by the epidemic. Our Attorney 
General has filed a suit against opioid manufacturers, Cherokee 
Nation has filed a suit against drug distributors and 
pharmacies, and our Governor has assembled an Oklahoma 
Commission on Opioid Abuse. In 2014, Oklahoma had the 10th-
highest drug overdose death rate in the Nation. More people 
died from overdoses than in car crashes. My district also has 
two of the five counties in the entire State that have the 
highest rates of unintentional painkiller overdoses--Coal and 
Muskogee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;We can all agree that more needs to be done to address this 
crisis, which is why I have worked with my colleague Rep. 
Katherine Clark to introduced H.R. 3528, the Every Prescription 
Conveyed Securely (EPCS) Act. The EPCS Act would direct all 
States to employ electronic prescribing for controlled 
substances (EPCS) technology for Medicare Part D transactions 
by 2020. This is a step that seven States have already taken in 
an effort to combat the crisis and better secure the 
prescription distribution chain. So far all of our policy has 
been reactive, and this policy is proactive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;This policy prevents large amounts of opiates from ever 
reaching the addicts hands and dramatically decreases doctor 
shopping. The EPCS Act will provide real-time reporting and 
ensure that the information gathered by electronic medical 
records can be used in a meaningful way. Electronic prescribing 
solutions, currently provided by more than 20 companies, are 
used like an app on the Electronic Health Records and give 
prescribers feedback on when prescriptions are filled and with 
what drug.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;According to the Department of Justice, most illegally 
obtained prescription opioids are obtained either through 
doctor shopping, forged prescriptions, and theft, which can be 
addressed by an EPCS regime. Another piece of legislation I am 
supportive of is H.R. 3545, the Overdose Prevention and Patient 
Safety Act, also known in the Senate as Jessie's Law. This 
legislation would help put the laws governing the medical 
records of those struggling with addiction into the 21st 
Century.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;Currently, a law that was passed in 1972 still governs how 
doctors and health care professionals share alcohol or 
substance use disorder treatment records. Under this law, when 
a patient goes to receive treatment at an addiction treatment 
facility, their medical records will remain segregated from the 
patient's overall medical record. This puts the patient at 
tremendous risk because doctors can no longer know their 
patient's substance use or history of care. In the case of 
Jessie Grubb, this outdated law was fatal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;Jessie, who was in substance use recovery, went in for 
routine surgery, and providers were informed by her parents 
that she should not be given opioids except under strict 
supervision. However, upon discharge Jessie was prescribed 50 
oxycodone pills, and the hospital pharmacy filled the 
prescription because her substance use disorder treatment 
history was not in her medical record. That night, she died as 
the result of an overdose. Doctors cannot safely treat their 
patients if they don't know the whole story. H.R. 3545 would 
prevent tragedies like Jessie's and bring the Part 2 law into 
the 21st century.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Markwayne Mullin"&gt;    Our committee has done good work to combat the opioid 
epidemic, but our work isn't done. We can do more. We can 
inspire more success stories, but our work starts here. I urge 
my colleagues today to support these two bills and continue our 
dedication on this committee to combating the deadly opioid 
epidemic. I yield back the remainder of my time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL TONKO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROMTHE STATE OF NEW YORK&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. PAUL TONKO"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. Tonko, 
for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you, Chair Burgess and Ranking Member
Green, and members of the subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;We are a nation in crisis. The opioid epidemic is wreaking 
havoc in our communities at an unprecedented scale with CDC 
estimating 64,000 dead from drug overdoses in 2016--an 
astonishing 21 percent increase from the previous year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;This public health disaster is costing us more lives 
annually than at the peak of the AIDS epidemic--as many lives 
as gun violence and traffic accidents combined.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;If this Congress doesn't find additional solutions to turn 
the tide on the opioid epidemic, we will be complicity in this 
American tragedy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;I am here today to offer two such legislative solutions. 
First, I introduced the Addiction Treatment Access Improvement 
Act--H.R. 3692--with my good friend, Congressman Ben Ray Lujan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;This legislation would expand access to medication-assisted 
treatment by allowing certified nurse midwives and other 
advanced practice registered nurses to prescribe buprenorphine 
and, in addition, this legislation would codify the 2016 rule 
that allowed physicians to treat up to 275 patients with 
buprenorphine and eliminate the sunset of a provision that 
allows nonphysician providers to prescribe MAT.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;The Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act would 
particularly benefit pregnant and post-partum women who are 
struggling with addiction and improve outcomes for the over 
13,000 infants that are born each year with neonatal abstinence 
syndrome.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Despite the expansion of medication-assisted treatment in 
the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, there is still a 
significant shortage in treatment capacity, resulting in 
individuals waiting months, if not years, to receive effective 
addiction treatment. Only 20 percent of patients who need 
treatment for opioid use disorder are currently receiving it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Let me repeat that. Only 20 percent of patients who need 
treatment for opioid use disorder are currently receiving it. 
The Addiction Treatment Access Improvement Act would address 
this treatment gap and save lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;This committee should act on this bipartisan legislation 
without delay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;The second bill I'd like to discuss is the Medicaid Reentry 
Act--H.R. 4005. This legislation is a targeted attempt to 
address the problem of overdose deaths that occur post-
incarceration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Studies have shown that individuals who are released back 
into the community post-incarceration are, roughly, eight times 
more likely to die of an overdose in the first two weeks post-
release compared to other times.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;The risk of overdose is elevated during this period due to 
reduced physiological tolerance for opioids amongst the 
incarcerated population, a lack of effective addiction 
treatment options while incarcerated, and poor care transitions 
back into the community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;The Medicaid Reentry Act would grant States flexibility to 
restart Medicaid coverage for Medicaid-eligible individuals 30 
days pre-release.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;By allowing the Medicaid benefit to restart prior to 
release, States would be able to more readily provide effective 
addiction treatment pre-release and would allow for smoother 
transitions to community care, reducing the risk of overdose 
deaths post-release, striking an overall wiser use of scarce 
Medicaid dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Let me be clear: This legislation that I've introduced 
would not expand Medicaid eligibility in any way. It would 
simply grant States new flexibility to restart an individual's 
Medicaid benefits 30 days earlier than allowed under current 
law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;This increased flexibility would dovetail with innovative 
reentry programs already being championed by Republicans and 
Democrats in States across our country and would give 
individuals reentering society a fighting chance to live a 
healthier drug-free life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Let me just end with an urgent plea for action and 
bipartisanship. I know that many of the ideas that this 
committee will hear today would, in normal times, be met with 
the typical partisan objections and end up stuck in a 
procedural morass.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;These are not normal times. When your house is on fire you 
don't look to see whether the firefighter is wearing red or 
blue uniforms before they turn their hoses on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;If we are truly going to make a difference in this crisis 
and save lives, we have to have a big heart and an open mind.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;I thank my colleagues for their time and for their 
consideration of this legislation that I have presented and, 
again, to the chair, ranking member, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for offering such, you know, attention 
to a crisis that has gripped this country in severe measure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. RICHARD HUDSON"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. 
Hudson, for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hudson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess and Ranking Member
Green, for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf of my 
constituents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;As has been noted, the opioid epidemic is not an isolated 
issue. It is a nationwide issue and it deserves our attention. 
The New York Times noted last month that the opioid epidemic is 
killing more people per year right now than the HIV epidemic 
did at its peak in the '90s.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;These drugs do not discriminate based on gender, race, 
social class, or age, and they destroy lives, families, 
marriages, and careers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;In my home State of North Carolina, the opioid epidemic has 
really hit hard. North Carolina is home to four cities in the 
top 25 of worst cities affected by the crisis, one of which is 
in my district, Fayetteville, North Carolina.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;One particularly devastating story that stuck with me from 
a constituent I met while touring a treatment facility last 
year in my district, he was a police captain, the son of the 
police chief in the same town, and he injured his back on the 
job and was prescribed an opioid following his surgery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;He told me he vividly remembers the moment he became 
addicted the first time he took one of these medications. 
Within a year, he was a full-blown heroin addict. He's since 
recovered and now mentors addicts through treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;Unlike many stories, this is a story with a happy ending. 
Fayetteville has become home to soldiers and veterans--or is 
the home of soldiers and veterans who have become addicted 
after being prescribed opioids for injuries sustained in combat 
or training.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;The tragedy is that the VA does not have enough inpatient 
beds to treat every veteran and so oftentimes veterans go 
without help and are forced to self-medicate by using opioids 
found on the black market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;This is outrageous and it is unacceptable. We need to find 
real solutions so we can put an end to this heartbreak.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;I am proud to have worked last Congress with this 
committee's investigation into opioid addiction which resulted 
in the passage of both the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery 
Act and the 21st Century Cures Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;These laws have made huge steps forward in the treatment 
and prevention of opioid addiction but it is clear we have work 
left to do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;One idea I am working on is expanding access to safe ways 
to dispose of prescription drugs, particularly opioids. 
DisposeRX is a company in my district that manufacturers a 
powder that mixes with water inside the pill bottle and renders 
any unused opioids not only inaccessible and inextricable but 
also biodegradable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Hudson"&gt;It is innovation ideas like this that we need to explore 
and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the 
committee to help treat and prevent this opioid addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kennedy&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and many thanks to
the ranking member, Mr. Green, as well for convening this 
hearing and for bringing all of us together--our colleagues 
from across the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;I also want to thank my colleagues that have testified 
already. Their comments, I think, are right on. I think they 
show the depth of this epidemic across the country and how it's 
affected so many in our districts from around our Nation and 
the myriad ways in which our Federal Government can help 
respond to it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;There is no silver bullet to this but there are ideas out 
there that are, I think, genuine that have widespread support 
and that I hope will deserve this committee's attention, going 
forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;Addiction, as many know, is not a disease that knows 
congressional districts or State borders or electoral college 
results. It is not one that cares about how much money is in 
your bank account or asks how many children you have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;For patients and families on the front lines of this 
epidemic today it is personal, it is painful, and it is 
petrifying.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;The question, I think, before all of us isn't is there an 
epidemic. I think you've heard from everybody today saying that 
there is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;The question is how do we go forward. My colleagues have 
outlined some of their solutions. I wanted to touch on a couple 
of broad themes as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;First and foremost is Medicaid. Medicaid, as of now, covers 
about 30 percent of all nonelderly adults with an opioid 
addiction in this country--30 percent--and the 20 percent of 
opioid addicts that do not have health insurance largely stems 
from individuals in States that did not take a Medicaid 
expansion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;This is not enough. We need to strengthen our Medicaid 
programs to ensure that everybody gets the care that they need 
when they need it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;That means not just ensuring access to Medicaid and 
eligibility but it means fleshing out the networks that 
Medicaid provides so that you don't have the stories that so 
many of us have heard from folks around the country of even if 
they are enrolled in Medicaid that there are not providers that 
will take it, and if providers do take it that they would have 
wait months in order to get a slot to get into treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;There is complex reasons for that but, in my own opinion, a 
big portion of that comes through low Medicaid reimbursement 
rates that ends up putting the burden of treatment on the backs 
of providers rather than making sure that patients get the care 
that they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;Second is law enforcement. Folks, we lock people up in this 
country that are sick and we need to be doing an awful lot more 
not only to make sure that that safety net for our mental 
health system is not a criminal justice system but supporting 
our first responders and police officers who end up being on 
the front lines of this epidemic and addiction epidemic across 
the country and put in an impossible place of forcing to have 
to arrest people, forcing to put themselves in danger because 
our mental health system is not robust enough.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;I was a State prosecutor. We threw people in jail that were 
sick. They would break into homes and cars to try to satiate an 
opioid epidemic--an opioid addiction because they didn't have 
anywhere else to go.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;Finally--and I will be brief, Mr. Chairman--the medical 
community. You heard Mrs. Brooks talk about education. We have 
heard folks talk about prediction of drug monitoring programs. 
We have heard folks talk about prescription guidelines. All of 
those need to be on the table.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;I, like Mr. Mullin, have had surgery before. I got in an 
argument with a surgery technician on my hospital bed who was 
trying to prescribe me pain killers that I wouldn't take 
because I am so deathly afraid of these things. That part needs 
to change.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;I look forward to working with my colleagues in the weeks 
and months ahead to try to make sure that our Government does 
take the step forward we need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Kennedy"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks everyone on this panel. We will allow you to 
depart, and we have a panel that will be Mr. Costello of 
Pennsylvania, Mr. Walberg of Michigan, Mr. Carter of Georgia, 
and Chairman Goodlatte of Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And Mr. Walberg, we are doing Energy and Commerce members 
first. But with your permission, I will go to the Chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee since he has made time to be with us 
this morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. BOB GOODLATTE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. BOB GOODLATTE"&gt;    And Chairman Goodlatte, you are recognized for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Goodlatte&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Green, members
of the committee, thank you very much for the opportunity to 
testify about the opioid crisis in America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;This crisis affects Americans across all socioeconomic 
levels in all regions of the country, including in my home 
district in Virginia, and has rightfully gained the attention 
of Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;According to the Northern Shenandoah Valley Substance Abuse 
Coalition, they have seen 11 opioid overdoses resulting in four 
deaths since September 20th, making 33 deaths in that portion 
of my district so far this year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;Just recently, I met with a mother in Roanoke whose 
daughter is an opioid addict living on the streets. Her concern 
for her daughter was heartbreaking to hear.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;Sadly, I know that every Member of Congress in this room 
has heard these stories of bright futures wasted away and lives 
taken too early.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;That is why we must act to provide more tools to help 
addicts reclaim and rebuild their lives, stop drug traffickers, 
and make our communities safer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;We at the Judiciary Committee have been pleased to work 
with the committee on Energy and Commerce in this fight to 
combat this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;Since last year, the Judiciary Committee has passed seven 
legislative measures that address the multifaceted nature of 
the opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;Notably, the Judiciary and Energy and Commerce Committees 
worked collaboratively to see the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse 
Reduction Act--CARA--signed into law last year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;This bipartisan legislation combats the opioid epidemic by 
establishing a streamlined comprehensive opioid abuse grant 
program including vital training and resources for first 
responders and law enforcement, criminal investigations for the 
unlawful distribution of opioids, drug and other alternative 
treatment courts, and residential substance abuse treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;We have also targeted those who traffic in opioids. The 
Transnational Drug Trafficking Act, which is now law, improves 
law enforcement's ability to pursue international drug 
manufacturers, brokers, and distributors in source nations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;Federal prosecutors can now use the important tools in that 
bill to pursue foreign drug traffickers who are poisoning 
American citizens.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;Additionally, in July of this year, the Judiciary Committee 
reported favorably the Stop the Importation and Trafficking of 
Synthetic Analogs Act. It is an unfortunate reality that 
synthetic drug use and the opioid epidemic are inextricably 
linked. Heroin is regularly laced with synthetic drugs such as 
fentanyl.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;This bill ensures that our laws keep pace with the creation 
of new chemically altered drugs and provides law enforcement 
with the tools needed to keep these drugs off of our streets.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;That legislation, I believe, is currently before the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. I hope you will take a very close look 
at it and if we can pass it out of the committee I am sure it 
will pass the House with a very strong vote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Goodlatte"&gt;Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify. My dedication to curtailing the opioid 
crisis is unwavering and I look forward to our continued work 
together to that end.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Bob Goodlatte&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Bob Goodlatte"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Bob Goodlatte"&gt;Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone, thank you for 
the opportunity to testify about the opioid crisis in America. 
This crisis affects Americans across all socioeconomic levels 
in all regions of the country--including in my home district in 
Virginia--and has rightfully gained the attention of Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Bob Goodlatte"&gt;According to the Northern Shenandoah Valley Substance Abuse

    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Bob Goodlatte"&gt;The Committee on Energy and Commerce, as well as the House 
Judiciary Committee, of which I currently serve as chair, has 
been active in the fight to combat this epidemic. Since last 
year, the Judiciary Committee has passed seven legislative 
measures that address the multifaceted nature of the opioid 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Bob Goodlatte"&gt;Notably, the Judiciary and Energy and Commerce Committees

    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; The Chair thanks the gentleman. Thanks for
making time to be with us on our panel today. We sincerely 
appreciate you being here. We know we have got work to do, and 
we will work together on this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. TIM WALBERG, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. TIM WALBERG"&gt; Mr. Walberg, you are recognized for 3 minutes,
please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am always
delighted to go behind the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
especially since there are some of my bills in this committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;But let me say, Chairman Burgess and Ranking Member Green, 
I want to thank you for holding today's hearing to receive 
input from members who represent different corners of our 
country and yet the very same problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Since the heroin and opioid crisis came to the forefront, I 
have heard so many devastating stories about families losing 
loved ones. I have toured recovery centers, talked with 
survivors who continue to battle addiction and ridden along 
with law enforcement to understand the challenges that they 
face in keeping our neighbourhoods safe.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;I have also met a number of amazing compassionate 
individuals--fellow citizens who have stepped up and are 
leading the fight in their communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to meet with a 
constituent named George Barath from Monroe County. He 
established Ryan's Hope Foundation, a nonprofit organization 
named in honor of his son who died from a heroin overdose in 
2012.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;He was only 25. Ryan's Hope funds structured long-term 
residential treatment for addicts and so far they have helped 
nearly--helped nearly 40 addicts by sending them to rehab.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;To help cover these costs, Mr. Barath has also teamed up 
with local first responders to organize a charity hockey game 
called Hockey Against Heroin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;In Lenawee County, my own home county, the Pathways 
Recovery Engagement Center just opened its doors last week. I 
got a chance to see the center in August when it was in the 
final stages of construction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;This recovery-based program in downtown Adrian is the 
result of a community partnership between local police and the 
county sheriff's office, Rotary Clubs, and the local hospital 
system and mental health authority.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Ryan's Hope and the Pathways Resource Center are just two 
shining examples of constituents in my district making a 
difference. We need more community-based initiatives like these 
to get resources to those in need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;But Congress also has more to do. One example is Jessie's 
Law, a bipartisan bill I have introduced with Congresswoman 
Debbie Dingell. It seeks to ensure that medical professionals 
are equipped to safely treat their patients and prevent 
overdose tragedies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;It is named after Jessie Grubb, who died last year of an 
opioid overdose. Jessie had battled a heroin addiction for 
nearly 7 years but had been clean for six months. She had made 
a new life for herself in Michigan and was training for a 
marathon when an infection related to a running injury required 
her to have surgery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Jessie's parents told doctors that she was a recovering 
addict and shouldn't be prescribed opioids. Unfortunately, 
Jessie's discharging physician didn't know her addiction 
history and sent Jessie home with a prescription for 50 
oxycodone pills. Jessie became a sad death by overdose 
statistic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Jessie's law will ensure that physicians and nurses have 
access to a consenting patient's complete health information 
when making treatment decisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Tim Walberg&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Tim Walberg"&gt;Such information is crucial to provide a patient-centered 
care, prevent relapses, and ultimately save lives. As we work 
together to address this crisis, it is my hope the stories and 
ideas shared today will inform our efforts and ensure we pursue 
meaningful solutions to remove obstacles to care and empower 
local communities to tackle the opioid crisis head on, and I 
thank you for listening to my story.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Tim Walberg"&gt;Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, I want to thank you

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. HAROLD ROGERS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. HAROLD ROGERS"&gt;    Mrs. Bustos, if you wish to join us now, that would be good 
as well. And Chairman Rogers, thank you for being here and 
being part of this discussion this morning. You are recognized, 
sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and colleagues.
Thank you for hosting us on this very, very important topic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Over the past 15 years, many of you have heard me advocate 
for a holistic approach to the calamity that we face, including 
enforcement, prevention, and treatment measures like those 
successfully implemented by Operation Unite in Kentucky.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;We need to further encourage regional collaboration on this 
issue that ignores lines on a map, and I hope to work with the 
committee on this issue in the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Today, however, Mr. Chairman, I would like to focus on 
treatment. Despite the light we've shown on addiction, only 10 
percent of those needing treatment for alcohol or drug-related 
addiction actually receive it--10 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Underlying challenges in the treatment workforce further 
compound this lack of access. There are simply not enough 
incentives for health professionals in training to specialize 
in addiction medicine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Treatment professionals work in stressful environments, 
receive relatively low pay, and turn over at rates much higher 
than other health professionals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;NIH continually pioneers research on addiction science and 
new ways to treat this chronic disease. Yet, America has only 
half the number of practising addiction specialists needed to 
put their findings in practice.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;This is a patient safety and public health calamity. 
Patients in need of addiction treatment often have access to 
specialized care in every corner of the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;That is why I will soon be introducing legislation with my 
colleague, Katherine Clark, to create a student loan repayment 
program for qualified substance use disorder treatment 
professionals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;This program will not only encourage health professionals 
to pursue careers in addiction medicine but steer them towards 
areas most in need of their services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Though it is not a silver bullet, this bill would be 
another substantial step in the right direction and I hope to 
work with each of you, Mr. Chairman and members, to this end 
and I thank you for allowing us here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Harold Rogers"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding this 
hearing to discuss Congress' continued work on opioid misuse 
and abuse. Over the past 15 years, many of you have heard me 
advocate for a holistic approach to addiction, including 
enforcement, prevention, and treatment measures like those 
successfully implemented by Operation UNITE in Kentucky. We 
need to further encourage regional collaboration on this issue

    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;As a pharmacist, I have always made it a priority to advise 
and assist my patients with the medications they are 
prescribed. As a community pharmacist, I develop close bonds

pushes pharmacists to always act proactively in helping their 
patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;One of the largest concerns I have seen is the increased 
prescribing of opioids for pain relief. We need to look at 
other options and other outlets for the treatment of pain and 
find a good medium. I believe we can work with the FDA to 
prioritize nonopioid treatments for patients and create a 
channel for the approval of those therapies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;In addition, as it currently stands, prescribers are able 
to write up to three 30-day prescriptions or Schedule II drugs 
for patients. I believe it would be pertinent to reexamine that 
prescribing structure and look at the effectiveness of allowing 
fewer initial prescriptions and a limited number of refills 
rather than three months of prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Similar to that notion, allowing pharmacists to have a 
greater say in limiting the number of pills filled in a 
prescription could help to address the transition to addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;For instance, limiting the fill for acute pain needs such 
as a dental procedure could help prevent an individual from 
getting hooked on opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Under CARA, a pharmacist is only able to partially fill a 
prescription with the consent of the patient or prescriber or 
in the instance it doesn't have enough stock to fully fill a 
prescription.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;A simple seven-day fill could cover their pain needs and 
keep more pills out of potential use or circulation. 
Prescription drug monitoring programs--PDMPs--are a great 
resource in combatting prescription drug abuse. But they can be 
strengthened to better curb this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;One way to do so is to better align the data including in 
those PDMPs so that States can collaborate to create a more 
comprehensive picture of people's drug use. Further linking 
State PDMPs and including data in work flows could allow for 
more accuracy in how States monitor and respond to potential 
abuses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Drug take-back programs continue to expand across the 
country. Currently, at least 19 States have some form of drug 
take-back programs and 23 States have programs allowing 
pharmacists to accept unused and unwanted drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;One of the most common ways in which adolescents access 
prescription drugs is through the drug cabinets of their 
parents and grandparents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Too often these unused pills can act as a gateway to 
further abuse by young adults. Expanding these programs through 
law enforcement pharmacies or paid-for mail programs can take 
some of these prescription drugs off the street.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;The creation of middle grounds of therapies will provide 
for alternatives that are missing in today's market. By 
facilitating research and development, we can help drive the 
expensive and time-consuming efforts needed to make those 
treatments a reality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Currently, there are few options left between Tylenol, 
Tramadol, and opioids, and that void is driving prescription 
decisions across the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter"&gt;So thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee, for the 
opportunity to provide testimony here today and I look forward 
to working with everyone to tackle this issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter"&gt;Chairman Burgess and Ranking Member Green, I want to start 
my testimony by thanking you for holding today's hearing and 
for soliciting input from Members on how to continue to combat 
this growing epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter"&gt;As a pharmacist, I have always made it a priority to advise 
and assist my patients with the medications they are 
prescribed. As a community pharmacist, I developed close bonds 
with people who were often my friends and neighbors. That bond 
pushes pharmacists to always act proactively in helping their 
patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter"&gt;One of the largest concerns I have seen is the increased 
prescribing of opioids for pain relief. We need to look at 
other options and other outlets for the treatment of pain and 
find a good medium. I believe we can work with the FDA to 
prioritize nonopioid treatments for patients and create a 
channel for the approval of those therapies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter"&gt;In addition, as it currently stands, prescribers are able 
to write up to three 30-day prescriptions for schedule two 
drugs for patients. I believe it would be pertinent to 
reexamine that prescribing structure and look at the 
effectiveness of allowing fewer initial prescriptions and a 
limited number of refills rather than 3 months of 
prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter"&gt;Similar to that notion, allowing pharmacists to have a 
greater say in limiting the number of pills filled in a 
prescription could help to address the transition to addiction. 
For instance, limiting the fill for acute pain needs, such as a 
dental procedure, could help prevent an individual from getting 
hooked on opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter"&gt;Under CARA, a pharmacist is only able to partially fill a

    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter"&gt;Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are a great

be strengthened to better curb this epidemic. One way to do so

between Tylenol, Tramadol and opioids and that void is driving 
prescribing decisions across the country. We have an 
opportunity to support the efforts of NIH through public-
private partnerships to address this and other issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter"&gt;    Finally, as a lifelong pharmacist, I am never short of 
amazed at how my colleagues in our profession continue to 
evolve and excel in their roles advising patients. We now have 
an opportunity to capitalize on existing progress and to work 
with the administration, the FDA, and outside groups to right 
the ship on opioid abuses. I thank the committee for the 
opportunity to provide testimony and I look forward to working 
with everyone to tackle this issue.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. CHERI BUSTOS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;The Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois, Mrs. 
Bustos, for 3 minutes, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;Mrs. Bustos. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and also 
Ranking Member Green.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;I would like to start out by telling you a story about a 
young man from my congressional district in Rockford, Illinois. 
His name is Chris Boseman. I had the good fortune of meeting 
his mother, who told me this story.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;Chris passed away in the summer of 2014 when he was only 32 
years old. He had injured his back and as a result of that his 
physician prescribed an opioid to relieve his pain. Soon after 
that, he became dependent upon those--that prescription opioid 
and found out that he could go to the street and find something 
very cheap called heroin--$10.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;So he continued the cycle of overdose, rehab, relapse, and 
he was on the right path. He enrolled in a college called Rock 
Valley College, where he was studying construction management.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;But a year after being clean, he relapsed again and ended 
up passing away. And we know stories very similar to this are 
happening all over our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;And I was so proud when we came together, Democrats and 
Republicans, and actually passed some meaningful legislation 
on--to help address this opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;One of those bills that was included in that was to care 
for infants born with an opioid dependency due to their 
parents' addiction. In fact, we received the Government 
Accountability report that my bill called for very recently, 
and it reviews and makes recommendations to care for these 
infants.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;But what it really ended up showing is that we have a very 
long way to go. The Department of Health and Human Services has 
a strategy for improving infant care, but they haven't yet put 
this into practice.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;There is not even a protocol to screen and treat these 
newborn babies who are born addicted because of their parents' 
addiction. So it further reinforces that this is not the time 
to cut Medicaid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;Medicaid pays for four out of every five babies that are 
suffering from opioid withdrawal upon their birth. It has 
helped 1.6 million people with substance abuse disorders and 
access to treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;And I just really more than anything want to make the point 
that Medicaid has to be protected and not cut.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;I want to stress one other point because of the 
congressional district that I represent and that is that the 
opioid crisis is actually worse in rural communities where the 
drug-related deaths are actually 45 percent higher.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;Rural States have higher rates of overdose, especially 
prescription opioids like the kind that Chris had been 
prescribed for his back injury.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;So, you know, we don't have the resources to fight back at 
the level that we need to. We don't have enough physicians in 
rural America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;We don't have enough hospitals that are--with up-to-date 
technology to help with this crisis. We don't even have the 
needed transportation to reach these treatment centers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;So that is why earlier this year I introduced bipartisan 
piece of legislation to help rural communities better leverage 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture programs to combat heroin 
and opioid use.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="HON. CHERI BUSTOS"&gt;So we need to continue to look at solutions that work in 
rural areas like telemedicine, which will help us overcome the 
transportation and access issues that I mentioned earlier.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Cheri Bustos&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the rest of my time. 
Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;Thank you Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;Let me tell you about a young man from Rockford, Illinois 
named Chris Boseman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;Chris passed away in the summer of 2014. He was 32 years 
old.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;He was a kind, tender-hearted son and brother. A back 
injury led to a painkiller prescription that he soon became 
dependent on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;And when he could no longer fill that prescription, he 
began buying pain medication on the street.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;But as the costs added up, his dealer told him that heroin 
would give him the same effects . for only $10.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;After a continuing cycle of overdose, rehab, and relapse, 
Chris was enrolled in Rock Valley College and studying 
construction management when, after a year of being clean, he 
relapsed and died.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;This is happening every day, all across the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;I was proud that Congress came together last summer to pass 
legislation that helps communities address the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;Which included my bill to improve care for infants born 
with an opioid dependency due to their parents' addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;In fact, we just received the GAO's report that my bill 
called for.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;It reviews and makes recommendations to care for these 
infants. But really what it shows is that we have a long way to 
go.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;HHS has a strategy for improving infant care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;But they haven't put it into practice yet.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;There is not even a protocol to screen and treat these 
newborn babies who, through no fault of their own, are 
addicted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;Which further reinforces that this is not the time to cut 
Medicaid, which pays to treat over 80 percent--that's four out 
of every five--of our newborns suffering from opioid 
withdrawal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;And helped 1.6 million people with substance abuse 
disorders to access treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;It has dropped the uninsured rate for the mentally ill down 
to 5 percent in expansion States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;Medicaid must be protected, not cut.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;And I want to stress another point: the opioid crisis is 
worse in rural communities, where drug-related deaths are 45 
percent higher.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;Rural States have higher rates of overdose, especially from 
prescription opioids like the kind Chris was given by his 
doctor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;And we just don't have the resources to fight back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;We don't have enough doctors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;We don't have hospitals with up-to-date technology and 
services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;And we don't have public transportation to reach the right 
treatment centers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;That is why earlier this year I introduced bipartisan 
legislation to help rural communities better leverage USDA 
programs to combat opioid and heroin use.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Hon. Cheri Bustos"&gt;We need to continue to look at solutions that work in rural 
areas, like telemedicine, which will overcome transportation 
and access issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Dayton, Ohio, Mr. 
Turner, for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Turner&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member
Green, and members of the subcommittee. I want to thank you for 
the opportunity to appear before you today on this important 
issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;As the chairman said, I come from Dayton, Ohio. My counties 
in Ohio are Montgomery, Greene, and Layette, and despite our 
communities' efforts to battle the opioid epidemic for years, 
the epidemic continues to destroy my community and my 
constituents on a daily basis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;This year, current estimates suggest that 800 people could 
die in my primary county--Montgomery County--due to opioid 
overdose. Sadly, that would more than double the 371 drug 
overdose deaths from 2016, the highest number recorded to date. 
Imagine 800 families receiving notice that someone in their 
family has died as a result of opioid overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;Heartbreaking numbers like this have made Montgomery 
County, Ohio, ground zero in the fight against opioid abuse and 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;Recently, in working in conjunction with the county sheriff 
I have called for the appointment of a Dayton area drug czar to 
help us streamline and coordinate our region's response to this 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;While I have worked on a local basis to help stem this 
tide, today I would like to highlight my bill, H.R. 982, the 
Reforming and Expanding Access to Treatment Act--the TREAT Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;As the title suggests, the TREAT Act would increase access 
to substance abuse treatment by lifting two restrictions that 
hamstring full deployment of Federal resources.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;Medicaid's Institutions for Mental Disease Exclusion States 
that facilities with more than 16 beds, like jails, are not 
eligible for reimbursement for substance abuse treatment 
services furnished to individuals who are incarcerated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;Composing the problem, a Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Administration Policy dating to 1995 limits the use of grants 
from its Center for Substance Abuse Treatment--CSAT--to only 
community-based treatment facilities excluding those who are 
incarcerated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;My Treatment Act offers a common sense solution that would 
eliminate these barriers to treatment for individuals who are 
incarcerated by allowing Medicaid to reimburse for substance 
abuse treatment services furnished to individuals who are 
incarcerated. There is not reason why someone who is Medicaid 
eligible should lose their benefits the moment they become 
incarcerated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;Limiting the SAMHSA policy that prohibits the use of grant 
funding for providing substance abuse treatment to individuals 
who are incarcerated would also assist.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;Since I first introduced the TREAT Act in November of 2015 
and then reintroduced it in this Congress it has garnered a 
broad spectrum of support from law enforcement to medical 
providers to local jurisdictions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;The President's Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and 
the Opioid Crisis Interim Report, which was just issued July 
31st, 2017, strongly endorsed this concept that is in the TREAT 
Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;The White House Commission called lifting Medicaid's IMD 
exclusions, quote, ``the single fastest way to increase 
treatment availability across the Nation, noting that every 
Governor, numerous treatment providers, parents, and nonprofit 
advocacy group organizations have urged this course of 
action.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Turner"&gt;Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and members of the 
subcommittee, lives are at stake. This would be an important 
step to bring treatment to those individuals who are at a time 
we have an ability to intervene in their lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before 
you today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;I am Congressman Michael R. Turner, and I proudly represent 
Ohio's 10th Congressional District, which centers around the 
city of Dayton and includes Montgomery, Greene, and Fayette 
counties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;This morning, I will briefly explain how the opioid 
epidemic is ravaging the district I serve and propose possible 
solutions to what has become a national crisis of frightening 
proportions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;Despite battling against it for years, the heroin and 
opiate epidemic continues to destroy my community and my 
constituents on daily basis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;This year, current estimates suggest that 800 people could 
die in Montgomery County alone due to an opiate overdose. 
Sadly, that would more than double the 371 drug overdose deaths 
from 2016, the highest number recorded to date.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;The Montgomery County morgue regularly surpasses capacity 
and has even been forced to use refrigerated trailers to house 
victims' bodies. The coroner has described what is occurring as 
a ``mass-casualty event.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;To make matters worse, deadly synthetic opioids like 
fentanyl, which can be 50 times stronger than heroin, and 
carfentanil, which can be 5,000 times stronger, have flooded 
the Miami Valley.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;It is heartbreaking numbers and stories like these that 
have made Montgomery County, Ohio ``the overdose capital of 
America''--meaning that, per capita, more of my Montgomery 
County constituents are dying as a result of drug overdoses 
than anywhere else in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;Our struggle in southwestern Ohio mirrors that of countless 
other areas across the country--91 Americans die every day as 
the result of an opioid overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;These sobering statistics paint a picture of a country 
facing an exponentially growing epidemic of opioid abuse that 
is resulting in drastic increases in addiction rates, overdose 
deaths, and incarceration. The opiate crisis is tearing apart 
families, neighborhoods, cities, and indeed our society as a 
whole.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;While I have spearheaded several initiatives--in 
conjunction with State and local partners--to stem the tide of 
the opioid epidemic, today I would like to highlight my bill 
H.R. 982, The Reforming and Expanding Access to Treatment 
(TREAT) Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;As the title suggests, my TREAT Act would increase access 
to substance abuse treatment by lifting archaic restrictions 
that hamstring full deployment of Federal resources.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;The concept behind my TREAT Act originated from a tour of 
my district's Greene County Jail and Green Leaf Alcohol &amp;amp; Drug 
Treatment Program in August 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;During the visit, I discovered that individuals who are 
incarcerated cannot receive substance abuse treatment through 
Medicaid, even if they are otherwise eligible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;This is due to Medicaid's Institutes for Mental Disease 
(IMD) exclusion, which states that facilities with more than 16 
beds--like jails--are not eligible for reimbursement for 
substance abuse treatment services furnished to individuals who 
are incarcerated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;Compounding the problem, the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Administration (SAMHSA) currently prohibits the use of 
grants from its Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) for 
substance abuse treatment services provided to individuals who 
are incarcerated. Instead, this over 20-year-old policy limits 
use of such grants to only community-based treatment 
facilities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;These unnecessary restrictions act as obstacles, limiting 
our flexibility in how we employ the Federal resources that are 
so desperately needed to combat this growing epidemic and 
supply medical treatment to individuals suffering from 
substance abuse disorders and addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;My TREAT Act offers a common-sense solution that would 
eliminate these barriers to treatment for individuals who are 
incarcerated by:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Allowing Medicaid to reimburse for substance abuse 
treatment services furnished to individuals who are 
incarcerated; and&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Lifting the SAMHSA policy that prohibits the use 
of grant funding for providing substance abuse treatment to 
individuals who are incarcerated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;Since I first introduced the TREAT Act in November 2015 and 
reintroduced it this Congress, it has garnered a broad spectrum 
of support from law enforcement to medical providers to local-
level jurisdictions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and 
the Opioid Crisis' Interim Report, issued July 31, 2017, 
strongly endorsed the TREAT Act's core concept.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;The White House Commission called lifting Medicaid's IMD 
exclusion the ``single fastest way to increase treatment 
availability across the Nation,'' noting that ``every Governor, 
numerous treatment providers, parents, and nonprofit advocacy 
organizations'' have urged this course of action in an effort 
to combat the opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and members of the 
subcommittee, my constituents' lives and indeed the well-being 
of my entire community are at stake here, as are many of yours. 
They are under assault from an opioid epidemic, the likes of 
which have never been seen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;My TREAT Act can help put an end to the opiate crisis-but 
it cannot wait any longer. I urge you to work with me to report 
the TREAT Act out of committee, and support its passage in the 
House of Representatives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Hon. Michael R. Turner"&gt;    Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today, and 
I look forward to addressing any questions or concerns you may 
have.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER W. MARSHALL, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. ROGER W. MARSHALL"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas, Dr. Marshall, 
for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Marshall&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;Thank you, Chairman, very, very much.
Appreciate--thank you, Chairman, for the opportunity to come 
and talk and share some of my 30 years of experience as an OB/
Gyn in rural Kansas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;As most of the members of the committee know, 92 people die 
in this country every day. Ninety-two people die in this 
country every day from opioid addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;What I wanted to do was describe a couple sentinel events. 
Why? Why did we end up in this situation? And as I--as I look 
back in these last 10 years, the number of pills that I would 
send home for a post-op patient doubled.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;For the average C-section, the average hysterectomy, all of 
a sudden each week, to get the people to that post-op visit the 
number of pills they would need literally doubled.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;So I went back to try to figure out why and how come, and 
the first thing I think of, the Patient Bill of Rights came 
about 1993 or so, and over the next 10 years, though it was a 
great document, patients suddenly began to expect that they 
should have no pain--no pain after surgery. They would come 
into the ER with a sprained ankle and expect to have no pain 
and the demand for narcotics went up and up.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;Somewhere in the early 2000s, something was introduced 
called a pain scale and they called it the fifth vital sign. It 
is probably the worst thing I've ever seen introduced in my 
medical career where they suddenly described the amount of 
pain, which is very subjective, and beyond that it eventually 
became part of a measure of how good a medicine you were 
practising, even tied to your reimbursement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;So suddenly patients in the post-op PACU area were getting 
double and triple the medications, and then on the post-
operative floor, rather than getting Percocets every 6 hours, 
they were getting them every 4 hours and the PCA pumps 
increased doses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;So what I am trying to say is we almost doubled the amount 
of narcotics people were getting in the hospital and then they 
wanted twice the amount to go home with as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;So physicians were faced with this struggle of saying well, 
I don't think you need this much, but patients becoming more 
and more in control of how many--of their own health care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;So I think those are a couple of reasons why we ended up 
here and I think there needs to be some reeducation done. I 
would like to point towards Valley Hope at Norton, Kansas. They 
have treated over 300,000 patients over the past 50 years. They 
have kept incredible statistics. They have incredible treatment 
plans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;And what they taught me is about a month after release--a 
month after they started their Path to Recovery that they had a 
second physiological reaction and that is when they--these 
people OD and die. People need to recognize that for a month 
that they need to have very close treatment and probably for 
two months, then even a year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;So it's during that second episode when they--when before 
they had treatment they were taking a certain amount of heroin 
and a handful of pills and a pint of whiskey. When they 
retreated from that for a month and they went back to that same 
dose, they overdosed and stopped dying.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;We need to understand what kills people is that--that if I 
gave anybody enough morphine you would stop breathing. So they 
are unable to metabolize it. We need to recognize that that is 
a very critical moment. Treatment plans cannot last a week.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Marshall"&gt;They're going to last months and years probably. We need to 
make sure we are adequately funding outpatient treatment and 
that we are making sure that there is good follow-up at home 
and we need to reward facilities like Valley Hope who have 
great outcomes--great long-term outcomes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Roger W. Marshall&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for taking on this task and 
look forward to working with you, as always.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;As a practicing physician for nearly 3 decades, and now a 
freshman Congressman, I have had a unique perspective from 
which to understand the causes, and to identify solutions for 
the opioid crisis we face.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;Over the last decade, it has become clear that many actions 
taken by the medical community to better-address pain, such as 
pain-scales, and stronger pain treatments for chronic diseases 
or cancer, have helped fuel an opioid epidemic that is killing 
an unprecedented number of Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;While we began to improve the restrictions on prescribing 
these painkillers, tens of thousands of addicted people turned 
to street-level drugs as cheap, potent alternatives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;Today, I don't pretend to have all the answers or solutions 
to this complex situation, but there are some simple things 
already being done that have proven successful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;One part of the solution is quality community addiction 
treatment. For 50 years, Valley Hope in Norton, KS, has treated 
over 300,000 patients. They address substance-abuse as a 
chronic health care problem, just like you would treat 
hypertension or diabetes. They don't treat it as some sort of 
moral deficiency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;Valley Hope also recognizes that opioid addiction has a 
second withdrawal about a month after stopping the use of 
narcotics. It is that secondary withdrawal that patients are 
most likely to overdose. Patients go back to taking the amount 
of drugs they usually took to get high. Their bodies cannot 
metabolize like they used to, and the patient overdoses and 
stops breathing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;The key to avoiding these disasters is to maintain contact 
through weekly follow ups and outpatient checkups. The future 
treatment for opioid abuse will be found in rewarding good 
outpatient management, and institutions that pride themselves 
in low rates of readmission and relapse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;Solving this crisis begins in the doctor's office. 
Physicians, nurses and patients must all be willing to 
understand the potential for addiction when the prescribe, 
administer or take medications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Roger W. Marshall"&gt;    When we pair this understanding with capable community 
treatment, along with respect, compassion and empathy toward 
those suffering, we will have taken the first steps to overcome 
this challenge.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE STIVERS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF OHIO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. STEVE STIVERS"&gt;    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Chairman 
Stivers, for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Stivers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I
appreciate you holding this hearing. Appreciate Ranking Member 
Green and all of you looking at solutions that--for this opioid 
crisis that is plaguing all of the communities across this 
country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;Congressman Turner already alluded to it, but in Ohio 
opioid overdoses now exceed car accidents as the leading cause 
of death for most Ohioans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;And there have been a lot of great ideas presented here 
today and I really have appreciated learning from many of our 
colleagues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;I, for the last 5 years, have held opioid round tables--
drug round tables in my district to talk about solutions and we 
have come up with some ideas from the field of folks that know 
what is driving this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;And I will talk about some medical things in a second but 
the first thing I know we have to do is bring back hope and 
economic opportunity to people and I think what you are doing, 
Mr. Chairman, with regulatory reform and what we are doing with 
tax reform is going to help with that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;But there are a lot of other things we can do. First, you 
know, the idea that came out of our round table this year was 
on evidence-based treatment. If you've been to one treatment 
facility you have been to one treatment facility, because they 
all do things differently.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;Too many of them do things that when you walk out that 
door, there is nothing tying you to the treatment anymore and 
that is a problem, and they need to--I think we should have 
evidence-based treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;It should be based on the science of the day and how 
recovery works, and I think we need to build that into our 
reimbursement standards. I think that is so important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;Dr. Marshall already talked about the second issue I want 
to bring up, which is pain as a vital sign. Every other vital 
sign you can think of--you know, your temperature, your blood 
pressure, your pulse--can be measured by a machine. Pain can't 
be measured by a machine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;It is a subjective number and it should not be the fifth 
vital sign. It has led to our over prescribing culture in this 
country and we have to try to fix it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;I appreciate what CMS has done to remove the reimbursement 
based on the surveys of pain management. But I think we need to 
remove pain as a vital sign.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;The third idea is encouraging alternatives. There is lots 
of ways to manage pain including acupuncture, chiropractic 
services, and other things that don't involve a pill and I 
think we need to change the culture on that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;The fourth idea is some prescription changes and I know 
that Buddy Carter, who is a pharmacist, talked about a couple 
of these. I sponsored the partial fill legislation that was 
rolled into CARA and became law. But I believe that pharmacists 
should be empowered to authorize partial fill of opioid 
prescriptions on their own.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;And Buddy already said it, but 70 percent of the folks who 
misuse prescriptions get it at some point--bridge that 
addiction through their friends' and families' medicine 
cabinets and we have got to fix that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;The final issue that I don't hear talked about enough is 
tapering doses. When somebody is on an opioid for about 30 
days, they have a physical addiction to it and if you talk to 
most pharmacists they will talk about a tapering does instead 
of going off cold turkey, and I think that is something we need 
to bring a culture around of having folks understand that 
because a lot of primary care physicians, Mr. Chairman, feel 
very uncomfortable with doing--issuing more prescriptions but a 
tapering does actually will reduce the physical addiction and 
actually will result in less people wanting to feed that 
addiction in other ways.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Stivers"&gt;So those are just five ideas of some proposed solutions. 
Many of my colleagues also have great ideas. I really 
appreciate, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, you holding this 
hearing and we are committed to working with you to driving 
this scourge of drug addiction out of this country, and I 
really appreciate what you are doing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Steve Stivers&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Thank you Chairman Burgess and Ranking Member Green for 
having this hearing today to discuss solutions for addressing 
the opioid crisis plaguing communities across America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;We have seen drug overdoses surpass traffic accidents as 
the leading cause of accidental death in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;This issue affects everyone--no matter your race, income 
level, gender, or political party. We need to work together to 
curb this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;My District&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Ohio has been devastated by this crisis. In 2016, 4,050 
Ohioans died from an unintentional drug overdose. This was a 
32.8 Percent increase from 2015 (3,050).&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;In my district alone, there were 112 overdose deaths in 
2015, according to the Ohio High Intensity Drug Trafficking 
Area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Because of how much this has affected my district, I have 
held roundtables for the past 5 years to bring together people 
from all sides of the issue to discuss how we can better work 
together to address this issue in Ohio.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Evidence-Based Treatment&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;In one of my recent roundtables, we discussed how we need 
to ensure that we support only the treatments that are proven 
to work and are evidence-based.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Based on these discussions, we have learned of a serious 
need to raise the evidenced based standards that are used in 
approving treatment programs that are largely funded by the 
Federal Government and administered at the local level.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;The Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services 
estimates that almost 500,000 Ohioans receive publicly funded 
mental health services, which includes addiction treatment, 
every year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Whether it be a discrepancy between accreditation 
standards, or inadequate reporting requirements, Congress 
should be ensuring that Federal funds going to Ohio, and to my 
district, are going towards treatments that are based on a 
foundation of evidence as to its efficacy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Simultaneously, we need to promote data collection and 
research in order to better inform our evidence-based efforts 
over time, so that we do not discourage emergent therapies and 
can justify deploying innovative approaches that can meet this 
epidemic head on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Pain as a Vital Sign&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Another issue we discussed is removing pain as the fifth 
vital sign and finding ways to change the culture surrounding 
pain management and the overprescription of opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Pain being considered a vital sign can, in some cases, lead 
to the overprescribing of opioids by focusing on pain 
management instead addressing and treating the underlying 
causes of pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;This culture of overprescribing has also been found in 
patient-reported satisfaction scores. On these surveys, ``pain 
management'' is a section doctors and hospitals have been 
scored on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Poor marks in satisfaction scores can lead to lower 
reimbursements for these doctors and hospitals, and this 
attempt to manage pain, while well intentioned, created a 
perverse incentive that led to some health care professionals 
to work towards a score, rather than the best overall health of 
the patient.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Recently, CMS has announced that they will no longer be 
directly tying these ``pain management'' questions to the 
Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, starting next year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;I am encouraged by CMS's recent actions. By building upon 
these actions and working to remove the use of pain as a vital 
sign, we can remove the incentive to overprescribe opioids to 
patients, and rather focus on prescribing them when they are 
absolutely necessary. I implore the committee to learn from 
this example to ensure further policies are always focused on 
the long term health of the patient over short term benchmarks 
and quotas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Encouraging Alternatives&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;As we seek to change the culture of pain management, we 
also need to find ways to support and bolster alternative 
methods for treating and managing pain--outside of opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;This can include treatment options such as chiropractic 
services and acupuncture.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;There is no doubt that we should ensure patients can 
receive the medicine they need, but overreliance as a quick and 
easy fix must be discouraged when there are other alternatives 
that could be used.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Tapering Opioid Use&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Furthermore, as you know, last year, the passage of the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) was one of the 
highlights in the fight against opiate addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Language from my legislation, the Reducing Unused 
Medications Act was included in the final passage of CARA. This 
bill allows for the partial fill of prescriptions at the 
request of patients or doctors, reducing the number of unused 
painkillers that can be abused or diverted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;With more than 70 percent of adults who misuse prescription 
opioids getting them from medicine cabinets of friends or 
relatives, we needed to reduce unused medications in homes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Now, we need build on that legislation. One way to do that 
is to focus on supporting better education and protocols for 
physicians to taper down the dosages of prescribed opioids over 
the course of treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;This approach must be specific to each patient, and we 
should be finding ways to encourage better conversations about 
pain management between patients, their doctors, and their 
pharmacists.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;I look forward to working with this committee to find 
better ways to better inform patients of resources and tools at 
their disposal--like partial fill opportunities--and giving 
physicians more freedom to address pain management at an 
individual level.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Closing&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;There is no single legislative fix for the opioid epidemic. 
We need to keep pushing to find ways to better prevent opioid 
abuse and treat those who are suffering from addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;Those are just a few of the proposed solutions I am 
advocating, and I hope I can continue working with everyone on 
this committee to craft legislation that delivers relief to 
Ohio's 15th District and all communities suffering from this 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Hon. Steve Stivers"&gt;    Again, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for 
having this important hearing. I lookforward to working with 
everyone on solutions to stop the opioid epidemic in our 
country.

&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Schneider&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Burgess,
Ranking Member Green, for inviting me here today to discuss the 
epidemic of opioid addiction abuse and overdose that is 
ravaging our communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;I represent the people of Illinois' 10th District including 
parts of Cook and Lake Counties, and the opioid crisis has hit 
our neighbourhoods extremely hard.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;In Cook County, which includes the city of Chicago, opioid 
overdoses increased by 87.4 percent--I repeat that, 87.4 
percent--between 2013 and 2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;Over the same period, we witnessed a troubling increase in 
fentanyl, a synthetic opioid which is even more deadly than 
heroin and whose overdoses are often fatal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;In the face of these challenges, I would like to recognize 
the Lake County Opioid Initiative and Chicago area Opioid Task 
Force along with other area organizations for their work to 
prevent opioid abuse, addiction, overdose, and health--and 
death, rather.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;In this epidemic, our adversary is constantly shifting. So 
must ensure our doctors are up to date with the most recent 
best practices and research for preventing and treating this 
disease.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;Earlier this year, I introduced a bill called the 
Preventing Opioid Abuse Through Continuing Education, or Opioid 
PACE Act. This bill would require providers who treat patients 
will prescription opioids for pain management to complete 12 
hours of continuing education every 3 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;This would be linked to renewal of the providers' Drug 
Enforcement Agency license. In an effort to cut down on over 
prescribing, the CME would focus on pain management treatment 
guidelines and best practices, early detection of opioid use 
disorder, and the treatment and management of patients with 
opioid use disorder.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;I am proud that a modified version of this bill requiring 
continuing education of medical professionals at the Department 
of Defense was included as an amendment to the NDA 
authorization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;Our men and women in uniform are not immune from the 
damages of opioid addiction. In fact, the National Institute of 
Health reports rates of prescription opioid misuse are higher 
among service members than among civilians due to the use of 
these drugs to treat symptoms of PTSD and chronic pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;As we seek new legislative solutions, I urge my colleagues 
to support these programs we have in place to fight back. In 
particular, the Affordable Care Act greatly increased our 
ability to counter opioid epidemic by expanding Medicaid and 
requiring individual market policies that they would cover 
services related to treating substance use disorders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;The States with the highest rates of drug overdose deaths 
are also the States that would suffer from a rollback of 
Medicaid expansion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Schneider"&gt;Simply put, repealing the ACA would add fuel to the fire of 
the opioid epidemic. I urge my colleagues to consider new 
solutions to address this crisis including the Opioid PACE Act 
and preserve the programs we have in place to address this 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Bradley Scott Schneider"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess and Ranking Member Green, for 
inviting me here today to discuss the epidemic of opioid 
addiction, abuse, and overdose that is ravaging our 
communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Bradley Scott Schneider"&gt;I represent the people of Illinois' 10th District including 
parts of Cook and Lake Counties, and the opioid crisis has hit 
our neighborhoods hard. In 2015, there were 42 heroin-related 
deaths in Lake County, a seven-percent increase over the 
previous year. In Cook County, which includes the City of 
Chicago, opioid overdoses increased by 87.4 percent between 
2013 and 2016. Over the same period, we've witnessed a 
troubling increase in fentanyl--a synthetic opioid which is 
even more deadly than heroin and whose overdoses are often 
fatal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Bradley Scott Schneider"&gt;In the face of these challenges, I'd like to recognize the 
Lake County Opioid Initiative and Chicago Area Opioid Task

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. HAKEEM S. JEFFRIES, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. HAKEEM S. JEFFRIES"&gt;    Chair recognizes Representative Jeffries from New York for 
3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jeffries&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess and Ranking
Member Green, for holding this hearing as well as for your 
leadership on this very important issue. Appreciate the 
opportunity to testify today on the Synthetic Drug Awareness 
Act of 2017--H.R. 449.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;The opioid crisis has ravaged families across the country 
without regard to zip code, income, race, religion, or gender. 
Like a malignant tumor, the opioid crisis is eating away at 
young people in urban American, rural America, as well as 
suburban America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;One reason the opioid abuse has become so prevalent and so 
deadly is the emergence of the synthetic drug called fentanyl, 
a substance that can be 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;In order to address the multifaceted public health crisis 
we confront, it's important to consider both the cause and 
effect. H.R. 449 addresses a critical and sometimes overlooked 
threat--the use of synthetic drugs by teenagers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;It requires the surgeon general to prepare a comprehensive 
report on the public health effects of synthetic drug abuse by 
12-to-18-year-olds in America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;With the information the study will provide, Congress can 
work to prevent substance abuse by younger Americans through an 
enhanced and enlightened lens. Nationwide, the drug overdose 
death rate has more than doubled during the past decade among 
younger Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;Many experts believe this troubling phenomenon results from 
the rise and availability of potent and dangerous substances 
like illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;Teenage fentanyl use is a vicious cycle. Adolescents have a 
still developing prefrontal cortex which can facilitate drug-
seeking behavior. The drug then alters the development of this 
area of the young brain, making that behavior permanent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;In fact, more than 90 percent of adults who develop a 
substance abuse disorder begin using prior to the age of 18. In 
New York City, overdoses now kill more people each year than 
murder, suicides, and car crashes combined. This phenomenon we 
have seen repeated over and over again all across America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Jeffries"&gt;This bill has significant support amongst Republicans and 
Democrats and has been incorporated into the legislative agenda 
for the bipartisan Heroin Task Force. It also has support from 
a number of health and patient advocacy groups including the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association of Nurse 
Practitioners, as well as the National Association of Police 
Organizations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. EVAN H. JENKINS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. EVAN H. JENKINS"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia, Mr. 
Jenkins, for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Thank you so much, Chairman Burgess, Ranking
Member Green, and members of the subcommittee for giving me the 
opportunity to discuss this most challenging public health and 
safety issue of our time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;My home State of West Virginia is ground zero for the 
opioid epidemic. West Virginia has the Nation's highest 
overdose rate and the highest rate of newborns exposed to 
opioids and other drugs known as neonatal abstinence syndrome, 
or NAS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;From this tragic epidemic, however, has come an exceptional 
response from communities across my State coming together to 
find solutions. One shining example is Lilly's Place, a unique 
facility that specializes in treating newborns suffering from&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;I was proud to work with two NICU nurses and a passionate 
community leader to start Lilly's Place after they saw, we saw, 
the dramatic rise in newborns with NAS. Lilly's Place has been 
operating for 3 years and has cared for more than 190 precious 
newborns.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Lilly's Place has brought national attention to West 
Virginia solutions. Just yesterday, the First Lady, Melania 
Trump, visited Lilly's Place in my hometown of Huntington to 
talk with the caregivers about helping the most vulnerable in 
our society. Lilly's Place provides a great environment with 
are given by doctors and nurses in a nurturing setting 
conducive to recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Mothers and families are included in the healing process. 
Lilly's Place and others advocating for this model of care had 
struggles dealing with CMS, making it harder to replicate this 
model.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;That led to my introduction of the Nurturing and Supporting 
Healthy Babies Act. Last year through this committee's work my 
legislation was incorporated in CARA, which, of course, became 
law and was passed. Thank you for your work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;My legislation requiring GAO to closely look at the 
different care models for NAS and Medicaid coverage and the GAO 
report was just released last week.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;It found that nonhospital settings like Lilly's Place are a 
proven model of care to treat NAS newborns. It identified this 
model of care as a proven effective treatment approach and can 
actually reduce the cost of care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Here is my ask. I would encourage this committee to advance 
two measures critical to the care of these precious newborns. 
First, I have sponsored the CRIB Act pending before this 
committee with Congressman Mike Turner which makes sure these 
models of care are included in nonhospital treatment facilities 
are recognized by Medicaid to remove the barriers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Second, based on the GAO report, I ask you, working with 
me--this committee--to memorialize in legislation the 
recommendations in this report and have these become law so 
these precious newborns can receive the very best possible 
care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Evan H. Jenkins&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your interest in this issue, 
and I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and 
members of the subcommittee, for giving me the opportunity to 
discuss the most challenging public health crisis of our time. 
States and communities across this country have been dealing 
with the ravages of opioid and drug addiction. This is not a 
rural or urban problem, it is a crisis that has hit cities and 
small towns alike.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;West Virginia has been ground zero for the opioid epidemic. 
The statistics speak for themselves. West Virginia has the 
highest overdose death rate, we have the highest rate of 
newborns exposed to opioids and other drugs known as Neonatal 
Abstinence Syndrome or NAS, and the lowest workforce 
participation rate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;But from this tragic epidemic has come an exceptional 
response from communities across my home State. Communities 
have come together to find solutions and they are working to 
get their communities healthy again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;One of the most shining examples is Lily's Place, a unique 
stand-alone facility that specializes in treating newborns 
suffering from NAS in a clinically appropriate setting. I was 
proud to have worked with two NICU nurses to start Lily's Place 
after they had seen a dramatic rise in newborns with NAS at the 
local hospital.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;Lily's Place has brought national attention to West 
Virginia solutions, being featured in a number of news stories. 
Just yesterday, First Lady, Melania Trump, visited Lily's Place 
in West Virginia to talk with caregivers helping the most 
vulnerable in our society, newborns suffering from NAS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;Lily's Place provides a perfect environment for newborns 
suffering from NAS, with a low lit, low stimulus environment 
with doctors and nurses providing care. Lily's Place has become 
a model for its ability to treat newborns, and Lily's Place 
includes the mothers and families in the healing process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;Last year, with the tireless work of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, Congress passed and the President signed 
the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act or CARA. I was 
honored to have my legislation, the Nurturing and Supporting 
Healthy Babies Act included in the package of bills. This 
legislation required the GAO to take a close look at the 
different care models for NAS and how NAS is covered by 
Medicaid. I thank the members of this committee for working 
with me to further our understanding of how best to take care 
of newborns with NAS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;The GAO report released last week, had important 
information and a number of key findings in it. Part of what we 
have learned from the GAO report is that nonhospital settings 
are sometimes a better alternative to the NICU for the care 
that NAS newborns need. The report identified and took a close 
look at different care models and how the best practices at 
nonhospital settings can actually reduce costs of care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;I have sponsored legislation, the CRIB Act, with 
Congressman Mike Turner which makes sure that these nonhospital 
settings are recognized by Medicaid to remove this barrier to 
care for NAS newborns. This legislation would clear the 
confusion at CMS on how to certify these facilities and as to 
what a nonhospital NAS treatment center is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;The GAO report also highlighted that the Department of 
Health and Human Services has a number of recommendations they 
developed but HHS does not have a clear strategy or timeline 
for implementing these recommendations. I am working on 
legislation to make sure HHS develops a clear timeline and 
begins implementing a number of these recommendations. This 
legislation will give the needed push to HHS so we can help the 
newborns that are most impacted by the opioid epidemic start 
their lives happy and healthy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;We have a unique opportunity to continue the strong 
bipartisan work on addressing the opioid epidemic and these two 
pieces of legislation can continue this effort. I look forward 
to working with the committee to bring these two pieces of 
legislation to the House floor and send them to the President's 
desk.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Evan H. Jenkins"&gt;    Caring for the most vulnerable impacted by the opioid 
crisis is a truly noble cause and one that we can all come 
together to support.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP"&gt;    Dr. Wenstrup, you are recognized for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Wenstrup&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;Well, thank you, Chairman Burgess and Ranking
Member Green, for hosting this today, and I mean that 
sincerely. We are hearing a lot of good ideas and it gives us a 
lot of food for thought.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;But the opioid crisis is affecting each and every one of 
our districts across the country. That is very obvious, and I 
appreciate the chance to come and speak today and share with 
you some stories from Ohio's 2nd District.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;My office recently sent a survey to the constituents of our 
district and we asked them to share their stories and 
experiences with the opioid epidemic, and the results are 
heartbreaking, as you might imagine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;We received hundreds of responses--up to seven pages of 
responses, and I just want to share a couple of those with you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;One said, ``My brother, unfortunately, became addicted as a 
teenager. He is very lucky, because at 33 years old he's still 
here but he is still fighting every day to stay sober. These 
drugs have no place in our country. They are ruining our youth, 
our future.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;Another one--a woman said, ``I have four boys and three of 
them are struggling with this addiction. The cost of going to a 
methadone clinic is very difficult. The cost of treatment 
facilities is too expensive. I am going broke trying to get my 
children sober.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;Clearly, this epidemic is devastating for southern Ohio as 
it is across the country. In one county alone, the overdose 
death rate was 37.5 per 100,000 residents and in another county 
318 residents died of an intentional drug overdose in just--in 
2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;This spring, the Columbus Dispatch reported at least 4,149 
Ohioans died from an unintentional drug overdose in 2016 and 
one local newspaper called the overdoses the new normal in that 
county.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;I appreciate what Dr. Marshall had to say earlier. As a 
doctor, I can agree with him on many of the factors that have 
driven so many people into addiction, and I would really like 
for us to talk sometime about prevention, which I think is the 
long-term vision for our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;I can tell you as a doctor I had someone come up to me just 
last year and say, ``My friend wanted me to thank you if I met 
you,'' and I said, ``Why is that?`` He said, ``Because she was 
addicted to prescription pain meds, and when she came to you, 
you gave her alternatives, and you didn't give her any.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;We search for answers. We are all searching for answers. 
One of the sheriffs in my district, he's working hard on the 
solution and he's using prevention because he said, I can't 
incarcerate our way out of this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;But he did show me what one patient received on Medicaid in 
a year--what one patient in one year received from Medicaid as 
far as narcotics, and I promise you it was more than I 
prescribed in my entire surgical practice in a year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;And then he showed me what Medicaid paid for it. And so 
while I understand that Medicaid is providing help and care for 
a lot of people, it may be driving the problem as well, because 
as some are getting treatment, many are getting fed and the 
problem is being exacerbated and we need to look at that and 
there needs to be better oversight of how we are handling this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;This sheriff directs an essay contest, asking local 
students to write an essay about the dangers of opioids and how 
they hope to become the generation to stop the epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Wenstrup"&gt;As I said before, he said he can't incarcerate his way out 
of this. We can't always treat our way out of this. But I hope 
that we take some time in this process for a long-term vision 
of how we can prevent people from ever getting in this 
situation to begin with.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;And with that, I yield back, and I thank you for your time 
and attention today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;Thank you, Health Subcommittee Chairman Burgess and Health 
Subcommittee Ranking Member Green, for hosting this Member Day 
today. The opioid crisis is affecting each and every one of our 
districts across the country, so I appreciate the opportunity 
to come and speak to you today, along with my colleagues, and 
share with you some stories from Ohio's 2nd District.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;My office recently sent a survey to the constituents of 
Ohio's 2nd District, asking them to share their stories and 
experiences with the opioid epidemic. The results are 
heartbreaking. We received hundreds of responses--all telling 
the same stories. I wanted to just read aloud a few of them for 
you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;One woman wrote, ``My brother unfortunately became addicted 
as a teenager. He is a very lucky one at 33 years old he is 
still fighting every day to stay sober. These drugs have no 
place in our country. They are ruining our youth, our future.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;Another said, ``My daughter is currently in rehab for 
heroin addiction; she's destroyed several relationships with 
various members of our family, I am raising her 18-month-old 
son and she's been in and out of jail for several years and 
she's only 27. She's overdosed at least once that I know about 
and has been physically and emotionally abused by a boyfriend. 
I am terrified that she won't live to see 30 and that her son 
will never know the sweet and caring person she was/is when not 
high.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;Another constituent shared, ``I have 4 boys and 3 of them 
are struggling with this addiction.the cost of going to a 
methadone clinic is very difficult.the cost of treatment 
facilities is too expensive.I am going broke trying to get my 
children sober.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;Clearly, this epidemic is devastating for Southern Ohio, as 
it is across the country. In one county in Ohio alone, the 
overdose death rate was 37.5 per 100,000 residents. In another 
county, 318 residents died of an unintentional drug overdose in 
2016. This spring, the Columbus Dispatch reported that at least 
4,149 Ohioans died from unintentional drug overdoses in 2016. 
One local newspaper called the overdoses the ``new normal'' in 
that county.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;As we search for solutions to this crisis, I hope you'll 
keep this in mind: Adams County Sheriff Kimmy Rogers, in my 
district, is working hard on a key part of this solution: 
prevention. He runs an after-school program at a local church 
that teaches young kids about the dangers of drugs and opioids. 
He also runs an essay contest, asking local students to write 
an essay about the dangers of opioids and how they hope to 
become the generation to stop the epidemic. When I asked 
Sherriff Rogers about these programs, he said we can't 
incarcerate our way out of this problem. We can't always treat 
our way out of this. But I hope we take some time in this 
process for a long-term vision of how we can prevent people 
from every getting in this situation to begin with.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;With that, I yield back, and I thank you for your time and 
attention today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Brad R. Wenstrup"&gt;Mr. Green [presiding]. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. KATHERINE M. CLARK, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. KATHERINE M. CLARK"&gt;    The Chair, in absence, is recognizing Congresswoman Clark.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clark&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;Thank you, Ranking Member Green, and thank you
to you and to Chairman Burgess for holding this Member Day 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;We are all here because we lose 91 Americans a day to the 
opioid epidemic and every one of those 91 deaths affects not 
only the victim but also their loved ones, their workplace, and 
their community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;Now is the time for us to come together and find solutions 
to end this national health emergency. And with that in mind, I 
would like to speak in favor of four common sense proposals 
that I am leading, each with a great Republican partner, aimed 
at addressing a different aspect of the opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;The first is the Youth Act, which I introduced with my 
colleague from Indiana, Dr. Bucshon. The opioid epidemic has 
had a tragic impact on our young people. From harmful changes 
in brain and social development to long gaps in education and 
job training, the effects can be profound.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;The Youth Act would expand access to evidence-based 
medication-assisted treatment for adolescents and young adults, 
giving them the best possible chance at recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;The second proposal is the Prescriber Support Act, which I 
introduced with my colleague, Congressman Evan Jenkins. 
Tragically, opioid addiction often begins in the doctor's 
office where patients are often prescribed more medication than 
they need or without being informed about the risks of 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;The Prescriber Support Act would establish State-based 
resources for prescribers to consult when making decisions 
about prescribing opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;Third, I recently the Every Prescription Conveyed Securely 
Act with my colleague from Oklahoma, Congressman Mullin. This 
proposal would ensure that all prescriptions for controlled 
substances filled through Medicare Part D would be transmitted 
electronically.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;Electronic transmission would help doctors and pharmacists 
spot patients attempting to doctor shop and it would make 
more--make it more difficult to forge a prescription, all the 
while saving taxpayer dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;Finally, I will soon be introducing a bill with my 
colleague from Kentucky, Congressman Hal Rogers, that will 
create a student loan forgiveness program for professionals who 
enter and stay in the substance use treatment field.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;In my district, I have heard time and time again from 
families and providers that there simply aren't enough 
treatment specialists available to help the growing number of 
Americans struggling with substance use disorder.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;Our bill will help build this critical work force. There is 
no single solution to the opioid crisis. However, these four 
bipartisan solutions can help put us on a path to beating this 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Clark"&gt;I thank the chairman and the ranking member for giving us 
this opportunity to have this conversation, and I look forward 
to working together.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Katherine M. Clark"&gt;The opioid epidemic claims the lives of 91 Americans a day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY"&gt;    The gentlelady from Connecticut, Ms. Esty, is recognized 
for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Esty&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman--Chairman Burgess and
Ranking Member Green. Thank you so much for holding this 
important hearing on the growing opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;Everywhere I go in Connecticut, I meet people whose 
families have lost loved ones to drug addiction--moms and dads, 
sons and daughters, brothers and sisters. It is an epidemic 
that affects families and communities across the country 
regardless of age, race, gender, socioeconomic status.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;During one of my visits recently to Staywell Oasis--it's an 
addiction treatment center in Waterbury--I met a young woman 
who has been struggling on the streets with addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;She has a new child and she is so grateful to be in a 
program that is allowing her to stay clean and helping her keep 
her child.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;I met a 45-year-old man in the Farrell Treatment Center in 
New Britain who for 20 years has been battling his addiction 
and is finally coming to terms with it and able to hold a 
steady job.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;These are real people, real families, and real lives that 
are affected by this crisis, and the stakes are high. If these 
vital treatment centers are forced to close their doors or if 
we limit access to them, people will die.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;In my home town of Cheshire, a neighbor whose daughter was 
a classmate of one of my children contacted the office. They 
had lost track of their daughter.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;She had been on the streets, addicted to drugs. We were 
able to help them find her. She wouldn't accept the treatment, 
and a week later she was dead.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;That's what it's like now in America. The situation is so 
dire in Connecticut that our chief medical examiner lost its 
accreditation. They cannot keep up with the autopsies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;We are expecting more than a thousand deaths this year. 
That is the third-highest rate in the country. They literally 
cannot keep up with the autopsies. We need to do something and 
this Congress needs to act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;I am pleased at our good bipartisan work last year. My bill 
of the Prevent Drug Addiction Act of 2016 was included as part 
of the conference committee in our good bipartisan work to 
ensure that we are addressing the issues of prevention with 
many of my colleagues have addressed here today--both provider 
education on how to prescribe as well as for parents, coaches, 
and others who need to be aware of the risks of prescription 
drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;But there is important--there is important work at stake 
and I do want to say something about the Affordable Care Act. 
We need to protect the funding, which is providing vital access 
for people across America, and we are real risk now as we 
consider that funding and whether the Medicaid access will be 
cut off, which is funding so many of the important programs in 
my State.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Esty"&gt;So again, I want to thank this committee for the good work 
and encourage all of our members to come together and help 
address this vital need--this growing epidemic that is 
affecting all Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;Mr. Chair, thank you for holding this hearing on the 
growing opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;This epidemic is literally filling the morgues across our 
country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;Everywhere I go in Connecticut, I meet people whose 
families have lost loved ones to drug addiction--moms and dads, 
sons and daughters, brothers and sisters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;It's an epidemic that affects families and communities 
across the country--regardless of age, sex, race, or socio-
economic status.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;During one of my recent visits to Staywell Oasis, an 
addiction treatment center in Waterbury, I met a young woman 
who has a new baby and is so grateful for the help that the 
program is providing for her.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;She emphasized to me how important Staywell is for her--
that the it is is keeping her clean and off the streets so that 
she can keep her baby.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;Or there's the 45-year-old man that I met at Farrell 
Treatment Center in New Britain who is getting his 20-year 
battle with opioids under control for the first time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;These are real people, real families, and real lives that 
are affected by the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;And the stakes are high.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;If these vital treatment centers are forced to close their 
doors, or if we limit access to them, people will die.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;In my hometown of Cheshire, one of my neighbors came to my 
office pleading for help--they could not find their daughter.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;Their daughter had been battling substance addiction for 
years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;The family did ultimately find their daughter, but it was 
too late.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;She died weeks later without the care and treatment she so 
desperately needed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;This is how dire the situation is: In our State, the Office 
of the Chief Medical Examiner actually lost its accreditation 
because it simply could not keep up with the body count, due to 
the sharp rise of drug overdose deaths in Connecticut.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;Connecticut's Chief Medical Examiner projected that 
Connecticut will hit a devastating benchmark this year: More 
than 1,000 people will die from opioid overdoses in our State 
alone before the end of the year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;The medical examiner's office simply cannot keep up with 
the demand for autopsies on the rising number of people who are 
dying from drug overdoses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;Congress needs to act, and it needs to act now, to save 
lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;Instead of finding ways to hire more medical examiners to 
keep up with the rocketing death toll, Congress needs to work 
together to come up with commonsense solutions to end this 
devastating epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;Last year, I was proud to help write a landmark, bipartisan 
bill to improve resources for cities and towns to address this 
crisis and to create new consumer and provider education 
campaigns to encourage prevention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;The funding in this bill was not everything our communities 
need--but it was an important step forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;The State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis Grant 
program, created by the 21st Century Cures Act, provided $1 
billion over the next 2 years to States to address the opioid 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;These grants help support programs for people struggling 
with addiction at places like the Farrell Treatment Center in 
New Britain, the Staywell Oasis Addiction Treatment Center in 
Waterbury, or the McCall Center for Behavioral Health in 
Torrington, provide life-lines to people struggling with 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;At the same time, we must ensure that the millions of 
Americans with substance use disorders who currently get 
treatment through Medicaid expansion are able to continue to 
get the care they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;The recent, misguided efforts to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act and defund Medicaid expansion would have cut over $800 
billion from the Medicaid program, removing access to treatment 
for low-income people with mental and substance use disorders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;I am heartened that you have invited me here today to talk 
about how this devastating epidemic is affecting my district, 
and I am committed to continuing to partner with my colleagues 
in Congress to prevent more lives from being taken by the 
opioid epidemic and to help those suffering from addiction to 
recover and move forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Hon. Elizabeth H. Esty"&gt;    Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. MIA B. LOVE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF UTAH&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;The Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Utah, Mrs. Love, 
for 3 minutes, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;Mrs. Love. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for such--talking about 
such an issue, and I would like to thank the Ranking Member 
Green also for giving us the opportunity to speak about the 
opioid epidemic and crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;Nationwide, the rate of deaths has exploded to over--over 
the last 10 years to now more than 60,000 deaths every year. In 
Utah, the Department of Health says that more people are dying 
from opioid and heroin overdose than ever before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;Six people die from opioid overdose per year. Alarming 
increases from 2013 to 2015. Utah is seventh-highest for those 
deaths per capita in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;Here is what hits me the hardest is the innocent children 
that are being affected by the opioid epidemic. In too many 
cases, parents are no longer parents. Their children are 
parenting themselves and the parents are now slaves to their 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;This is actually happening in Elk Ridge, Utah, a place 
where--which is just a few minutes away from my home. There is 
a boy who is in 3rd grade who talks about his life with his 
mom, who is addicted, and his stepfather, who is addicted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;He talks about waking up by himself and getting himself 
ready for school and also getting his brother ready for school 
and his newborn sister. He makes breakfast for them and 
prepares a bottle for his newborn baby, who is his sister.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;He talks about the fact that many times he misses the bus 
when he's going to school because he is taking care of his 
brother and sister and there is no one to take him to school.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;His brother cries, asking for his mom and dad, and he, as a 
3-year-old has to try to explain to his brother why Mom and Dad 
aren't around.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;That's not the end of his story. His newborn sister is 
actually addicted to opioids because his mother took the drugs 
while she was pregnant, and while in the hospital, for fear of 
getting caught, she actually took opioids and would rub it on 
the gums of her baby so that the baby wouldn't show signs of 
withdrawal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;This is what is happening in America. This story is not 
unique to Utah. It is happening everywhere. The parents are now 
in jail. They were arrested for trying to return stolen 
merchandise at the local Wal-Mart and neglect of their 
children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;But I have to say that the children's lives aren't better 
now without mom and dad. Their nightmare is just beginning. So 
I feel very strongly about this. At a time where there is so 
much partisan politics, this is an issue where so many of us 
are standing together.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;I believe that American democracy is at its best when two 
people are in a room and talk about what they are for, and here 
we are, in a room talking about what we are for.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="HON. MIA B. LOVE"&gt;I am so proud that we are actually coming together, but 
coming together is not enough. We actually have to apply some 
of these solutions that we are talking about when it comes to 
the crisis, and I think the opportunity to--I am thankful for 
the opportunity to work on this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Mia B. Love&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;Thank you, and I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this epidemic of 
the Opioid Crisis, and I appreciate the efforts of everyone 
here. To fight this public health crisis, we must work 
together. I pledge to do whatever I can to assist in that 
effort, because Utah is being hit especially hard by opioid 
abuse and death.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;I am humbled by the raw fact and statistics regarding this 
in my State:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Utah Department of Health says that 24 
individuals die from prescription opioid overdoses every month 
in Utah. A growing number of people are dying from heroin 
overdoses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The rate of these deaths has exploded over the 
last 10 years. I would say it's out of control. The National 
institute on Drug Abuse reports that there are more than 60,000 
death per in year in our country from prescription and heroin 
use. Utah is in the top five for those types of death per 
capita.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;I don't like to see anyone suffer and die from the 
miserable cycle of drug dependency and abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;And here's what hits me the hardest: Innocent children are 
being affected by this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;In too many cases, parents are no longer parents, they're 
drug addicts. Their children are doing the parenting 
themselves, and for their brothers and sisters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;I recently learned of a case in Elk Ridge, Utah, which is 
just minutes from my home.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;There, a boy in the 3rd grade told the story of life with 
his mom and stepdad: Waking up by himself, making breakfast and 
dinner for his 2-year-old brother and newborn sister. About 
missing the bus, with no one to take him to school. Of his 
brother crying because his mom and dad weren't there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;Mom and Dad were on heroin: That's why they weren't there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;And that's not the end of the story.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;That boy's sister--the newborn baby--was born addicted to 
opioids, because her mother was using while she was pregnant. 
After she was born, to hide the baby's withdrawal symptoms from 
the hospital staff, the parents rubbed crushed opioids on the 
child's gums.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;The parents are now in jail-arrested trying to return 
stolen merchandise for money at the local Wal-Mart. And for 
child abuse and neglect.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;Those kids are just an example of the toll this epidemic is 
taking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;But there are those in my State that are taking steps to 
deal with it. Utah's Intermountain Healthcare has set a goal to 
reduce opioid prescribing by 40 per cent in its 22 hospitals 
and 180 clinics by the end of next year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;I applaud this effort, but it's obviously just one piece of 
a larger puzzle.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Mia B. Love"&gt;    We need to put those pieces together for our children, for 
ourselves, and for the future of the United States of America.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR., A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. BILL PASCRELL"&gt;    Let me take the New Jersey delegation in seniority, and, 
Mr. Pascrell, I will go to you first for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pascrell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member
Green.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;I don't have to tell you or anyone here that opiate abuse 
and misuse is one of our country's fastest growing problems. It 
is also one of the most vexing problems we face and there are 
no simple solutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;Prescription drugs serve a valid medical purpose. But many 
of them carry high risk of addiction and abuse. Many of my 
colleagues have good ideas about steps we can take to address 
opiate abuse and misuse. So I commend you for giving us the 
opportunity to share them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;Today, I would like to share some information about a 
program that was developed and is in use at my hometown 
hospital, St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson, New 
Jersey.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;As the busiest emergency department in the State of New 
Jersey, St. Joe's commitment to reducing abuse can serve, I 
believe, as a model for emergency departments across the State 
an across the country. We need to recognize that emergency 
departments are in a unique position with respect to 
prescription drug abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;On one hand, a component of many of their patients' 
treatment involves acute pain that legitimately needs to be 
addressed. But emergency departments, because of the short-term 
nature of the care they provide, are also more susceptible to 
doctor shopping than many other health settings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;To prevent addiction, where it often starts with a valid 
prescription in the emergency room, St. Jo's initiated a first-
of-its-kind Alternatives to Opioids, or ALTO--ALTO program, the 
Alternatives to Opiates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;This new approach utilizes protocols primarily targeting 
five common conditions. The alternative therapies offered 
through St. Jo's ALTO program include targeted nonopiate 
medications, trigger point injections, nitrous oxide, 
ultrasound-guided nerve blocks to tailor patient pain 
management needs, and avoid opiates whenever possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;In the first year of operations, this program decreased 
emergency department opiate prescriptions by more then 50 
percent. The goal is not to eliminate opiates altogether 
because these drugs remain an important part of pain 
management.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;However, the ALTO program reserves their use for severe 
pain, end-of-life pain, surgical conditions. That's it. As a 
result, only about 25 percent of the acute pain patients 
treated with nonopiate protocols since the program's launch, 
eventually needed opiates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;I believe that the initial successes of this program make 
it very important that we--to have a broader implementation and 
study. I leave this to your discretion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;That is why Senator Booker and I plan to introduce 
legislation to establish a national demonstration program to 
test pain management protocols that limit the use of opiates in 
hospital-based emergency departments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Pascrell"&gt;It is my hope that strategies that provide alternatives to 
opiates can become a larger part of the discussion on how to 
combat this--the opiate epidemic and that this committee will 
review and consider my legislation upon its introduction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS MACARTHUR, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. THOMAS MACARTHUR"&gt;    Mr. MacArthur, you are recognized for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. MacArthur&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;Well, I thank the Chairman Burgess and
Ranking Member Green for hosting this opportunity today for 
those of us not on this committee to share our thoughts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;We have all seen the numbers. Last year, over 60,000 deaths 
from overdose, opioids involved in the vast majority of those.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;In Ocean County, New Jersey, my home county, we are losing 
somebody every 43 hours. A couple of weeks ago, my county was 
designated a high-intensity drug trafficking area--desperately 
needed, but also disturbing sign of where we are.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;It may be unusual for a member to sit here and promote 
other people's bills, even bills written by the other party. 
But as the Republican cochairman of the bipartisan Heroin Task 
Force, representing over 90 members of both parties, that is 
exactly what I am here to do today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;As your committee considers legislative next steps to 
pursue, I want to recommend the bipartisan Heroin Task Force's 
legislative agenda for your consideration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;We are committed to being rigorously bipartisan. We did not 
include any bills in our agenda unless it had bipartisan 
cosponsors and both the Republican and the Democratic cochairs 
agreed to it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;Five of the bills that were recommended fall within your 
jurisdiction. Representative Tim Walberg's Jessie's Law will 
ensure that doctors have access to a consenting patient's prior 
history of addiction so they can make informed decisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;Representative David Joyce's Stop OD Act will increase 
first responders' access to Narcan and synthetic opioid 
testing. Representative Hakeem Jeffries' Synthetic Drug 
Awareness Act requires that we investigate how the synthetic 
opioid crisis is affecting young people specifically.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;Representative Evan Jenkins' CRIB Act will ensure treatment 
for babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome, and 
Representative Brian Fitzpatrick's Road to Recovery Act 
addresses the IMD exclusion, which is one of the primary 
barriers preventing access to substance abuse treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;We are proud of our members' work. I would also note that 
many of our agenda ideas coincide with the White House's Opioid 
Commission's recommendations and I also note the good work 
being done by the Republican Main Street on this same issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;On behalf of my Democratic cochair, Representative Annie 
Kuster, our vice chairs, Donald Norcross and Brian Fitzpatrick, 
and our 90-plus members, I urge you to consider these bills.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"&gt;We will continue to expand and update our legislative 
agenda as we tackle this critical issue facing our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Thomas MacArthur"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Thomas MacArthur"&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to testify. We have all seen 
the numbers--drug overdose deaths have increased from 52,000 in 
2015 to an estimated 64,000 last year, with opioids involved in 
the majority of those deaths. In Ocean County, New Jersey--my 
home county--someone dies of an overdose, on average, once 
every 43 hours. So thank you for the committee's work on this 
incredibly important subject.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Thomas MacArthur"&gt;It may be unusual for a Member to sit here and promote 
other people's bills, even bills written by the other party, 
but as the Republican cochairman of the Bipartisan Heroin Task

decisions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Thomas MacArthur"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Rep. David Joyce's STOP OD Act, which would expand 
efforts to prevent addiction, promote treatment and recovery, 
and increase first responders' access to Naloxone and synthetic 
opioid testing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Thomas MacArthur"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Rep. Hakeem Jeffries' Synthetic Drug Awareness 
Act, which requires that we investigate how the synthetic 
opioid crisis is affecting young people specifically.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Thomas MacArthur"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Rep. Evan Jenkin's CRIB Act, which would help 
increase access to treatment for babies with neonatal 
abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to exposure to opioids during 
pregnancy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Thomas MacArthur"&gt;&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; And Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick's Road to Recovery Act, 
which would address the IMD exclusion, which we all recognize 
as one of primary barriers preventing access to substance abuse 
treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Vice Chairs Donald Norcross and Brian Fitzpatrick, and our 90-

continue to expand and update our legislative agenda as we 
tackle additional critical topics like PDMPs and prescriber 
education, and we stand ready to work with committee staff 
however we can to promote good legislation that addresses all 
aspects of this devastating epidemic.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. TOM O'HALLERAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. 
O'Halleran, for 3 minutes, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;Mr. O'Halleran. Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and 
members of the committee, thank you for allowing me to come 
before you today to testify on an issue that has had a 
devastating impact on my district.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;I want to, first of all, echo the sentiments of 
Representative MacArthur. I am also on the task force.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;At least two Arizonans die every day from opioid overdoses. 
Last year, deaths due to opioids rose 16 percent from the year 
before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;As a former law enforcement officer, some of what I see 
today is familiar from my time serving communities--the 
harrowing stories of addiction, the pain family members face 
including child abuse, domestic abuse, and the loss of a loved 
one, and also the relationship to organized crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;But I must tell you that what we are seeing today, the 
devastation that opioids have wrought on our communities is far 
more impactful than the drugs I fought to keep off the streets 
when I was a cop.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;Over the summer, I held a round table in my district on 
opioids. I heard from families, first responders, local law 
enforcement, and health care providers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;I am here today to bring their voices to you as we commit 
to tackling this issue in a bipartisan and comprehensive way.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;As you work to develop policies to combat this epidemic, I 
implore you to consider the impacts to rural communities and to 
tribal communities, which face unique obstacles and barriers to 
treatment, care, and recovery resources.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;According to the CDC, American Indian and Alaska natives 
have the highest death rates from opioids than any other 
community. American Indians and Alaska natives have long faced 
disparities when it comes to resources for mental health care 
and substance abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;That's why funding created by the 21st Century Cures Act, 
in addition to expanded Medicaid coverage in Arizona, have been 
crucial in helping families get the care they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;As many of your know, access to crucial healthcare services 
in rural communities and across Indian country can be scarce 
and often requires families to travel long distances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;Providers in rural America have benefited from expanded 
Medicaid coverage and are now seeing lower rates of uninsured 
patients than before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;In fact, in States that expanded Medicaid, the share of 
uninsured substance use or mental health disorder 
hospitalizations fell from 20 percent in 2013 to 5 percent in 
2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;The increase in coverage has allowed rural providers to 
operate on the thinnest of margins, to help keep their lights 
on and their doors open. If Congress repeals that coverage, 
rural providers will close their doors and patients who need 
the help will face fewer choices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;We need to give States, local law enforcement, and tribes 
more resources and more flexibility to test what works. But we 
must approach this problem comprehensively and with a robust 
commitment to those we represent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="HON. TOM O'HALLERAN"&gt;I urge your committee to thoughtfully consider these issues 
and how they affect communities across rural and tribal 
communities. Those voices must be heard when it comes to this 
crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Tom O'Halleran"&gt;American Indian and Alaska Natives have long faced 
disparities when it comes to resources for mental health care 
and substance abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Tom O'Halleran"&gt;That's why funding created by the 21st Century Cures Act, 
in addition to expanded Medicaid coverage in Arizona have been 
crucial in helping families get the care they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Tom O'Halleran"&gt;As many of you know, access to critical health care 
services in rural communities and across Indian Country can be 
scarce, and often requires families to travel long distances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Tom O'Halleran"&gt;Providers in rural America have benefitted from expanded 
Medicaid coverage, and are now seeing lower rates of uninsured 
patients than before. In fact, in States that expanded 
Medicaid, the share of uninsured substance use or mental health 
disorder hospitalizations fell from 20 percent in 2013 to about 
5 percent in 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Tom O'Halleran"&gt;The increase in coverage has allowed rural providers, who 
operate on the thinnest of margins, to help keep their lights 
on and their doors open. In communities across my district, 
these providers are the backbone of care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Tom O'Halleran"&gt;If Congress repeals that coverage, rural providers will 
close their doors and patients who need help now will face 
fewer choices. We need to work with each other to build on the 
progress we've made, not go backwards.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Tom O'Halleran"&gt;We need to give States, local law enforcement, and tribes 
more resources and more flexibility to test what works. But we 
must approach this problem comprehensively, and with a robust 
commitment to those we represent. For too long, care and 
resources have been delivered in silos, and those looking for 
help have had to navigate a patchwork of programs, many of 
which were never created to address the scope of the problems 
we're seeing today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Tom O'Halleran"&gt;I urge your committee to thoughtfully consider these issues 
and how they affect communities across rural and tribal 
communities, whose voices must be heard when it comes to this 
crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Tom O'Halleran"&gt;    Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Gentleman yields back. The Chair thanks the
gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;If you wish to be excused, you may do so. But we are all 
anxious to hear what the gentleman from Maine has to share with 
us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. BRUCE POLIQUIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF MAINE&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. BRUCE POLIQUIN"&gt;    So, Mr. Poliquin, you are recognized for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Poliquin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much and thank
you, Ranking Member, for the opportunity to be in front of you 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;In our great State of Maine, Mr. Chairman, we have on 
average one person dies every day from a drug overdose. There 
was a recent study that said that six out of 10 families in our 
great State--six out of 10, Mr. Chairman--are impacted directly 
or indirectly by this epidemic, including, I might add, my own 
family.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;Rural Maine has been hard hit. Rural America has been hard 
hit with this epidemic and that is why I joined the bipartisan 
task force to combat the heroin epidemic and that led in part 
to a very comprehensive bill that we all passed in a bipartisan 
way last year, the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, that 
sent about a billion dollars back to our States so they had 
better resources and more flexibility to address this scourge 
on our kids and our family members directly at the--on the 
ground in our--in our respective districts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;Now, the motto, Mr. Chairman, of the great State of Maine 
is ``Dirigo.`` It means, in Latin, ``I lead.'' And there are a 
bunch of things we have been doing in Maine to help fight this 
epidemic that I think the rest of the country can learn as we 
learn from others.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;We have put in place a prescription monitoring program that 
is very tough and very effective. In particular, it sets very 
strict limits on what opioid--opiates are prescribed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;It mandates the use of this system by prescribers and if 
you are prescribing opioids in the State of Maine, you must 
check this program--this database--on a regular basis to make 
sure those that are being prescribed should be, in fact, those 
that are receiving the painkillers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;If folks are coming from out of State or they're paying 
with cash, it also triggers a review of the program to make 
sure that these drugs are falling in the hands of the right 
people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;Now, I also serve, Mr. Chairman, I might add, on the House 
Veterans Affairs Committee, and along with Mr. Dunn, Ms. 
Tenney, Jodey Arrington from Texas, and Mr. Tonko, we have 
introduced a bill that asks the Veterans Administration 
facilities in the State of Maine, and hopefully around the 
country, to use their local State prescription monitoring 
programs or to interface with those because they're more 
comprehensive. In many cases, they are tougher.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;I would also encourage you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking 
Member, as you are going down this path to make sure we do 
everything humanly possible to hold those that are 
manufacturing synthetic opioids like fentanyl, hold them 
accountable. These drugs are horrible, they are not expensive 
to manufacture, and they are anywhere from 50 to 100 times more 
potent than heroin and methadone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt;So with that, sir, I appreciate the opportunity to 
participate here. I know that my associates on either side of 
me have a lot to say. But we've done a lot in Maine, and we are 
very proud of it. But we've got a lot more work to do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Bruce Poliquin&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Bruce Poliquin"&gt;Thank you, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Bruce Poliquin"&gt;Good afternoon, Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green and 
members of the subcommittee. I appreciate the opportunity to 
discuss an issue that touches so many Maine families, including 
my own. An increasing number of Mainers are severely affected 
by drug abuse and addiction. In 2015 alone, 269 Mainers died of 
an opioid overdose. It is clear that we must work to solve this 
serious problem impacting Maine and the rest of our Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Bruce Poliquin"&gt;I am a founding member of the Bipartisan Task Force to 
Combat the Heroin Epidemic. Since 2015, we have been a force 
for action, addressing the epidemic by learning from 
professionals in communities impacted by addiction. We have 
welcomed panelists, who have been able to provide valuable, 
real-life insight to help us work toward common-sense 
solutions. The Task Force helped bring awareness to the 
Nation's need to address drug prevention and treatment, as well 
as to ensure that law enforcement officers have the tools 
necessary to fight this epidemic. I'm pleased that Congress 
responded to this crisis by passing the Comprehensive Addiction 
and Recovery Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Bruce Poliquin"&gt;This legislation was a crucial step towards recovery for 
our families, friends, and communities, but was just one of 
many steps on the long road ahead. I am here today to discuss 
the importance of advancements in tools for prevention, 
enhanced reforms for bad actors, and our role in fostering 
interagency communication.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Bruce Poliquin"&gt;In order to help ensure that patients are not abusing 
prescriptions, Maine has set strict limits on opioid 
prescriptions. In addition to mandating the use of the 
prescription monitoring program, Maine requires prescribers to 
check the program when first prescribing, and every 90 days 
thereafter, requires dispensers to check the respective State's 
program when dispensing to an out-of-State resident and for a 
prescription written by an out-of-State provider. The dispenser 
also needs to check the program if an individual is paying with 
cash or if the person has not had a prescription for an opioid 
medication in the previous 12 months.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Bruce Poliquin"&gt;These additional requirements create significant barriers 
to those attempting to abuse the system. Looking forward, it is 
crucial that we work toward the sharing of data between States 
to further deter system abuse and decrease the number of 
patients who will develop an addiction. As a member of the 
House Veterans Affairs Committee, I, along with Rep. Dunn, Rep. 
Tenney, Rep. Arrington and Rep. Tonko, have introduced the 
Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act to ensure that providers 
from the Department of Veterans Affairs also use the program 
when prescribing controlled substances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Bruce Poliquin"&gt;There will always be bad actors, but it is our 
responsibility to remain steadfast in our work to close any 
loopholes for abuse. As the Energy and Commerce Committee 
continues to examine synthetic opioids, it is crucial that law 
enforcement receive the resources they need to hold accountable 
those who illegally manufacture fentanyl. The death rate for 
synthetic opioids other than methadone has significantly 
increased in Maine. The Task Force has discussed how local law 
enforcement can collaborate with the Federal and State 
governments as well as public health agencies to combat the use 
of synthetic opioids. Furthermore, we have discussed how the 
investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security works 
with Federal, State, and local law enforcement to investigate 
criminal organizations that are participating in the 
trafficking of synthetic drugs. I hope to continue these 
discussions as we review and modify best practices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Bruce Poliquin"&gt;    As we continue to work towards addressing today's crisis 
and future threats, I would like to thank you for your time and 
attention to these critical issues.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Chair thanks the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Would the gentleman entertain one question on your 
prescription drug monitoring program?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Poliquin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; Do you provide feedback to the prescribing
doctor: This is the list of patients we have for you that you 
have prescribed? Is this a two-way street?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Poliquin&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Poliquin"&gt; It is, but the system is quite accurate, Mr.
Chairman, such that the prescriber can see that data online.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Very well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID ROUZER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. DAVID ROUZER"&gt;    Representative Rouzer, you are recognized for 3 minutes, 
please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rouzer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the other members
of this distinguished committee for your work to bring 
awareness to this opioid epidemic as well as your work to bring 
forward solutions to help address it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;I am particularly grateful for your willingness to allow 
members who do not serve on this committee the opportunity to 
share how our districts have been impacted by this scourge.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;Opioid addiction has become a growing problem throughout 
North Carolina and particularly in the southeastern part of the 
State, home of the 7th Congressional District, which I have the 
privilege to represent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;It is a growing and significant challenge for our 
communities, parents, law enforcement, local health 
departments, treatment facilities, and schools, to name just a 
few.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;This epidemic is so rampant, in fact, it would not be a 
stretch to say that if a family doesn't have a relative 
suffering from this addiction, they know a friend or a family 
who does.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;Perhaps most alarming to me are the reports out of my 
district about Narcan parties. That's right, Narcan parties. 
These are parties where teens and others go intending to get as 
high as possible with the expectation that they will be brought 
back to life by an injection of Narcan if needed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;I also hear from members of the law enforcement community 
that they are administering Narcan to the very same individuals 
on a regular, even weekly, basis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;Now, if this isn't a sobering fact of how this addiction is 
destroying lives, I don't know what is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;In 2015, there were more than 1,100 opioid-related deaths 
across the State of North Carolina. The three counties most 
impacted by the opioid epidemic in the 7th Congressional 
District are Brunswick, New Hanover, and Pender counties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;In 2015, there were 24 deaths in Brunswick County, 45 
deaths in New Hanover, and 14 deaths in Pender County. Now, 
I've met with and heard from parents who have lost a child to 
an overdose, law enforcement officers who are struggling daily 
to prevent this epidemic from further penetrating into our 
communities, and individuals working at treatment facilities 
who do not have enough resources or beds to keep up with the 
demand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;As with every complex problem, there is no silver bullet 
answer to this epidemic, unfortunately. However, it's my belief 
that Congress can play a significant role by facilitating 
collaboration among the very best and brightest to bring 
solutions forward that will enable the country to turn the 
tables on this scourge.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;In the 7th Congressional District, we are fortunate to have 
many bright and committed individuals who have been working 
diligently on this issue for some time, many of whom serve on 
my Law Enforcement and Health Care Advisory Committees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Rouzer"&gt;And each of them, Mr. Chairman, stand ready to assist this 
committee and Congress as we work to address this problem in a

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID YOUNG, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF IOWA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. DAVID YOUNG"&gt;    Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Young, for 3 
minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Young&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member. I
would like to thank the committee for holding this hearing and 
I just really want to tell a story.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;I want to highlight the actions the community of 
Bridgewater, Iowa has undertaken in the last year to take back 
their town. Bridgewater, a small town of about 200 people in 
Adair County in southwest Iowa, is facing a problem with 
opioids and a range of other drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;As drug use in the area slowly started to rise in the 
community, which relies on the county sheriff's office to keep 
them safe, the residents were unable but not unwilling to stop 
the influx of drugs into their town.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;Residents of Bridgewater started to see cars coming into 
their town with out-of-State license plates and from counties 
across the State as the cars came, so did the crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;Residents and law enforcement noticed an uptick of crimes, 
theft, and vandalism, which traced back to drug users and 
dealers coming to town. Empty houses turned into drug houses 
powered by gas and generators, which led to more than four 
houses burning to the ground.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;Last spring, the residents were fed up as they saw the town 
they were raised up in slipping away. They decided to take 
action. Concerned residents met in the basement of a church to 
find a way to save their town. This is when they decided to 
take back Bridgewater.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;Residents formed a nonprofit group to fight the drug crisis 
together. As word spread, media outlets across the State came 
to the small town to shine a light on one of the many 
communities suffering in this 3rd District.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;I visited Bridgewater in April to meet with the residents 
in that same church basement as they began their mission to 
make sure that their town was safe again. I studied their 
faces, listened intently, and their mission is my mission.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;They started to hold forums with drug counsellors, law 
enforcement, State and local legislators and other individuals 
offering help. As residents started to clean up their town, 
they were met with hostility and retaliation from drug dealers 
and users.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;Leaders of the take back Bridgewater movement were run off 
the road, swerved at by those who wanted to protect the status 
quo. A number of other incidents occurred but the residents 
pressed on. The citizens of Bridgewater will not surrender.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;As neighboring communities saw what the residents of 
Bridgewater were doing, they wanted to do something in their 
communities. Leaders from towns across southwest Iowa often 
discussed strategies together to protect their neighbors. That 
is what Iowa is all about--neighbors helping neighbors, 
communities helping communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;Just last night, residents of Bridgewater gathered in the 
basement of that very same church to kick off a fundraiser for 
their nonprofit. They will be going throughout southwest Iowa 
to sell Christmas trees to adorn the doors of homes throughout 
the region.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;Residents will use these funds to take back the community. 
Bridgewater will not turn a blind eye to opioids and drugs in 
their community. And, of course, we mustn't forget the human 
tragedy of addiction and desperation. This epidemic is 
enslaving and killing our sons and daughters, our mothers and 
fathers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;As the Federal Government addresses this issue, it is my 
hope we use Bridgewater as an example that local communities 
can have the largest impact if we partner with them and helping 
them to have those tools they need to be successful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;A one-size-fits-all program will not save as many lives as 
a solution tailored to one community which has the buy-in of 
its residents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Young"&gt;Take back Bridgewater is not just a slogan. It is an action 
plan, it is reality, and it is happening, and it is not just 
happening in Bridgewater. It is happening all around the 
country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

together. As word spread, media outlets across the State came 
to this small town to shine a light on one of many communities 
suffering in the 3rd District.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;I visited Bridgewater in April to meet with residents in 
that church basement as they began their mission to make their 
town safe again. I studied their faces. I listened intently. 
And their mission is my mission.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;They started to hold forums with drug counselors, law 
enforcement, State and local legislators, and other individuals 
offering help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;As residents started to clean up their town they were met 
with hostility and retaliation from drug dealers and users.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;Leaders of the Take Back Bridgewater movement were run off 
the road, swerved at by those who wanted to protect the status 
quo. A number of other incidents occurred, but the residents 
pressed on. The citizens of Bridgewater will not surrender.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;As neighboring communities saw what the residents of 
Bridgewater were doing, they wanted to do the something in 
their communities. Leaders from towns across southwest Iowa 
often discuss strategies together to protect their neighbors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;That is what Iowa is all about: neighbors helping 
neighbors, communities helping communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;Just last night, residents of Bridgewater gathered in the 
basement of that very same church to kick off a fundraiser for 
their nonprofit. They will be going throughout southwest Iowa 
to sell Christmas wreaths to adorn the doors of homes 
throughout the region.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;Residents will use the funds to take back their community. 
Bridgewater will not turn a blind eye to opioids and drugs in 
their community. And of course we must not forget this this 
human tragedy of addiction and desperation. This epidemic is 
enslaving and killing our sons and daughters; mothers and 
fathers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;As the Federal Government addresses this issue, it is my 
hope we use Bridgewater as an example local communities can 
have the largest impact if we partner with them and helping 
with the tools they need to be successful. A one-size-fits-all 
program will not save as many lives as a solution tailored to 
each community which has the buy-in of its residents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;Take Back Bridgewater is not just a slogan. It's an action 
plan. It's a reality. And it's happening. And it's not just 
happening in Bridgewater, it's happening all around the 
country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Hon. David Young"&gt;    Thank you again for the opportunity to join you today.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. EARL BLUMENAUER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF OREGON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. EARL BLUMENAUER"&gt;    The gentleman from Oregon, Mr. Blumenauer, recognized for 3 
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Blumenauer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Blumenauer"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the
focus on the opioid crisis that grips every community to some 
degree and affects every State, especially critical for our 
veterans who are twice as likely to die from accidental 
overdoses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Blumenauer"&gt;As we are slowly acknowledging the depths of the opioid 
crisis, which is good, we seldom acknowledge one of the 
simplest most effective solutions--medical marijuana. Cannabis. 
Now available in 28 States, largely driven by the voters, not 
the politicians, most recently in Florida, where their voters 
approved it by over 70 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Blumenauer"&gt;I have distributed some information here entitled, ``The 
Physician Guide to Cannabis-Assisted Opioid Reduction'' On the 
back are the citations for each of the points that are on this 
chart referencing cannabis reducing opioid overdose mortality, 
how cannabis reduces opioid consumption, how cannabis can 
prevent dose escalation and the development of opioid 
tolerance. Cannabis alone or in combination with opioids could 
be a viable first line analgesic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Blumenauer"&gt;Mr. Chairman, we don't talk much about this, although on 
the floor of the House repeatedly over the last 3 years 
Congress has been moving in this direction and voted last 
Congress to have the Veterans Administration be able to work 
with veterans in States where medical marijuana is legal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Blumenauer"&gt;But I focus on just one simple item, not the facts, which I 
hope this committee would look at. But there is one piece of 
legislation that I have introduced with Dr. Andy Harris, 
somebody who doesn't agree with me about the efficacy of 
medical marijuana but he strongly agrees with me that there is 
no longer any reason for the Federal Government to interfere 
with research to be able to prove it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Blumenauer"&gt;The Federal Government as a stranglehold on this research. 
We have bipartisan legislation, 3391, which would break that 
stranglehold and be able to have robust research to resolve 
these questions so there would no longer be any doubt.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Blumenauer"&gt;This is the cheapest, most effective way to be able to stop 
the crisis. Where people have access to medical marijuana, 
there are fewer overdoses and people opt for it dealing with 
chronic pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Earl Blumenauer&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Earl Blumenauer"&gt;I would appreciate the subcommittee looking at this issue 
as your time permits. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Earl Blumenauer"&gt;As this hearing today highlights, opioids have wreaked 
havoc on our country, killing people and devastating families. 
I am here today to offer an alternative treatment for pain, 
PTSD, and a number of other health problems-medical cannabis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Earl Blumenauer"&gt;Despite the fact that more than 95 percent of Americans 
live in States that have legalized some form of medical 
cannabis, Federal policy is blocking biomedical research of 
marijuana.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Earl Blumenauer"&gt;This is outrageous!&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Earl Blumenauer"&gt;We owe it to patients and their families to allow for the 
research physicians need to understand marijuana's benefits and 
risks and determine proper use and dosage. The Federal 
Government should get out of the way to allow for this long 
overdue research.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Earl Blumenauer"&gt;Unfortunately, States cannot address this research gag on 
their own. Congress must act to allow for the research of 
marijuana-which I stipulate would be a safer, less addictive 
alternative than opioids for some health problems.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Earl Blumenauer"&gt;And, it's not just me who thinks this. I have veterans 
banging down my door seeking alternatives to opioids. Many 
veterans are in an untenable situation-- Untreated chronic pain 
can increase the risk of suicide, but poorly managed opioid 
regimens can also be fatal. The fact that veterans are TWICE as 
likely to die from accidental opioid overdoses than their 
civilian counterparts to get Congress off the dime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Earl Blumenauer"&gt;Dr. Andy Harris--a well-known marijuana prohibitionist--and 
I--the Member of Congress from Portlandia--have teamed up to 
introduce the Medical Marijuana Research Act. This bill would 
create a pathway for qualified researchers to conduct research 
using marijuana. Senators Hatch and Schatz have a similar bill 
on the Senate side.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Earl Blumenauer"&gt;    I ask that this committee hold a hearing on the bill as 
patients desperately need a safer, less addictive alternative 
to opioids.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. KAREN C. HANDEL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Georgia, Mrs. Handel, 
for 3 minutes, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;Mrs. Handel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you as well 
for holding this hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;The opioid crisis has hit the suburban Atlanta counties of 
Fulton, Cobb, and DeKalb as hard as, frankly, anywhere in the 
country, from prescription painkillers to synthetic drugs to 
heroin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;In 2016, 72.3 percent of all drug-related fatalities in 
Cobb County were caused by opioids and that was an increase 
from 16.8 percent just the year before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;In 2015, the Cobb County narcotics team seized more than--
more heroin than in the previous 20 years combined. Meanwhile, 
in Fulton County, the medical examiner's office recorded a 
total of 77 heroin deaths in 2014. That is compared to just 
four such deaths in 2010.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;Behind these statistics, though, are hurting devastated 
families--families that are being torn apart by addiction, 
facing financial ruin in their desperate effort to try anything 
to make things right, or worse, losing a loved one to a drug 
overdose or suicide.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;The opioid crisis, as we've heard, is indeed a complex one. 
It is an incredibly sensitive issue, particularly for 
communities that have long felt immune to fatal substance abuse 
problems.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;Still, communities, through churches, law enforcement, 
nonprofits, with the support of local, State, and Federal 
government are coming together to take action.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;This year in the city of Alpharetta, they created a new 
program designed to reduce painkiller abuse across the county. 
With the help of the Rotary Club in Alpharetta, the city 
purchased special boxes that were--are used to collect unused 
and unwanted prescription medication and locating those at 
police headquarters and fire stations throughout the county.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;While the boxes cost about a thousand dollars each, they 
are designed and constructed specifically to prevent anyone 
from stealing the drugs inside. This is--may seem a small 
measure, but it is making an impact by providing a safe secure 
disposal point.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;In the city of Johns Creek, the Hub Community Resource 
Center is acting as a lifeline for those seeking drug abuse and 
mental illness attention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;Ultimately, the incarceration of addicts, though, should 
not be seen as some kind of victory or solution. Instead, we 
have to continue to look for the root causes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;As the district attorney in Cobb County said, we are not 
going to be able to arrest our way out of this epidemic. The 
road to recovery must be lined with treatment options.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;So further, nonopioid and nonpharmacalogical treatments for 
therapies do exist. Atlanta's Emory University recognized Pain 
Awareness Month in September by educating our community about 
these alternatives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="HON. KAREN C. HANDEL"&gt;We also need to do a better job of data sharing important 
information that exists at the local, State, and Federal level. 
I stand ready to help you in any way.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Karen C. Handel&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;The opioid crisis has hit the suburban Atlanta counties of 
Fulton, Cobb &amp;amp; Dekalb as hard as anywhere in the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;In 2016, 72.3 percent of all drug-related fatalities in 
Cobb County were caused by opioids, up from 64.8 percent just 1 
year before. And in 2015, the Cobb County Narcotics team seized 
more heroin than in the previous 20 years--combined.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;Meanwhile, in neighboring Fulton County, the Medical 
Examiner's Office recorded a total of 77 heroin deaths in 2014, 
compared to just four in 2010.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;Behind these statistics are hurting families--families that 
are being torn apart by addiction, facing financial ruin in 
their effort to try anything to make things right, or worse, 
losing a loved one to overdose or suicide.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;Our community's--our Nation's--opioid crisis is a complex 
issue, and it's not going to be solved with any single 
proposal. Admitting there is a problem is the first step, 
however.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;This is an uncomfortable, sensitive issue, particularly in 
communities that have long felt immune to fatal substance abuse 
problems. Still, communities--through churches, law 
enforcement, non profits--are coming together to take action.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;This year, the North Fulton city of Alpharetta created a 
new program designed to reduce painkiller abuse across the 
county. With the help of Alpharetta's Rotary Club, the city 
purchased boxes that will collect unused and unwanted 
prescription medications at its police headquarters and fire 
stations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;The boxes cost about $1,000 each and are designed and 
constructed to prevent anyone from stealing the drugs inside.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;It may seem a small measure, but it is making an impact by 
providing a safe, secure disposal point.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;In the city of Johns Creek, the Hub Community Resource 
Center acts as a lifeline for those seeking drug abuse and 
mental illness attention. Centers like these help people 
suffering from addiction and prevent others from succumbing to 
the same fate in the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;Ultimately, the incarceration of addicts should not be seen 
as some kind of victory or solution. Instead, we must look at 
the root causes, most effective potential solutions, and--most 
importantly--we must work towards finding ways for those 
affected by opioid addiction to recover to lead healthy, 
productive lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;As Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds said, ``We 
cannot arrest our way out of this epidemic. The road to 
recovery must be lined with treatment options.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;Further, nonopioid and nonpharmacological treatments or 
therapies for pain do exist. Studies show that these 
alternative therapies can be just as beneficial or better than 
prescription pain medications, but without the side effects of 
overuse and abuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;Atlanta's Emory University recognized Pain Awareness Month 
in September by educating the community about pain relief 
alternatives to prescription medications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;As the opioid epidemic spreads, we need data and 
alternatives to medications now more than ever.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;Finally, I want to specifically commend two legislators in 
my home State of Georgia--State Senator Renee Untermann and 
State Representative Sharon Cooper--each of whom have been 
leading the efforts on opioid addiction prevention from the 
State capitol. Senator Unterman is the chairman of the 
Committee on Health and Human Services and sponsor of SB81, 
legislation focused on Naloxone availability and electronic 
reporting of controlled substances in Georgia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Karen C. Handel"&gt;    We can do better than this crisis we're facing across the 
country, and creative options like those we're seeing 
throughout the 6th District of Georgia are all part of the 
national effort. Our local, State and Federal law enforcement, 
healthcare groups, drug enforcement agencies and elected 
leaders must continue to work together. The lives of tens of 
thousands of Americans are literally depending on it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLIE CRIST, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. CHARLIE CRIST"&gt;    Recognize Representative Crist from Florida, 3 minutes, 
please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Crist&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;I would like to thank Chairman Burgess and
Ranking Member Green for providing us this opportunity for 
Members to share how the opioid crisis is affecting their 
constituents, including my neighbors in Pinellas County, 
Florida.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;The statistics for opioid deaths and disorders are 
shocking. Our society's use of opioids has truly become an 
epidemic. Last year, 11.8 million Americans age 12 or older 
misused opioids, including nearly 900,000 children age 12 to 
17.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;Over 50 percent of the people with both substance abuse and 
a mental health disorder do not receive treatment for either 
issue. Tragically, my home State of Florida was the 
prescription drug abuse capital of the United States in the 
last decade.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;They were known as pills mills and prescribed massive 
amounts of otherwise legal narcotics which were then 
distributed into our neighbourhoods, schools, communities, and 
throughout the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;When I was Governor, we went after pill mills and put them 
out of business. While Florida may have won the battle against 
these pill mills, our country is losing the war on opioid abuse 
and its addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;We are ignoring mental health, under funding addiction 
treatment, sidestepping what the science tells us is the best 
way to fight the addiction, and now the scope of the crisis has 
broadened beyond prescription drugs into heroin and even 
fentanyl.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;My home of Pinellas County was no exception. Last year, we 
saw a string of deaths from Xanax mixed with fentanyl. In 2015, 
heroin, fentanyl, and oxycodone were responsible for over 3,800 
deaths in Florida alone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;It is a tragedy, it is an epidemic, and the need for action 
is immediate. I saw the devastation firsthand recently when I 
visited the nonprofit Operation PAR in my district just a few 
months ago.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;I heard directly from those in recovery being helped by 
their innovative, more holistic approach.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;If we are going to combat this problem, we can't 
concentrate on law enforcement alone. Florida should serve as 
an example to the rest of the country that only going after 
suppliers is insufficient.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;Let us be clear. The people who misuse opioids aren't the 
worst of the worst. They are our neighbors, our friends, 
parents, and children who are desperately in need of help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;They often suffer in silence and isolation because of the 
stigma and shame surrounding drug abuse. Unfortunately, America 
learned this lesson the hard way, treating the crack epidemic 
as simply a law enforcement exercise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;We can't combat our opioid crisis without investing in new 
treatment options, long-term mental health, and substance abuse 
recovery resources, and the men and women on the ground working 
in nonprofits and Government, collaborating with first 
responders and law enforcement to help those in need in all of 
our communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;This includes funding for the substance abuse mental health 
service and the National Institutes of Health, which provides 
the research and innovative treatments not often permitted 
using traditional funding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;This funding provides grants including in Pinellas County 
for innovative local solutions for treating mental health and 
substance abuse disorders, like what is happening at Operation 
PAR and Bent Not Broken organization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Crist"&gt;This includes funding overdose reversal. We will lose this 
fight without Naloxone. Americans will die unnecessarily, and 
because Florida did not expand Medicaid, the funding for these 
organizations is even more vital and something I hope your 
committee continues to prioritize in this ongoing battle.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN J. FASO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. JOHN J. FASO"&gt;    The Chair recognizes Mr. Faso for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Faso&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member
Green, and members of the committee for holding this important 
hearing and hosting all of us today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;I appreciate and understand many of the testimonies we have 
heard from our colleagues. It is important to note that we 
represent districts that are often extremely different from 
each other--Democrat, Republican, rural, and urban. It is rare 
when an issue can unite not only a conference but an entire 
Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;At the risk of speaking for my colleagues, I would like to 
express that we all stand together against the opioid epidemic. 
Now, in my district, in the 19th District in upstate New York, 
I can tell you a couple of stories.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;Greene County emergency responders recently reported to me 
they came upon a scene where they had two individuals who had 
overdosed. One individual required eight doses of Naloxone in 
order to be revived. Another required six.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;This is not an uncommon phenomena. County sheriffs had 
reported to me going back to the same household, the same 
apartments on the same evening to administer Narcan to revive 
people who have overdosed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;Other county sheriffs have told me that every single drug 
dealer they arrest has public benefit and food stamp cards in 
their possession. It is ironic that we, the public, are often 
sustaining economically those that prey upon our citizens.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;In my district in the Board of Supervisors in Columbia 
County recently passed an opioid epidemic response plan. This 
plan is an enormous step forward to combatting the opioid 
crisis in our region.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;Ulster County has also substantially increased local 
funding to fight the crisis. Twin County Recovery Services in 
Columbia and Greene Counties is also serving those with 
addiction through clinical, residential, and educational 
programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;And I think the bottom line, Mr. Chairman, my colleagues, 
we have got to have educational programs that help us staunch 
the demand for these substances and not just try to staunch the 
supply.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;Congress must continue to help our local communities by 
ensuring they have the support and the 21st Century Cures and 
CARA, supporting SAMHSA legislation, and passing legislation 
such as the STOP Act to support our local law enforcement 
officers by making it more difficult for the U.S. Postal 
Service to ship fentanyl and carfentanyl through the mail.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;I recommend more research into how opioids affect the brain 
and learn more into how to defeat this chemical dependency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Faso"&gt;Our work is far from finished. We must stay engaged with 
each other, stay engaged with our communities and stay engaged 
with victims and families to truly effectuate and facilitate an 
authentic reversal of this dangerous and upward trend of opioid 
addiction in our communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. John J. Faso&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;I thank the committee for their service and for allowing us 
to bring this testimony forth today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and 
members of the committee for holding this important hearing and 
hosting me today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;I appreciate and understand many of the testimonies we have 
heard from our colleagues. It is important to note that we 
represent districts that are extremely different from each 
other; Democrat, Republican, rural, and urban. It is rare when 
an issue can unite not only a conference, but an entire 
Congress. At the risk of speaking for my colleagues, I would 
like to express that we stand together against the opioid 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;My particular district in upstate New York is fairly rural,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;When we think of rural America, it evokes images of small 
towns, diners on the corners, two lane roads framed by family 
farms, and a community where neighbors look out for each other, 
and work hard for what they have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;While all of these sentiments ring especially true in my 
district, so does the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;Our local communities and counties across upstate are 
stepping up to the plate and finding ways to address this 
problem in a manner that meets their needs. With help from the 
State and Federal governments, our local governments and groups 
facilitate outreach programs, education programs, informational 
resources, trainings and working groups.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;In my district, the Board of Supervisors of Columbia County 
recently passed an Opioid Epidemic Response Plan. This plan is 
an enormous step forward in combating the opioid crisis in our 
region. Twin County Recovery Services is also another 
institution in my district serving those with addiction through 
clinical, residential, and educational programs. These 
initiatives enable local entities to most effectively help 
those with addiction, educate first responders, prevent future 
tragedies, and deploy Federal and State funding in our 
communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;I come before the committee today to implore my colleagues 
to work with me to empower local governments, that are closest 
to the crisis, to improve education and prevention programs and 
fight addiction on the front lines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;Congress must continue to help our local communities by 
ensuring they have our support through means such as adequately 
implementing and funding CARA and 21st Century Cures, 
supporting SAMHSA (sam-sa) and passing legislation such as the 
STOP Act to support our local law enforcement officers by 
making it more difficult to ship fentanyl and carfentanil.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;I appreciate committee-led initiatives to work in a 
bipartisan-nature in passing ground-breaking addiction 
treatment legislation, holding numerous hearings to explore 
further Congressional action, and remaining open and inclusive 
during this process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;Our work is far from finished. We must stay engaged with 
each other, stay engaged with our communities, and stay engaged 
with the victims to truly, and effectively facilitate an 
authentic reversal of this dangerous upward trend of opioid 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. John J. Faso"&gt;    I stand ready to help the committee in this fight. Thank 
you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN KATKO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROMTHE STATE OF NEW YORK&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. JOHN KATKO"&gt;    Chair recognizes Mr. Katko for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Katko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member
Green. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to testify 
today about this most important topic and giving me the 
opportunity to not only discuss what has been being discussed 
but a possible partial solution to the problem from a law 
enforcement standpoint.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;And that is a bill that I introduced, H.R. 2851, the Stop 
the Importation Trafficking of Synthetic Analogs Act of 2017, 
which I will refer to as SITSA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;I am driven in my testimony today and my support for this 
bill by two things. One is my 20 years as a Federal organized-
crime prosecutor, prosecuting every manner of drug known to 
man, and knowing that, based on that experience, I have never 
seen anything that remotely resembles the tragic consequences 
of the current synthetic drug problem and the heroin issue in 
this country, and they are intertwined.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;And I can talk chapter and verse about what is going on in 
my community but I just want to introduce you to a few people 
that we have lost since I have been in Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;John and Tina Socci lost their daughter, who was murdered 
in front of her 18-month-old child by her boyfriend, who was 
addicted to opioids. Two years later, still grieving the loss 
of their daughter, they lost their son to a heroin overdose. 
Their son was a drug counselor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;Joe Campanella lost his son--I am sorry--Joe Campanella 
lost a son and his son was a drug counselor at the time, and 
John Socci and Tina Socci lost their son as well. Kevin Jones 
lost his stepdaughter.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;Theresa Wilson lost her son after he ingested synthetic 
marijuana that was purchased over the counter at a local head 
shop and he had convulsions and drowned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;Deanna Axe--all these stories are tragic but this one is 
perhaps the worst--Deanna was a high school athlete, a great 
individual. She got involved with heroin after abusing opiates 
and she became pregnant. She went cold turkey and quit. She was 
five months pregnant and she had not had any relapses 
whatsoever.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;A drug dealer who I can only describe as one of the most 
reprehensible creatures on earth, cajoled her into trying one 
more time because a new mixture had come in. She tried it that 
one time and she died, and she lost her five-month-old child as 
well--unborn child.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;That is the face of this tragedy. That is the face of what 
is going on here and that is what I am trying to address with 
respect to the SITSA Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;Toxic synthetic drugs are designed to mimic street drugs 
like marijuana and what this drug is trying to do is recodify 
the problem. The problem I encountered when I was a prosecutor 
doing synthetic drugs prosecutions is that the statutes don't 
keep up.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;The drug that killed Theresa Wilson's son took 4 1A\1/2\ 
years after they identified the chemical compound before it was 
listed in a drug analog statute.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;This bill that I have that has already passed the Judiciary 
and is simply waiting to get out of E and C before it can be 
voted on on the floor and I think will pass overwhelmingly 
turbo charges that process to reduce it to about 30 days, and 
it also, in a nutshell, will give individuals in Congress who 
may disagree with the classification of one of these drugs 180 
days after it is classified to have it removed through a 
congressional act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;So I was going to talk much longer about it. I realize my 
time is up. But I can tell you from looking through the prism 
of a prosecutor there is three ways that you need to address 
this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;Number one is law enforcement, number two is prevention, 
and number three is treatment. As my colleague, Mr. Faso, 
noted, we have done a lot with the CARA Act and other things to 
address prevention and treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Katko"&gt;This SITSA Act is something that law enforcement needs and, 
quite frankly, it is a game changer and I hope that E and C 
will consider it in a swift manner so it can get to floor for a 
vote and get into law and give another--put it in the arsenal 
for law enforcement to be able to attack this problem in a 
meaningful manner.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. John Katko&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and 
members of the Subcommittee on Health, for allowing me to speak 
today about the synthetic drug epidemic and my bill, H.R. 2851, 
the Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues 
(SITSA) Act of 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;Synthetic drug abuse has crippled communities across this 
Nation, leading to countless tragedies in places like my 
district. This year, Syracuse area hospitals saw a record 
number of overdoses due to synthetic drug abuse. In May, over 
15 individuals had overdosed on synthetic drugs and were taken 
to the ER in the span of 24 hours. Unfortunately, stories like 
this have become the new normal. First responders and emergency 
room physicians across the Nation have seen incredible 
increases in calls due to synthetic overdoses, which is why 
they wholeheartedly support my legislation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;Toxic, synthetic drugs are designed to mimic street drugs 
like marijuana, LSD, cocaine, ecstasy and other hard drugs. 
They can be more potent than the real thing and oftentimes are 
more deadly. Unfortunately, when law enforcement encounters and 
begins to combat a specific synthetic drug compound, 
manufacturers of these substances are able to slightly alter 
the chemical structure of the drug. This puts law enforcement 
at a serious disadvantage, leaving them constantly one step 
behind. As a former U.S. attorney, but more importantly, as a 
father, getting these drugs off the streets and out of the 
hands of our loved ones remains a top priority for me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;Right before I introduced the bill, I met with a 
constituent in my district, Teresa Woolson, whose son was 
tragically killed by a synthetic drug identified as XLR-11. 
Unfortunately for Teresa, the drug that killed her son managed 
to remain legal and on the streets for 4 years after his death, 
until it was finally added to the controlled substances list. 
This is unacceptable and these families deserve to see justice.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;The potency and danger of synthetic drugs do not only 
threaten users, we are now seeing local law enforcement and 
first responders put in harm's way simply by coming in contact 
with these often lethal substances. Numerous cases across the 
country have resulted in emergency personnel becoming gravely 
ill and even dying while responding synthetic overdoses. The 
threats synthetic drugs pose to our communities and law 
enforcement must be stopped. H.R. 2851 takes a big step towards 
eradicating these harmful substances and protecting our 
communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;The SITSA Act will give local, State, and Federal law 
enforcement the necessary tools to target synthetic substances 
and the criminals who traffic them. Specifically, this 
legislation will create a new schedule to the Controlled 
Substances Act and establish a mechanism by which synthetic 
analogues can be temporarily or permanently added to that 
schedule in as little as 30 days after the chemical composition 
is determined by the Attorney General. The new schedule, 
Schedule A, will also add 13 synthetic fentanyls that have been 
identified by the DEA as an immediate threat to public health 
and safety. These synthetics have been confirmed as the cause 
of death in at least 162 cases in the United States. Finally, 
the bill maintains firm penalties for foreign manufacturing and 
importation and provides a multistep sentencing process which 
includes application of existing Federal guidelines. The goal 
of this legislation is to not only prevent drug abuse, but to 
facilitate proper research so that we may better understand 
these chemical compounds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;The stories of synthetic drug abuse are in no way limited 
to my area of the country; this is a nationwide epidemic. I 
respectfully ask this subcommittee to consider the SITSA Act 
because every moment we fail to act; another person is effected 
by synthetic drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;This summer, the Judiciary Committee unanimously passed 
this bipartisan legislation. We have worked with Members on 
both sides of the aisle as well as stakeholders across the law 
enforcement and health communities. I welcome your comments and 
amendments so that we can make this bill a powerful tool in 
eradicating these harmful substances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. John Katko"&gt;    Again, I thank you for allowing me to testify this morning 
and urge this subcommittee to take action on H.R. 2851.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING"&gt;    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. 
Keating, for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Keating&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;Let me just go off my notes and try and speak from the 
heart. Before I was a Member of Congress, I was a DA for 12 
years. Started a task force. Now, it's over a decade and a half 
on--at the time, heroin task force, but it was the result of my 
work as a DA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;We would go to unattended deaths. We would find out that 
the person there had no criminal record. They started their 
addiction with prescription drugs, went to heroin--it was just 
cheaper, more available, believe it or not--and then they died.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;I consoled parents who lost the child. I worked with 
grandparents who were raising their children. In my own family, 
I lost a cousin to an overdose right after he was coming out of 
detox, the most dangerous time. On a brighter note, I have 
another family member a decade and a half in recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;So I've seen this first hand. I've dealt with it in my 
district now. Since we are sharing that, one of my communities 
I share with Representative Kennedy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;At Fall River, Mass., they are on pace for over a 
thousand--just this one city over a thousand overdoses this 
year and over a hundred deaths. It is the effect of fentanyl 
and carfentanyl in our area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;In my district, I have four of the five leading counties in 
terms of opioid deaths.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;I want to thank this committee, though, for the work they 
have done with the CARA Act, with 21st Century Cures. You are 
working--I think that work is at risk if we backtrack on the 
availability of treatment through the ACA or another source 
because, as you know, 34 percent of the people before then did 
not have the guarantee of that treatment, which is important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;Eighteen percent didn't have the coverage for mental health 
treatment that is necessary as well. In the Medicaid 
expansion--those States that did it--there is now 11 million 
low-income Americans covered by this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;I also want to thank you on efforts that we've worked on a 
bipartisan basis. I worked on efforts with the STOP Act, which 
was part of this committee. I hope that it moves forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;Some of that is being done administratively where we look 
at making our drugs that are there tamper resistant--abuse 
resistant. Cosponsoring a Saves Act also, which allows a 
coprescription of Naloxone that is there--it solves the problem 
for the medical community and work with the veterans in terms 
of making sure they are educated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;I just heard my colleague talk about the fact that we deal 
with this in three ways. The interdiction is limited. I just 
had a private meeting, since I am on Homeland Security, in my 
office with the leaders in terms of Customs and Border Patrol 
and what is going on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;It is limited because so much of it's increased through the 
mail, through Fed Ex, through UPS. Very hard to deal with in 
that respect, although we should do what we can to do it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;Prevention is important, obviously, in terms of medical-
assisted treatment and dealing with the middle school 
population.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;Let me just conclude with this, because I was up last night 
thinking what I was going to say to you today. About 7 years 
ago when I got here, four Members of Congress, myself included, 
sat down with the FDA and people just to air out some real 
concerns. Only myself and Representative Hal Rogers are still 
here from that group.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;At the end of listening to us, all these experts came and 
they said, Congressman, you don't understand--you don't 
understand about medicine. You don't understand about medical 
treatment. We are there to deal with some pain and, you know, 
that is part of our reason.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;And I said--and I slammed the table and I said, you don't 
understand about pain--the pain of losing a son or a daughter, 
a grandchild. The pain of families--the pain of what it does to 
your income and work when this happens. That kind of pain 
doesn't go away.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;And we haven't progressed enough from that, frankly. It is 
great for this committee. It is great, I think, for myself to 
take whatever expert advice we can.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;But on this issue, people are depending on us. We've got to 
create the urgency and deal with it ourselves. We can't rely on 
other people to do it. In many cases, we are the court of last 
resort.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Keating"&gt;We can do this. We can work together and we can make sure 
it can be done. But let's do it ourselves and let us take that 
leadership, and I want to thank you for the leadership you've 
shown in this, and I plan to work with you any way I can.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. William R. Keating&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. William R. Keating"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. William R. Keating"&gt;Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and other 
distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify about this critical issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. William R. Keating"&gt;Dating back to my time as District Attorney, I have 
witnessed the devastation of the opioid crisis for nearly two 
decades. Countless families in my area have felt the effects, 
including my own. I have been called to sites of unattended 
deaths resulting from overdose. I have consoled parents who 
have lost a child to an overdose. I have worked with 
grandparents who are raising their grandchildren because of 
addiction. And all of this was before I got to Congress 7 years 
ago, when the number of opioid-related deaths was 45 percent 
lower than it is today. Today, we even have entire facilities 
dedicated to babies born addicted to opioids. As the members of 
this committee know, we cannot continue only to talk about this 
at arm's length. This goes beyond just numbers or statistics. 
People are feeling real pain. And we are losing an entire 
generation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. William R. Keating"&gt;The district I represent in Congress includes four of the 
top five counties in Massachusetts by opioid death rate. 
Further, Fall River, Massachusetts, a city I represent along 
with Congressman Kennedy, is projected to see at least 1,000 
opioid overdoses and over 100 deaths in 2017 alone. This is a 
horrible scourge for my constituents, and as evinced by the 
need for this hearing, a tragic epidemic nationwide.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. William R. Keating"&gt;To begin, I thank this committee for their work guiding the 
House through enactment of two important laws, laws which laid 
meaningful groundwork for progress in battling the opioid 
crisis. The strategy outlined in the Comprehensive Addiction 
and Recovery Act (CARA) and the $1 billion in funding included 
in the 21st Century Cures Act have been significant steps in 
the right direction. More people have access to treatment, more 
health professionals understand early signs of addiction, and 
the number of opioid prescriptions has declined. However, some 
of the health legislation we have seen this year places this 
progress at risk.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. William R. Keating"&gt;Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), an estimated 34 
percent of insurance plans did not cover treatment for opioid 
use and other substance use disorders, and 18 percent did not 
provide coverage for any mental health conditions. The ACA 
required insurance policies to include this coverage. 
Similarly, the law's Medicaid expansion provided access to 
treatment for substance use disorders to 11 million low-income 
Americans. In fact, at an estimated $60 billion in coverage for 
behavioral health services each year, Medicaid is the largest 
source of funding for mental healthcare in the country--
including services related to substance use disorders. Efforts 
to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid 
place this coverage at grave risk. Accordingly, I am committed 
to defending the Affordable Care Act and preserving access to 
addiction treatment for all Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. William R. Keating"&gt;Aside from these concerns, I am encouraged that we do find 
consensus elsewhere. For example, we agree the solution to this 
crisis requires a multipronged approach. Last Congress, I 
introduced three bipartisan pieces of legislation aimed at 
combatting the opioid crisis from three different fronts. The 
first, the Stop Tampering of Prescription Pills Act, calls on 
the Food and Drug Administration to facilitate the creation of 
tamper-resistant formulations for commonly misused pain 
medication. The second, the Coprescribing Saves Lives Act, 
encourages physicians to coprescribe naloxone alongside opioid 
prescriptions and make naloxone more widely available in 
Federal health settings. The legislation also authorizes a 
grants program to funds State-level efforts to encourage the 
establishment of coprescribing guidelines, assist in the 
purchase of naloxone, fund training for health professionals 
and patients, and support patient copays. Last, the Safe 
Prescribing for Veterans Act outlines a common-sense plan to 
decrease opioid overuse among veterans by establishing a pain 
management continuing education requirement for opioid 
prescribers affiliated with the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues as I reintroduce 
these initiatives this Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. William R. Keating"&gt;    We in this House are constantly learning about innovative 
approaches to pain management, improved methods of treating 
addiction, and novel ideas for opioid disorder prevention and 
education. There are even technologies that function as 
alternatives to pain medications, such as spinal cord 
stimulators implanted as long-term solutions to chronic pain. I 
appear before this committee ready to work on new approaches to 
caring for those who need help and ensuring our families, our 
neighbors, and all Americans have the resources they need as 
they seek a path down the road to recovery.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. ERIK PAULSEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. ERIK PAULSEN"&gt;    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. 
Paulsen, for 3 minutes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Paulsen&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and also for this
opportunity to speak about the opioid addiction in Minnesota.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Minnesota is like the rest of the country. It is struggling 
with the crisis. It is tearing families apart through addiction 
and death and the numbers are only getting worse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Minnesota saw a 12 percent rise in opioid deaths from in 
2016 over 2015. The crisis affects Minnesotans of all 
backgrounds in rural communities, big cities, and in our 
suburbs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Just a year and a half ago in my hometown of Chanhassen, we 
saw the passing of music legend Prince due to an opioid 
overdose. In Minnesota, there are 50 opioid prescriptions 
written for every 100 patients that visit our doctors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Clearly, we need to change the culture and our delivery of 
care to stop the flow of opioids when there are proven 
alternative types of treatments that may not require those 
prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;When someone requires surgery for back pain, they can 
choose between minimally invasive surgery or the standard 
surgery that requires a long post-surgery stay in the hospital 
and powerful painkillers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;One way to reduce the dependency on opioids is to use 
procedures that are minimally invasive and do not require long 
hospital stays and opioids to dull the pain from other invasive 
procedures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;An example is minimally invasive sacroiliac, or IS, 
infusion, which has been shown to reduce the need for dangerous 
pain killers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Unfortunately, some private insurers don't cover this 
procedure, forcing people to choose the standard surgery that 
requires addictive opioids for pain management.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Instead of simply prescribing a drug for the pain, 
providers should also look to other therapies and insurers so 
they can proactively cover these therapies so that people are 
given more choices to manage their pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;We must hold providers and patients accountable and 
encourage insurers to cover more types of procedures. The 
opioid crisis also affects businesses including our local 
pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;According to the DEA, in 2014 there were 16 armed robberies 
involving stolen opioids at Minnesota pharmacies. Last year, 
that number doubled. People get hurt and die during these 
crimes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Dangerous drugs are put on the street. Businesses have to 
close their doors because of safety concerns and communities 
lose vital resources and neighbors because of addiction and the 
crime that goes with it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Earlier this year, I spoke to a mom from Maple Grove, 
Minnesota, whose son bought carfentanyl online, consumed it, 
and died.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;We need to increase funding for safety resources, for 
addicts and trained law enforcement officers to spot and stop 
opioid-related crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Paulsen"&gt;Our communities depend on access to health care and we need 
to do more to reduce the crime and death associated with opioid 
addiction if we are going to help get people--and get the care 
that they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Erik Paulsen&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Erik Paulsen"&gt;I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to 
working with you and the rest of the members on your committee 
for bipartisan solutions to the problems associated with opioid 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Erik Paulsen"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone, for 
this opportunity to speak about the opioid addiction crisis in 
Minnesota.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Erik Paulsen"&gt;Minnesota is like the rest of the United States in and 
unfortunately, it is suffering with addiction to and death from 
opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Erik Paulsen"&gt;It's a crisis tearing families apart through addiction and 
death and the numbers are only getting worse. Minnesota saw a 
12 percent rise in 2016 over 2015-with 376 opioid related 
deaths. The crisis affects Minnesotans of all backgrounds in 
rural communities, big cities, and suburbs. In April 2016, in 
my hometown of Chanhassen, we saw the passing of music legend 
Prince due to an opioid overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Erik Paulsen"&gt;In Minnesota, there are 50 opioid prescriptions written for 
every 100 patients that visit our doctors. Clearly we need to

surgery that requires a long post-surgery stay in the hospital 
and powerful pain killers. One way to reduce the dependency on 
opioids is to use procedures that are minimally invasive and so 
do not require long hospital stays and opioids to dull the pain 
from other invasive procedures. An example is minimally 
invasive sak-roh-il-ee-ak joint, or SI fusion, which has been

local pharmacies. According to the DEA, in 2014 there were 16 
armed robberies involving stolen opioids at Minnesota

die during these crimes, dangerous drugs are put on the street, 
businesses have to close their doors because of safety concerns

    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Erik Paulsen"&gt;Earlier this year, I spoke to a mother Maple Grove, MN 
whose son bought carylfentanyl online, consumed it, and died. 
We must increase funding for safety resources for addicts and 
train law enforcement officers to spot, and stop opioid-related 
crime. Our communities depend on access to health care, but we 
must do something to reduce the crime and death associated with 
opioid addiction if we are going to help people get and keep 
the care they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Erik Paulsen"&gt;    I thank you again, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Pallone, 
for allowing me this opportunity, and I look forward to working 
with to come up with more bipartisan solutions to the problems 
associated with opioid addiction.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Delaware, Ms. 
Rochester, for 3 minutes, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;Ms. Blunt Rochester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;I want to start off by saying as a former Deputy Secretary 
of Health and Social Services in Delaware, former Secretary of 
Labor, and community member and family member, substance abuse 
has touched my life and so many others, everything from our 
economy to our prison system to our families, from crack to 
heroin to all forms of opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;And in many ways, Delaware reflects our Nation. Geography--
we are urban and rural. We mirror the country in terms of 
demographics and, unfortunately, like the rest of the Nation we 
are facing a growing opiate crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;Just yesterday, our death toll from this horrible disease 
rose to 171 Delawareans for the year. That might not seem like 
a lot to some, but to put that into perspective, that many 
deaths in a State the size of Delaware made us number 13 per 
capita in the country last year for opioid overdose deaths, 
according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;This public health crisis is prevalent in districts across 
the country, and Congress has the opportunity to impact it in a 
meaningful way and take action.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;This is why it's so important to tackle this issue on a 
bipartisan basis. The opioid addiction has taken a strong hold 
across the Nation and we must work together to combat the flow 
of drugs throughout our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;This is a problem for all States but particularly on the 
East Coast, where compact States means that none of us can act 
alone. Drug trafficking doesn't stop at Delaware's borders with 
Maryland or Pennsylvania or New Jersey, and neither does this 
public health crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;Delaware and our neighbors have made great progress through 
collaborative programs like HIDTA and prescription drug 
monitoring programs. But that should just be the beginning. We 
aren't doing enough.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;But it is also important to remember that there are people 
in Delaware and in all of our communities making a difference. 
Every day on the ground for people, for families, and in 
neighbourhoods they are combatting this crisis on the ground.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;I want to thank all those people who are fighting, whether 
they are in public health, whether they are doctors, first 
responders, the faith community, community groups, families--
all those who are doing their part to make sure that we tackle 
this issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER"&gt;We in Congress need to join them. I hope that we in 
Congress will also continue to work together and address this 
epidemic by providing resources for prevention, support for 
recovery, and access to care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. JUDY CHU, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROMTHE STATE OF CALIFORNIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. JUDY CHU"&gt;    And Ms. Chu, you are recognized for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Chu&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;Mr. Chair, I want to start by thanking you for
allowing Members to testify on this issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;Today, I would like to draw the subcommittee's attention to 
the significant needs of those who have sought help for 
addiction, completed treatment and are just beginning to live 
in recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;These individuals often choose to live in sober living 
facilities after completing treatment in order to ease into the 
routines of daily life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;However, there are far too many sober homes that are 
commonly unequipped to handle patients at risk of overdose or 
do not employ staff with specialty training for individuals in 
recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;Worst of all, some of these facilities do not encourage 
recovery at all but exploit vulnerable people recently released 
from treatment in order to collect insurance payments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;This could mean life or death for people like Tyler from my 
district of Pasadena, California, who died from an overdose 
after his sober home didn't recognize the symptoms of his 
overdose and didn't have Naloxone, the medication that can 
reverse an overdose. Tyler was only 23 years old.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;Unfortunately, this is not an isolated issue. I have heard 
from advocates in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Ohio, and 
countless others who are concerned for their friends and 
neighbors living in unregulated sober living facilities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;    I would like to submit for the record a New York Times 
article from 2015 and a May 2017 report from the Department of 
Justice outlining abuse and fraud at sober homes in New York 
and Florida.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Without objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Chu&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;These reports describe sober living facilities
that lacked access to Naloxone, ordered unnecessary tests on 
residents to exhaust their insurance benefits, and required 
residents to relapse and reenter treatment so resident 
directors could claim some of the Medicaid benefits.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;Licensing for recovery residences or sober living 
facilities vary substantially from State to State, and there 
are facilities in every State operating without licenses at 
all.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;Further, oversight of these facilities is minimal so 
patients and families with loved ones in recovery struggle to 
distinguish good actors from bad ones.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;For some individuals, they may not discover their facility 
is negligent until it is too late. That is why this week I plan 
to introduce the Ensuring Quality Sober Living Act. My 
legislation would require the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration to develop a set of best practices for 
residential recovery facilities so patients, families, and 
States can distinguish quality sober living facilities from 
sites that are fraudulent or unequipped to offer appropriate 
assistance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;The bill would require SAMHSA to disseminate these best 
practices to each State and authorize the agency to provide 
technical assistance and support.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Chu"&gt;My bill would require States to help SAMHSA set up criteria 
to distinguish quality sober living facilities. These best 
practices to allow the guidelines for common sense measures 
like requiring that all fees and charges be explained to 
residents before entering a binding agreement and that Naloxone 
is available and accessible and that staff and residents are 
trained to use it in emergencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Judy Chu"&gt;My bill would allow States, who are struggling to address 
the opioid crisis, to work with SAMHSA to help set up criteria 
to designate quality sober living facilities. These best 
practices will follow the guidelines that have been published 
by the National Association of Recovery Residences, which 
provide benchmarks for various levels of quality facilities. 
These benchmarks include common-sense measures like requiring 
that all fees and charges be explained to residents before 
entering a binding agreement, that paid work performed at the 
facility be completely voluntary and not impede the recovery 
process, and that Naloxone is available and accessible, and 
that staff and residents are trained to use it in emergencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Judy Chu"&gt;    Thank you again for taking the time to hear from your 
colleagues on ways to address this growing crisis. I ask that 
as you continue to consider legislation on the opioid epidemic, 
you include ways to address the needs of those newly in 
recovery.

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. JACKIE WALORSKI"&gt;Mrs. Walorski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. JACKIE WALORSKI"&gt;Indiana is no different than any other State that we've 
heard from sitting here. Pain is the number-one reason why 
Americans seek health care, the number-one cause of disability 
that costs the U.S. economy more than $600 billion in direct 
health care costs and lost productivity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. JACKIE WALORSKI"&gt;The veteran population is particularly impacted by the 
chronic pain crisis with more than 50 percent of the VA patient 
responding and reporting to chronic pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. JACKIE WALORSKI"&gt;We can reduce demand by more effectively treating chronic 
pain and providing better access to FDA-approved Nonopioid 
pharmaceuticals, advanced medical devices, and integrated 
alternative therapies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. JACKIE WALORSKI"&gt;As we develop policy, we should, number one, recognize the 
importance of a multi disciplinary approach. Chronic pain is 
pervasive and is largely unaddressed by the public health care

    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. JACKIE WALORSKI"&gt;Promote--and number two, promote cutting-edge pain research

evidence is urgently needed to help clinicians and patients 
make informed decisions about how to manage chronic pain safely 
and understand the causes and mechanisms of chronic pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. JACKIE WALORSKI"&gt;Advanced best practices and pain management within 
Medicare. In 2016, one in three Medicare Part D beneficiaries 
received a prescription opioid. The GAO should conduct a study 
of the coverage options offered within Medicare for evidence-
based pain management as an alternative to opioid 
prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. JACKIE WALORSKI"&gt;Also, there should be a review of the graduate medical 
education programs' training and education of providers on pain 
management and opioid prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. JACKIE WALORSKI"&gt;I hope these ideas will be helpful in future planning

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Jackie Walorski&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Jackie Walorski"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back my time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Jackie Walorski"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess and Ranking Member Green, for 
holding this hearing on the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Jackie Walorski"&gt;America is facing two interrelated public health epidemics: 
chronic pain and opioid addiction, misuse, and abuse. A long-
term solution to the opioid epidemic will not be achieved 
without addressing the challenge of appropriately treating 
chronic pain. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), 100 
million Americans suffer from chronic pain. Pain is the number 
one reason why Americans seek health care, the number one cause 
of disability, and costs the US economy more than $600 billion 
in direct healthcare costs and lost productivity. The veteran 
population is particularly impacted by the chronic pain crisis 
with more than 50 percent of VA patients reporting chronic 
pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Jackie Walorski"&gt;Thousands of lives are lost to both opioid-related overdose 
and chronic pain-related suicide. Reducing the supply of or 
access to opioids will not, by itself, solve this crisis. 
Currently, 80 percent of heroin users started with prescription 
opioids. We must reduce demand for them by more effectively 
treating chronic pain, and providing better access to FDA-
approved nonopioid pharmaceuticals, advanced medical devices, 
and integrated alternative therapies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Jackie Walorski"&gt;As we look to develop policy, we should:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Jackie Walorski"&gt;1. Recognize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach 
to pain management as a key component of overcoming the opioid 
crisis. Chronic pain is pervasive and largely unaddressed 
public health crisis. Solving it is a crucial part of solving 
the larger opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Jackie Walorski"&gt;2. Promote cutting edge pain research to encourage 
effective opioid alternatives. High-quality evidence is 
urgently needed to help clinicians and patients make informed 
decisions about how to manage chronic pain safely and 
understand the causes and mechanisms of chronic pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Jackie Walorski"&gt;3. Advance best practices in pain management in Medicare. 
Currently 1 in 3 Medicare beneficiaries are prescribed an 
opioid. The GAO should conduct a study of the coverage options 
for evidence-based pain management. In addition, there should 
be a study conducted on the Graduate Medical Education program 
on the training and education that providers receive regarding 
pain management.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Jackie Walorski"&gt;    I hope these ideas will be helpful in future policy 
discussions to reduce the abuse of opioids in our communities. 
Thank you for the time, and I yield back.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL M. DONOVAN, JR., A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. DANIEL M. DONOVAN"&gt;    Mr. Donovan, you are recognized for 3 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Donovan&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before 
you today to share my thoughts on the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;This year alone, there have been more than 100 reported 
overdose deaths in my district. That number would be much 
higher if it weren't for the 574 Naloxone saves reported by our 
local hospitals and the New York City Police Department.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;Before I came to Congress, I served as district attorney of 
Richmond County, which comprises of Staten Island, New York. 
Based on that experience, my time in Congress, and input from 
local experts like the Staten Island Partnership for Community 
Wellness, I support a three-tiered approach for this problem 
that addresses education, treatment, and enforcement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;Targeted education campaigns can teach the next generation 
of potential users about the dangers of substance abuse 
including particularly sinister compounds like fentanyl.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;Treatment is, of course, crucial. We have learned that 
recovery is a cycle and relapses will happen. Our policies 
should reflect that reality. Our society now understands that 
addiction is a medical illness and not a criminal act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;Let us help the addicted, not punish them. To that end, 
consistently appropriating grants for local treatment programs 
is the most effective way to help end the cycle of addiction 
from the Federal level.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;Lastly, we cannot ignore the importance of enforcement, 
particularly against traffickers. My Comprehensive Fentanyl 
Control Act would ban pill presses that traffickers use to 
create their deadly fentanyl-laced cocktails. It would also 
update sentencing guidelines to reflect the fact that a few 
grains of--few grains of rice worth of fentanyl can kill an 
individual.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;I firmly believe that the experts on the ground are best 
equipped to tailor their approaches to meet their communities' 
needs. It is our job as legislators to provide them with the 
resources necessary to accomplish their mission.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;Legislation like the 21st Century Cures Act and the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which I championed to 
constituents back in my district, are exactly the right 
approach.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Donovan"&gt;Thank you again for the opportunity to share my thoughts. I 
look forward to working with the subcommittee and to continuing 
to address this national crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. VICKY HARTZLER"&gt;Representative Hartzler, you are recognized for 3 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. VICKY HARTZLER"&gt;    Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;But only use two.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Mrs. Hartzler. And thank you for this opportunity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;In Missouri, the scourge of drug abuse is a growing problem 
and it will take all of us to help solve it. I have heard of 
too many stories of families torn apart and livelihoods in 
tatters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;To this end, I ask the committee to explore ways to make it 
easier for faith-based organizations to offer addiction 
treatment programs. I have seen firsthand the power of faith-
based recovery programs in treating addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;In my own district, I have visited multiple Christian 
organizations that have high rates of success in treating 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;By centering on a community of faith, these organizations 
provide support structures that stay with recovering addicts 
their entire lives. In some cases, they also provide services 
that aren't available in other addiction recovery programs in 
the area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;For instance, one religious organization in my district 
provides housing for both mothers and their children while the 
mothers seek treatment for their addiction. No doubt their 
recovery is greatly facilitated by the additional support of 
their children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I firmly believe faith-based recovery programs are part of 
a holistic approach to treat both the body and spirit. They 
provide emotional and spiritual support for individuals and 
their families during the darkest times and I ask the committee 
to seriously consider making available and expanding any and 
all funding opportunities to faith-based organizations 
providing addiction, treatment, and programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;In addition, on a second topic, the IMD exclusion caps the 
number of beds mental health facilities receiving Medicaid can 
have at 16. Multiple health care groups have come into my 
office saying this blocks critical access to treatment for 
people who need inpatient treatment for addiction including 
some of society's most vulnerable--veterans, pregnant addicted 
women, women with dependent children, and youth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

today about the opioid crisis that's facing our Nation, and I 
appreciate the committee continuing to look for solutions to 
this ongoing epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Subcommittee on Health"&gt;In Missouri, the scourge of drug abuse is a growing 
problem, and it will take all of us to help solve it. I have 
heard too many stories of families torn apart and livelihoods 
in tatters. Over one-twelfth of U.S. and Missouri adults report 
substance use disorders, and this rate is even higher among 
young adults. As we continue to address this problem, we must 
consider all avenues available. To that end, I ask the 
committee to explore ways to make it easier for faith-based 
organizations to offer addiction treatment programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Subcommittee on Health"&gt;I have seen first-hand the power of faith based recovery 
programs in treating addiction. In my own district, I have 
visited multiple Christian organizations that have high rates 
of success in treating addiction. By centering on a community 
of faith, these organizations provide support structures that 
stay with recovering addicts their entire lives. In some cases, 
they also provide services that aren't available in other 
addiction recovery programs in the area. For instance, one 
religious organization in my district provides housing for both 
mothers and their children while the mothers seek treatment for 
their addiction. No doubt, their recovery is greatly 
facilitated by the additional support for their children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Subcommittee on Health"&gt;I firmly believe faith based recovery programs are part of 
a holistic approach that treat both the body and spirit. They 
provide emotional and spiritual support for individuals and 
their families during their darkest times. These religious 
organizations provide a foundation for recovery that medication 
assisted treatment alone cannot. It's the love and power of God 
and the life purpose He gives that ultimately provides a 
sustainable path to recovery for many individuals. I ask the 
committee to seriously consider making available and expanding 
any and all funding opportunities to faith based organizations 
providing addiction treatment programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Subcommittee on Health"&gt;Repeal the IMD Exclusion&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Subcommittee on Health"&gt;    The IMD exclusion caps the number of beds mental health 
facilities receiving Medicaid can have at 16. Multiple health

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK"&gt; Chair thanks the gentlelady. Gentleman from
Pennsylvania is recognized for 3 minutes, but only use 2, 
please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fitzpatrick&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;As this committee is aware, drug overdoses involving 
prescription opioids and heroin have nearly quadrupled since 
1999 and are now the leading cause of accidental death in this 
Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Substance abuses costs our country over $600 billion 
annually. In my home State of Pennsylvania, drug-related deaths 
and opioid addiction rates were amongst the highest in the 
Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Within one year, Pennsylvania's opioid-related deaths rose 
20 percent while my district's increased by 50 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Mr. Chairman, this epidemic is costing us both resources 
and precious lives, like my constituent, Carlos Castellanos. 
Carlos, in Falls Township, always loved sharing his talents and 
love of music by playing the guitar and drums at school for a 
local church group.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;However, like so many around the Nation, Carlos got 
involved with drugs during his time at school and even spent 
some time in jail. But with the strength and support of his 
family he began receiving treatment and his life improved. He 
helped others by volunteering at a recovery home and he brought 
people suffering in similar situations to treatment programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Last December, Carlos walked his mother, Pamela, down the 
aisle for her wedding. He was getting ready to get back to 
school. He had a stead job and a girlfriend.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;It would seem that many of Carlos' battles with addiction 
were heading in the right direction, a needed point of hope in 
the war that has caused so much devastation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Then, Mr. Chairman, on December 23rd, just days before 
Christmas, two police detectives showed up at Pamela's door to 
tell her the devastating news that no mother can ever prepare 
for.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Carlos overdosed on a drug laced with fentanyl and was 
unable to be saved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Carlos' life and his death cast a bright 
light on the fact that addiction is nothing short of a chronic 
disease and I would also like to bring to this attention what 
my colleague did--the so-called Institute for Mental Disease, 
or IMD, exclusion is a longstanding policy that prohibits the 
Federal Medicaid matching funds to States for services rendered 
to Medicaid enrollees who suffer from substance use disorder 
for mental health treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Some States, like my State of Pennsylvania, have used the 
in lieu of services provision allowing for inpatient treatment 
but with limitations on population size, facility size and 
length of stay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;These limitations disproportionately affect those using 
Medicaid, blocking access to treatment for people who need 
inpatient treatment for addiction including some of society's 
most vulnerable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Fitzpatrick"&gt;I urge my colleagues to adopt the Road to Recovery Act, a 
bill I introduced which addresses real-world concerns expressed 
by local lawmakers, community leaders, and health care 
professionals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;I would like to start off by thanking Chairman Burgess, 
Ranking Member Green, and members of the Subcommittee on Health 
for holding this hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Mr. Chairman, drug overdoses involving prescription opioids 
and heroin have nearly quadrupled since 1999 and are now the 
leading cause of accidental death. Substance abuse costs our 
country over $600 billion annually. In my home State of 
Pennsylvania, drug-related deaths and opioid addiction rates 
were among the highest in the country. Within 1 year, 
Pennsylvania's opioid-related deaths rose 20 percent while my 
district's increased by 50 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;This epidemic is costing us both resources and precious 
lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Carlos Castellanos of Falls Township, Bucks County always 
loved sharing his talents and love of music by playing the 
guitar and drums at school and for local church groups.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;However, like so many around the Nation, Carlos got 
involved with drugs during his time in school and even spent 
some time in jail. But, with the strength and support of his 
family, he began receiving treatment and his life improved. He 
helped others by volunteering at a recovery house and he 
brought people suffering in similar situations to treatment 
programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;In early December, Carlos walked his mother, Pamela, down 
the aisle for her wedding. He was getting ready to go back to 
school, he had a steady job, and a girlfriend. It would seem to 
many that Carlos' battle with addiction was heading in the 
right direction--a needed point of hope in a war that's caused 
so much devastation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Then, on December 23rd, just days before Christmas, two 
police detectives showed up at Pamela's door to tell her the 
devastating news that no mother can prepare for: Carlos had 
overdosed on a drug laced with fentanyl and was unable to be 
saved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Carlos' life--and his death--cast a bright 
light on the fact that addiction is nothing short of a chronic 
disease.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;I share this story with Members of this chamber because we 
must realize that we have treat the whole person, not just the 
addiction. We must focus on the underlying issues driving 
people to seek opioids, while increasing the accessibility and 
affordability for prevention, education, treatment, and 
recovery of this disease. The so-called Institutions for Mental 
Diseases--or IMD--exclusion is a long-standing policy that 
prohibits the Federal Medicaid matching funds to States for 
services rendered to Medicaid enrollees who suffer from 
substance use disorder and mental health treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;Some States--including my home State of Pennsylvania--have 
used an ``in lieu of services'' provision allowing for 
inpatient treatment, but with limitations on patient 
population, facility size, and length of stay. These 
limitations disproportionately affect those under Medicaid--
blocking access to treatment for people who need inpatient 
treatment for addiction including some of society's most 
vulnerable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;That is why I introduced bipartisan legislation that 
eliminates the IMD exclusion for substance use disorder and 
help States expand access to inpatient addiction services for 
Medicaid enrollees in a fiscally responsible manner while not 
intruding on their flexibility to implement care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;The Road to Recovery Act addresses real-world concerns 
expressed by local lawmakers, community leaders and healthcare 
professionals in my district who endeavor to tackle this 
epidemic each day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;I urge my colleagues to learn more about this issue and 
support this bipartisan bill, but also to recommit ourselves to 
addressing the addiction crisis and fighting for those who 
suffer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Brian K. Fitzpatrick"&gt;    I yield back.

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;In speaking with constituents about the opioid epidemic, I 
have learned firsthand the impact this epidemic is having on 
our communities in Pennsylvania. It is affecting families and 
individuals of all ages, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Throughout my congressional district and throughout this 
Nation there are parents, teachers, athletes, doctors, 
teenagers, and seniors struggling with addiction, a disease 
that has no boundaries when it comes to who it affects.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;These families and these individuals are why we must 
continue our work to pass legislation like the Comprehensive 
Addiction Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act, two 
bills I supported that are both now law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;These bipartisan bills are helping our communities through 
increasing access to treatment and expanding prevention, 
education, and intervention efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;In the communities I represent, a recurring sentiment I 
have heard was, you would not believe how much treatment costs. 
The cost of treatment and recovery is, indeed, crippling for so 
many families, even for individuals who have insurance--$35,000 
for a 30-day at a treatment center, $10,000 for a 10-day detox, 
hundreds of dollars spent on flights to recovery programs 
across the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Families are being forced to refinance their homes, parents 
are taking on second jobs, and retirees are reentering the 
workforce to help pay for treatment for a family member 
struggling with addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Those seeking help should not be faced with insurmountable 
costs. To help individuals provide assistance--financial 
assistance to family members struggling with addiction, I have 
added my name as a cosponsor to H.R. 1575, the Addiction 
Recovery through Family Health Accounts Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Under current law, individuals can only use funds in their 
health savings account, flexible spending account, or health 
reimbursement arrangement to pay for addiction treatment for 
their spouse or dependents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;This bill will give individuals the option to use funds 
from these accounts to help family members receiving drug 
treatment, be it a niece, grandfather, cousin, in-law, et 
cetera. This legislation is a step in the right direction in 
alleviating the financial burden of substance abuse treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;I am proud of the work the committee has done to help those 
facing this epidemic and I am committed to continuing this 
work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Ryan A. Costello&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Ryan A. Costello"&gt;I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Ryan A. Costello"&gt;In speaking with constituents about the opioid epidemic, I 
have learned firsthand the impact this epidemic is having on 
our communities in Pennsylvania--it is affecting families and 
individuals of all ages, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Ryan A. Costello"&gt;Throughout my Congressional district and throughout this 
Nation, there are parents, teachers, athletes, doctors, 
teenagers, and seniors struggling with addition--a disease that 
truly knows no boundaries when it comes to who it affects.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Ryan A. Costello"&gt;These families, these individuals are why we must continue 
our work to pass legislation like the Comprehensive Addiction 
and Recovery Act, and the 21st Century Cures Act--two pieces of 
legislation I supported that are both now law. These bipartisan 
bills are helping our communities through increasing access to 
treatment, and expanding prevention, education, and 
intervention efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Ryan A. Costello"&gt;In the communities I represent, a recurring sentiment I've 
heard was, ``you wouldn't believe how much money we've spent.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Ryan A. Costello"&gt;The cost of treatment and recovery is crippling, even for 
individuals who have insurance $35,000 for a 30-day stay at a 
treatment center. $10,000 for a 10-day detox. Hundreds of 
dollars spent on flights to recovery programs across the 
country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Ryan A. Costello"&gt;Families are being forced to refinance their homes, parents 
are taking on second jobs, and retirees are re-entering the 
workforce to help pay for treatment for a family member 
struggling with addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Ryan A. Costello"&gt;Those seeking help should not be faced with these

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. KEITH J. ROTHFUS, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. KEITH J. ROTHFUS"&gt;    The Chair recognizes the final gentleman from Pennsylvania 
for 3 minutes, but only use 2.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this
important hearing today for Members across the country to come 
and testify about this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;I think it is interesting that you have had three 
Pennsylvanians right in a row that represents the geography of 
Pennsylvania--eastern, middle, and western. Certain, 
communities in western Pennsylvania are among the hardest hit 
in our national opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;There has been a staggering amount of overdose deaths 
specifically in my district. In 2016, Allegheny County had 648 
individuals lose their lives from heroin or opioid-related 
overdoses. Last year, that number was 4,342 in Pennsylvania 
alone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;According to a recent article in the Pittsburgh Post 
Gazette in 2016, the number of overdose deaths in Pennsylvania 
was four times the number of deaths caused by car accidents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;In other recent reports, three people in my district were 
revived by Narcan after each overdosed at a convenience store. 
Thankfully, the first responders were able to save their lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;While it is encouraging to see that both Congress and the 
administration have taken action to address this issue, we 
still have a long way to go. From my perspective, we should be 
taking a three-pronged approach to combatting the epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;We must implement measures to prevent addiction. We must 
treat addiction once it has taken hold over someone. Finally, 
we must vigorously enforce the laws on the books to stop drug 
traffickers from spreading their poison into our communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;To help combat this, I led an effort to include language in 
the landmark Comprehensive Opioid Reduction Act that will help 
ensure our veterans who are at significant risk to have access 
to the specialized program they need--program that they need to 
prevent or overcome opioid addiction. This is one positive step 
in the right direction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;Another area where Congress should focus, one of which is 
of specific interest to me, is to increase and strengthen our 
partnership with Mexico, especially through the State 
Department's Merida Initiative.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;Our neighbor to the south has suffered a horrific level of 
murder at the hands of drug cartels. By increasing our 
cooperation with Mexico, we can help them defeat the cartels 
that caused so much pain both there and here in the U.S.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;Often overlooked is the fact that many of the narcotics 
that Mexican cartels traffic end up in the hands of Americans. 
Furthermore, increasing security at ports of entry through 
increased use of technology, cameras, and manpower is 
absolutely necessary to interdicting drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;Pending legislation like Chairman McCaul's Border Security 
for America Act will do just that. Another bipartisan bill that 
I hope will end the crisis was introduced with Congress Collin 
Peterson, H.R. 3526. I look forward to that moving forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Keith J. Rothfus"&gt;Again, I sincerely thank you for the opportunity to testify 
before the committee this morning on an issue that greatly 
affects the constituents in my district.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;[Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;Good morning Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and 
honorable Members of this vital committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;I thank you for this special opportunity to come before 
you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;I am here because, in 2016, 650 people in the St. Louis 
metropolitan area died from an opioid overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;I am here because that number of needless, tragic deaths 
has quadrupled since 2007.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;I am here because the number of annual opioid overdose 
deaths in the community that I represent is now more than three 
times the number of homicides.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;I am here because this Congress must summon our national 
courage to finally confront the menace of opioid addiction and 
opioid overdoses as an urgent public health emergency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;First, incarcerating people does very little to get at the 
underlying causes of this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;We absolutely should not condone criminals who are peddling 
heroin, fentanyl, carfentanil and other deadly drug 
combinations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;But just putting someone behind bars who has an addiction 
doesn't solve that person's problem. In fact, it is a huge 
waste of scarce taxpayer dollars that would be much better 
spent on treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;Indeed, people who go to jail and are then released--if 
they are not given treatment--are at high risk of re-using and 
are also at a very high risk of a life-threatening overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;I strongly believe in the value of life-saving and life-
renewing services offered by community-based nonprofits that 
provide treatment for substance abuse disorders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;We know that evidence-based treatment is effective and that 
when people are in treatment, they use drugs less and they 
overdose less.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;Treatment comes in many forms, but in the United States, we 
rely heavily on nonprofit community-based treatment providers 
as the safety net for treatment for low-income people and 
others who are disenfranchised, such as people who are 
homeless; many of whom are veterans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;Many of these providers rely on the Substance Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment Block Grant to survive, and I would 
wholeheartedly urge that we continue to robustly fund this 
essential program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;I do want to highlight the antiquated policy, over 50 years 
old, known as the Medicaid Institution of Mental Diseases 
Exclusion, better known as the IMD Exclusion, which bars 
Medicaid from paying for residential treatment at a facility of 
more than 16 beds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;According to the New York Times in a July 10, 2014 article 
on the negative impact of the IMD Exclusion, in some States 
this policy means that 9 out of 10 treatment beds are in 
programs too large to receive Medicaid reimbursement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;That is a huge barrier to recovery for our most needy, most 
vulnerable, poorest Americans--and it yields a two-tiered 
health care system, where only people on Medicaid lose access 
to a kind of treatment that may be clinically indicated and 
medically necessary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;Fortunately, there is growing support for ending this 
outdated policy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;For example, the National Governors Association has called 
for the elimination of the IMD Exclusion for SUD to help States 
expand access to addiction treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;And in July 2017, the President's Commission on Combating 
Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis Interim Report recommended 
that all 50 States be granted waiver approvals to eliminate 
barriers resulting from the IMD exclusion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;Perhaps most importantly in terms of legislative action, 
two key bills have been introduced in the 115th Congress that 
deserve your favorable consideration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;One is H.R. 2938, sponsored by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of 
Pennsylvania, the Road to Recovery Act, which would eliminate 
the IMD Exclusion for community-based residential treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;This is not a full repeal of the IMD Exclusion which also 
affects treatment for mental health, but rather is finely 
targeted to repeal the ban for the SUD treatment that is so 
sorely needed today amid the opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;Another bill is H.R. 2687, the Medicaid CARE Act, sponsored 
by Congressman Bill Foster of Illinois, which would turn the 
current exclusion into a cap on Medicaid reimbursement, under 
which programs could be reimbursed for residential SUD 
treatment for up to 40 beds in a program for up to 60 days.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;These are just two ways that Congress can end one of the 
most formidable barriers to treatment, and immediately help 
increase capacity and beds in every State.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay"&gt;Opioid addiction and the thousands of American lives it 
takes each year does not respect political parties, regional 
differences, racial or ethnic backgrounds or even age.it is an 
equal opportunity killer that we need to confront together as 
the People's House.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Anna G. Eshoo&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Anna G. Eshoo"&gt;Thank you for allowing me to share this time with you 
today, and I look forward to working closely with you in a 
bipartisan way to save our fellow Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Anna G. Eshoo"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Burgess and Ranking Member Green, for 
holding this listening session and giving Members of the House 
the opportunity to speak about the tragic impacts of the opioid 
crisis in their districts. This crisis claims 142 lives each 
day and has killed more people than our deadliest wars. Over 2 
million people have a prescription opioid addiction, 591,000 
have a heroin addiction, and we've seen overdose deaths triple 
in the last 13 years. Opioid abuse touches every American and 
doesn't discriminate. It affects mothers, fathers, children and 
even newborn babies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Anna G. Eshoo"&gt;I've heard from substance abuse treatment facilities in my 
congressional district and they report that the number of young 
people walking through their doors with addiction have 
strikingly increased in the past decade. This is a national 
crisis. These drugs are crippling a generation of America's 
youth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Anna G. Eshoo"&gt;President Trump appropriately announced that he would 
declare it a national emergency in August, yet it has been 62 
days since he made that announcement and no emergency 
declaration has been filed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Anna G. Eshoo"&gt;Instead, in the months since the President announced that 
he would declare the opioid crisis a national emergency, we've 
seen constant attacks on the very health care system that 
provides treatment and services to those suffering from opioid 
addiction. Medicaid and CHIP provide insurance coverage for 30 
percent of people suffering from opioid addiction. Medicaid has 
repeatedly been targeted by attempts to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act and now, through the Majority's tax reform plan. It's 
hypocritical to claim that you are committed to fighting this 
catastrophic crisis and then, at every turn, undermine the 
systems in place to treat and support those who struggle with 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Anna G. Eshoo"&gt;Last Congress, we took important steps through the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and 21st Century Cures 
Act to address and treat opioid abuse, but both of these pieces 
of legislation must secure funding from Congress. We have to 
make good on the promises we made to those Americans who suffer 
from opioid addiction and fund the programs that they rely on 
to receive the treatment and support they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Alcee L. Hastings&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;Any future approach this committee or the administration 
takes must address the entire spectrum of addiction, from 
prevention, to crisis response, to treatment and recovery. A 
law and order approach that only punishes prescription drug 
abusers does a disservice to our country and impedes progress 
toward addressing this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this important hearing 
about how the opioid epidemic is affecting communities 
nationwide. Today, I would specifically like to discuss the 
importance of repealing or reforming the Medicaid Institutions 
for Mental Diseases exclusion, which is a barrier to 
residential treatment for low-income people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, one of my counties, Palm Beach 
County, Florida, saw nearly 600 fatal overdoses last year, 
mostly related to opioids. The number of fatal opioid overdoses 
has gone up 230 percent in the past 2 years, overwhelming 
police, firefighters, hospitals, and morgues. In fact, the 
Opioid crisis has been declared a public health emergency by 
Florida Governor Rick Scott.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;Recovering drug users are flocking to South Florida from 
everywhere--drawn by a world-renowned drug treatment industry. 
Some find good centers and a path to recovery. Others fall 
victim to corrupt operators and wind up homeless, without 
money, and in the most tragic cases, dead.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;Substance use disorder (SUD) plagues the United States both 
socially and economically. The cost of substance abuse and drug 
addiction to our health care system totals $705 billion 
annually, where the emotional costs of drug addiction, on 
family, friends and those battling addiction, cannot be 
calculated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;An estimated 23.1 million Americans ages 12 or older needed 
treatment for substance abuse in 2012; however, only 2.5 
million of them actually received treatment. This shortfall is 
due primarily to the limited availability of substance use 
disorder services, particularly for those in need of 
residential care to address chronic addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;Last year, I introduced a bill to amend title XIX of the 
Social Security Act and remove the exclusion of coverage for 
services in institutions of mental diseases (IMD) under 
Medicaid. My legislation is designed to enable more Americans 
who suffer from SUD to gain equal access to the treatment 
necessary for their long-term recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;Under current law, Medicaid beneficiaries are barred access 
to community-based residential treatment for severe conditions 
due to the IMD exclusion that prohibits reimbursement care of 
patients at facilities with more than 16 beds. This nonsensical 
exclusion has effectively deterred facilities from serving 
those in dire need of care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;Eliminating the IMD exclusion will allow those who suffer 
from severe substance use disorders to have equal access to 
treatment, to achieve stable, long-term recovery, and to become 
productive members of society. The IMD elimination will also 
reduce the health, public safety, and economic consequences 
associated with addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;Addiction must be treated like any other chronic disease in 
this country, with a full continuum of treatment options based 
on the person's level of need. Current Medicaid policy hinders 
States' efforts to make this continuum available to Medicaid 
patients. My legislation would remove this Federal payment 
prohibition for behavioral health services provided in 
residential settings. Such a removal would improve access to 
substance use treatment services for millions of Americans 
across the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Alcee L. Hastings"&gt;The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and 
the Opioid Crisis Interim Report recommended that all 50 States 
be granted waiver approvals to eliminate barriers resulting 
from the IMD exclusion. Providing health care services and 
treatment resources to those who suffer from substance abuse is 
critical. In the face of this opioid epidemic, our Nation 
cannot afford to continue to bear the unintended constraints of 
50-year-old provision under Medicaid, which severely impedes 
availability and access to treatment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

this critically important hearing today, and greatly appreciate 
the opportunity to testify for your subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Subcommittee on Health for holding this important and timely&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Subcommittee on Health for holding this important and timely"&gt;I would like to thank Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member 
Green, and the other Members of the Energy and Commerce 
hearing. As an Ohio Member of Congress, and a former prosecutor 
of 25 years, I have seen firsthand the devastation caused by 
this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Subcommittee on Health for holding this important and timely"&gt;This is why I introduced my legislation, the Stem the Tide 
of Overdose Prevalence from Opiate Drugs Act of 2017, or the 
STOP OD Act. I went straight to the source to craft this bill, 
gathering input from the healthcare experts that are treating 
overdose patients on a daily basis. Cleveland Clinic, 
MetroHealth, and University Hospitals were instrumental in the 
drafting of the STOP OD Act, and endorsed it in its final form. 
The bill also has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police 
(FOP), Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA), and 
the Association of the United States Navy (AUSN). We wanted to 
know what our local communities needed, so we took their 
invaluable feedback, developed a bill that would provide 
resources where necessary, and then identified a savings 
measure to pay for those resources.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Subcommittee on Health for holding this important and timely"&gt;As a Congress, we have made progress in this arena, but 
there is more work to be done. As an original cosponsor of my 
colleague's Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015, I 
was proud when that piece of critical legislation passed both 
Chambers and was signed into law. My legislation is intended to 
be complementary to that effort. Although CARA roll-out is 
still a work in progress, more and more victims are overdosing 
every day, and our communities in Ohio are still communicating 
the need for more resources. The longer we wait to provide 
these resources, the harder this epidemic will be to address in 
the future. This is a downhill snowball and we need more 
firepower.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Subcommittee on Health for holding this important and timely"&gt;First and foremost, the STOP OD Act would make available 
grants for not more than $150 million annually for 2 years to 
provide access to life-saving Naloxone, training in the 
administration of the drug, and for coroners and medical 
examiners to test for fentanyl so we can get a better idea of 
just how deep this problem runs. Further, the bill would attach 
a fee of $80 to drug-related offenses to ensure criminals that 
are enabling the supply and demand of the drug trade pay into 
mitigating the consequences of their actions. The fee goes 
toward paying for the grant programs under this bill, and after 
2 years toward paying down the Federal debt.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Subcommittee on Health for holding this important and timely"&gt;The STOP OD Act also makes available grants for not more 
than $75 million annually for 2 years to expand educational 
efforts to prevent opiate abuse, promote treatment and 
recovery, and promote the understanding that addiction is a 
chronic disease. The educational grants, coupled with the 
Naloxone grants, total $450 million. That's the maximum grant 
allocation. In addition to the fee for drug offenses, this bill 
contains a pay-for to completely cover the maximum grant 
allocation. I worked with GAO to identify savings of at least 
$500 million by extending the current data center consolidation 
initiative. That effort is set to sunset in 2018, but the STOP 
OD Act would authorize the extension of that program for 2 more 
years, and would put those savings toward these grants, which 
will save lives and prevent further addiction. This bill works 
on the front end and the back end to address this crisis. 
Naloxone can resuscitate a victim of overdose. Meanwhile, we 
can utilize the other grant pool to educate our communities 
about the dangers of these drugs. We need a multifaceted 
approach to tackling this problem. This legislation is an 
important step toward our shared goal: ending the opiate drug 
overdose epidemic that is ravaging our great Nation. Moreover, 
I want to note that, as of this week, my legislation has a 
total of 46 bipartisan cosponsors, exactly evenly split between 
Republicans and Democrats, and spanning 20 States. It's clear 
that no matter which side of the aisle you are on, your 
community has probably been affected by this epidemic, and you 
want to take even more action to address it. That's what I am 
seeing when talking to my colleagues, and the bottom line here 
is: this bill will do some good.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Stephen F. Lynch&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Stephen F. Lynch"&gt;Thank you again for holding this hearing, and for inviting 
members outside the committee to weigh in and contribute our 
legislative proposals for your deliberation moving forward. I 
am happy to answer any questions regarding my legislation. I 
appreciate your time and consideration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Stephen F. Lynch"&gt;Good morning. Chairman Burgess, Ranking Member Green, and 
members of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, 
thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony for the 
record, and thank you for holding this important hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Stephen F. Lynch"&gt;Mr. Chairman, my State of Massachusetts was hit early on 
and has suffered greatly from this crisis. In the late 1990's, 
South Boston saw a disturbing uptick in the number of teen 
deaths, many of which were related to Oxycontin and heroin 
abuse. At the time, I worked to help establish the Cushing 
House Recovery Home for Adolescents, a drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation clinic in South Boston for teenagers. This 
initiative was just one of the many that the Commonwealth, at 
the State and local levels, has undertaken as part of a 
multifaceted approach to tackling this problem. Other 
initiatives include instituting a Prescription Monitoring 
Program, making addiction treatment facilities and services 
more accessible, increasing awareness of the scope of the 
epidemic, working with doctors to reduce the length of time 
that they prescribe opioids, and supporting innovative 
intervention efforts to reduce the rate of overdose deaths.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Stephen F. Lynch"&gt;Recent State statistics are showing that we are making an 
impact, but that we cannot afford to pull back on these 
efforts. In 2016, 2,107 citizens of Massachusetts died from an 
overdose. That level was an increase of 17 percent compared to 
2015, which saw an increase of 31 percent, and 2014 in which 
the death toll rose by 40 percent. We cannot be satisfied with 
only slowing down the rates of death: we must instead double 
down on the effective and proven initiatives that are saving 
lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Stephen F. Lynch"&gt;This brings me to the concerns I have that the Majority is 
pushing legislation that will undercut the efforts being 
undertaken both in my State and across the country. Recent 
bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act have included 
provisions that undermine Medicaid, which, according to the 
Kaiser Family Foundation, covers 3 in 10 nonelderly adults with 
opioid addiction. In addition, these bills would have allowed 
States to opt out of covering addiction treatment and the 
mental health services that are necessary to ensure that 
recovery is sustainable. Legislative actions such as these will 
only worsen the crisis and threaten the still-fragile progress 
that has been made so far. Separately, I am also concerned by 
the recent omnibus spending package that included a cut of $306 
million to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Agency (SAMHSA). These cuts in funding and in coverage will 
only worsen the epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Stephen F. Lynch"&gt;Mr. Chairman, our country lost nearly 60,000 of our fellow 
Americans to the opioid epidemic last year. We must ensure that 
we are doing everything in our power to provide those families 
and individuals who are battling addiction with the support and 
help they need to overcome this destructive disease. In 
particular, we must ensure that the programs and initiatives 
that can help them will be funded and available.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Richard M. Nolan&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;Thank you very much for the opportunity to testify.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;Chairs Walden and Burgess and Ranking Members Pallone and 
Green,&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;Thank you for inviting me to submit testimony for today's 
House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health's Member Day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;Make no mistake about it--the abuse of opioids and other 
prescription drugs has become an epidemic and a crisis of major 
proportion in this country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;According to the latest figures from the Department of 
Health and Human Services, 33,000 people die every year from 
overdoses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;And 12.5 million people misuse and abuse opioids and 
prescription drugs every year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;The fact is--in just a very few generations, we've 
increased the life expectancy in this country from less than 50 
years to nearly 80. And the Centers for Disease Control 
recently concluded that our life expectancy would be even 
higher but for this epidemic of prescription drug misuse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;With all that in mind--there is probably no more innovative 
or successful intervention program in the country than the 
community-based model being undertaken in Minnesota by CHI-St. 
Gabriel's &amp;amp; Morrison County Prescription Drug Abuse Project.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;Their model--which at my invitation has been presented to 
Congressional staff twice now--has produced tremendous results 
by bringing together doctors, nurses, pharmacists, social 
workers, law enforcement, home health and skilled nursing 
professionals and educators in the communitywide effort you 
will hear about today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;The results speak for themselves.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;In the community of Little Falls, the four participating 
pharmacies have experienced a 23 percent decrease in controlled 
substance prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;324 patients have tapered off controlled substances 
entirely, primarily through the use of suboxone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;And what that means is--370,000 fewer controlled substances 
have entered the community since the program began. At about $7 
per dose, that's a savings of about $2.6 million every year for 
patients in Morrison County.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;And what's more, in the first 8 months of the program 
alone, pain went from the number one reason people were being 
admitted to the Emergency Room--to not even in the top 20.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;The fact is, doctors are not only managing pain better, but 
they are doing it with many new and effective options that 
don't include long term use of narcotics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. Richard M. Nolan"&gt;This program has become a model for our entire Nation, and 
I wanted to share it with the committee today for their 
awareness and examination.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Niki Tsongas&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;In closing, thank you for convening this hearing today--and 
helping us all move forward to put an end to this crisis that 
is affecting so many lives and families and communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the House 
Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, thank 
you for the opportunity to submit testimony today on the opioid 
epidemic, a health crisis indiscriminately affecting 
communities across this country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;In my home State of Massachusetts, there were an estimated 
2,107 opioid-related deaths in 2016, an increase of over two-
hundred percent in the last 10 years. To put that increase in 
perspective on a national level, according to news reports, in 
2016, more Americans died of drug overdoses than have ever died 
from car crashes, gun violence, or HIV/AIDS during any single 
year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;Thanks to the work of this committee, Congress has taken 
several steps to begin to address this crisis, but the stunning 
rise in opioid misuse, addiction and deaths calls on us to do 
more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;When people become addicted to painkillers, and then lose 
access to their prescription drug, many turn to illegally 
obtaining cheaper, more potent opioids such as heroin and 
synthetic drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;According to the most recent data from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, across the United States, over 
21,000 overdose deaths were caused by synthetic opioids between 
February 2016 and February 2017, twice as many as the previous 
12-month period. One of the leading contributors to this number 
is fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that can be up to 50 
times stronger than heroin and 100 times more powerful than 
morphine. Fentanyl has become the leading cause of overdose 
deaths nationwide, surpassing heroin in the summer of 2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;Although pharmaceutical fentanyl can be misused, most 
fentanyl deaths are linked to illicitly manufactured fentanyl 
and illicit versions of chemically similar compounds known as 
fentanyl analogs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;In Massachusetts, the proportion of overdose deaths 
attributed to fentanyl is rising at a meteoric rate. At its 
lowest, in the third quarter of 2014, fentanyl was present in 
18 percent of opioid-related deaths in Massachusetts. However, 
in 2016, fentanyl was present in a staggering 69 percent of the 
State's opioid-related deaths, resulting in 1,400 fentanyl-
related deaths in the Commonwealth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;The primary sources of fentanyl are outside the United 
States, principally Mexico and China. The drug is smuggled 
across the U.S. border or delivered through the mail or private 
carriers. Fentanyl can also be ordered online. And because of 
its extreme potency, fentanyl typically comes in small amounts, 
making it more difficult for authorities to detect.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;That is why earlier this year I introduced bipartisan 
legislation with Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) to 
provide Customs and Border Protection (CBP) with the latest in 
chemical screening devices and scientific support to detect and 
intercept fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;Not only would these devices allow law enforcement to 
detect and confiscate fentanyl before it enters the United 
States, but it would also protect law enforcement officers on 
the front lines from exposure to the deadly narcotic, which is 
so powerful that coming into contact with just a few grains can 
be fatal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;The House Committee on Homeland Security recently passed 
our bill, the International Narcotics Trafficking Emergency 
Response by Detecting Incoming Contraband with Technology, or 
INTERDICT, Act by voice vote and we are now urging House 
leadership to bring it to the floor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;The INTERDICT Act would be an important step towards 
stemming the rapid influx of illicit synthetic opioids, 
including fentanyl. However, to most effectively have an impact 
on this heart-wrenching epidemic, we must establish a 
comprehensive, fully funded plan at the local, State, and 
Federal level. Congress must continue to demonstrate its 
commitment to ending this epidemic by supporting the programs, 
agencies, organizations and individuals on the front lines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Niki Tsongas"&gt;We cannot afford to let our friends, family members and 
neighbors suffer under the burden and stigma of addiction and 
mental illness--especially given the scope and magnitude of the 
issue nationwide. My colleagues from all parts of the country, 
both Democrats and Republicans, have heard similar stories from 
their districts and we owe it to our communities to do all we 
can to head off this national epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
