    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. The Subcommittee on Communications and 
Technology will come to order just a little bit on the early 
side of 10:00 o'clock. The chair now recognizes herself for 5 
minutes for an opening statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN"&gt;I want welcome everyone to the first hearing of this year 
that is devoted exclusively to the promise of fifth generation 
wireless service, or 5G, and to explore the potential 
impediments to its deployment and wide-scale development.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN"&gt;In the interest of time, I will submit my full opening 
statement for the record. Suffice it to say, the race to 5G is 
on across the world as we compete with other countries and 
regions. As in any competition, one can either lead, follow, or 
get out of the way. As chairman of the subcommittee, I look 
forward to working on a bipartisan basis to ensure that America 
is first to the finish line.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Marsha Blackburn&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Marsha Blackburn"&gt;At this time I recognize the subcommittee ranking member, 
Mr. Doyle, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Marsha Blackburn"&gt;Welcome to the committee's first hearing this year devoted 
exclusively to the promise of fifth generation wireless 
service, or ``5G,'' and to explore the potential impediments to 
its development and wide-scale deployment. It is imperative 
Congress tackle these challenges. This hearing is entitled: 
``The Race to 5G and its potential to Revolutionize American 
Competitiveness.'' Let there be no mistake, the race to 5G is 
on across the world; and as in any competition, one can either 
lead, follow, or get out of the way. As Chairman of this 
Subcommittee, I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis 
to ensure America is first to the finish line.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Marsha Blackburn"&gt;The promise of 5G cuts across diverse industries and 
sectors of the economy. The potential benefits include: 
enhanced mobile broadband that can provide speeds that are 10 
to 100 times faster than what exists today; ultra-low latency 
communications that are necessary for mission-critical 
applications like autonomous vehicles and remote surgery; and 
the massive machine-to-machine communications that constitute 
the ``Internet of Things.'' According to Cisco, there will be 
nearly 50 billion IoT devices connected by the year 2020. Taken 
together, the applications of 5G promise to revolutionize 
manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, city management, 
power generation and distribution, as well as law enforcement 
and emergency response.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Marsha Blackburn"&gt;As we gaze towards the promise of 5G, we must also be 
mindful of the impediments to its deployment. Potential speed 
bumps along the way pertain to the harmonization of 
international technical standards, the availability of 
spectrum, and the strangling red tape of small cell siting 
requirements at the federal, state, and local levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Marsha Blackburn"&gt;Importantly, we must keep in mind that 5G is only part of 
the communications landscape that will ensure our 
competitiveness moving forward. 5G networks will exist 
alongside LTE networks, unlicensed spectrum necessary for Wi-
Fi, as well as traditional cable and landline networks, fiber 
optics, as well as satellite technologies. Each of these will 
continue to play prominent roles as our nation transitions to 
5G wireless connectivity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE"&gt;    Information is power, and history makes clear that 
countries with the best communications have the highest 
economic growth, and a distinct competitive advantage. 5G will 
play a major part in continuing our nation's leadership in 
communications. I am pleased to convene this hearing to explore 
the promise of 5G, and to examine the challenges to its 
development and deployment. I look forward to the testimony of 
our witnesses.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;And I just want to comment that today is a notice for 
Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. And I see some of our 
friends in the audience and colleagues wearing purple today. 
And I just want to recognize that and acknowledge what a 
terrible disease that is, and hope we find a cure someday.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Chairman, thank you for holding the hearing. And I want to 
thank all the witnesses here before us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;I believe that 5G holds a lot of promise and a lot of 
potential to drive American innovation, competitiveness, and 
productivity. But before I get into that, there are a few 
matters that I think need to be mentioned related to the FCC 
and their open meeting and reports of their plans to vote for 
repeal of the Open Internet Order as part of next month's open 
meeting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;In regard to this month's open meeting agenda, many 
members, myself included, have expressed grave concerns about 
the Chairman's agenda and the impact that it will have on media 
ownership, the Lifeline Program, and the ATSC 3.0 broadcast 
transition, or lack thereof, and the Commission's item on 
copper retirement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Each one of these items is terrible in its own right and 
will have grave impacts to the public. I would urge the 
Chairman to delay voting these items and seek bipartisan 
consensus and to chart a path forward that benefits all 
Americans, not just the biggest companies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;In regards to next month's open meeting and widely reported 
rumors that Chairman Pai plans to repeal the Open Internet 
Order, I would tell him to stop and consider the broader 
consequences.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;The success of the internet and the internet ecosystem has 
to be based on open access and a level playing field where 
consumers can access the services they want and edge providers 
can access customers without having to pay to get permission 
from gatekeepers or having to pay tolls.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Removing these rules removes this essential protection and 
threatens the virtuous cycle of investment and innovation that 
has made the internet what it is today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;So putting that aside, and to the matter at hand, 5G, next-
generation wireless networks have incredible potential to 
revolutionize our economy and our way of life. Think back to 
2007 and 700 megahertz auction. The iPhone has just been 
introduced, but the promise of smartphone technology and 
ubiquitous high-speed access was still just a dream.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;When Steve jobs announced the iPhone, it had to be 
connected to WiFi because 3G networks at the time weren't 
responsive enough. But today, nearly 80 percent of Americans 
own smartphones, and the global app economy has grown to be 
worth more than $1.6 trillion a year globally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;In the same way that LTE has put the internet in our 
pockets, 5G has the potential to connect every aspect of our 
lives. From smart transportation and self-driving vehicles, to 
connected medical devices and predictive diagnosis, to virtual 
and augmented reality, the promise of 5G has the potential to 
bring these technologies into reach.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;But to get to this promised land and to bring the future 
into the present, we need to chart a course that facilitates 
this technology by making new spectrum available and easing the 
deployment of new wireless infrastructure. My hope is that we 
can advance bipartisan legislation to free up additional 
spectrum to meet the needs of licensed and unlicensed 
industries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;On the other hand, I have seen draft legislation in the 
Senate, proposals at the State level, and heard rumblings from 
the FCC and their Broadband Deployment Advisory Council that 
all seek to preempt local government with a heavy hand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;To me, these approaches are all stick and no carrot. We 
need an approach that is collaborate, and we need to bring 
State and local governments into these discussions in a more 
productivity way.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;I am happy to see a representative from San Jose here 
today. Reading your testimony, I see that your city has big 
plans: self-driving vehicles, smart infrastructure, and using 
technology to meet the challenges you face. I am proud to say 
we have been doing all of this in Pittsburgh for quite a while 
now, and I am glad to see Silicon Valley finally catching up.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;My point is that great innovation is happening in cities 
all across the country, and local governments in cities like 
Pittsburgh, San Jose, and so many others have risen to meet 
these challenges. They don't need someone to run roughshod over 
them. They need partners that will help them meet the needs of 
their citizens.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;I believe that there is much this committee can do to 
facilitate the deployment of 5G and wireless broadband. My hope 
is that we can do in a that way that is thoughtful and 
inclusive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREG WALDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GREG WALDEN"&gt;    At this time, I recognize the chair of the full committee, 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And I have a very serious question for the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania. Do you know the way to San Jose?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;That was an old song, for those of you who are kind of new 
to this. The old radio guy in me coming out here. Do you want 
to sing it?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;OK. I want to welcome our witnesses. Thanks for being here 
today. We really value your testimony as we learn a lot about 
the fifth generation wireless technology, often called 5G. So 
thanks for being here, and thanks for your testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;This is going to revolutionize America's competitiveness. 
In the interest of saving time, I will submit the whole 
statement for the record. But the chairman of the subcommittee 
is correct, we are in a global race to develop and deploy 5G 
networks. Let there be no mistake: The race to 5G is a sprint, 
not a marathon. Even as we speak, competitors in Europe, Asia, 
and elsewhere are working to steal the mantle when it comes to 
having the best, most robust, and fastest communication 
networks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I do want to make one point regarding the promise of 5G to 
our competitiveness in manufacturing, healthcare, energy, smart 
cities, and autonomous transportation. None of the applications 
enabled by 5G technology will be possible without adequate 
spectrum, and all the rhetoric around the race to 5G will be 
for nothing if we do not update the Communications Act to allow 
the Federal Communications Commission to deposit upfront 
payments from prospective spectrum auction bidders directly 
with the Treasury.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Current law prevents the Commission from doing so. So I 
want to applaud the chairman of this subcommittee for including 
provisions in the FCC reauthorization bill to allow the 
Commission to do so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I also want to recognize the bipartisan work of 
Representatives Guthrie and Matsui in introducing standalone 
legislation to do the same thing. Thank you for that. I think 
we are all on the same page here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;But let me be clear. Absent a change in law, the FCC can't 
hold any auction of consequence to bring about the 5G 
revolution that we must encourage. So we all need to work 
together on a bipartisan basis to change that law so the 
Commission can again hold meaningful spectrum auctions. The 
inability to do so will mean the loss of billions in auction 
proceeds for deficit reduction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So, anyway, thank you for being here. Thanks for your 
testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Greg Walden&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;And, Madam Chair, with that, I will yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Thank you, Madame Chairman. I want to welcome our witnesses 
to this hearing on fifth generation wireless technology, often 
called ``5G,'' and its potential to revolutionize American 
competitiveness.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;The Chairman of the Subcommittee is correct--we are in a 
global race to develop and deploy 5G networks. Let there be no 
mistake: the race to 5G is a sprint, not a marathon. Even as we 
speak, competitors in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere are working 
to steal the mantle when it comes to having the best, most 
robust, and fastest communications networks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Mobile, cellular technology was developed in the United 
States first. We have seen it evolve from first generation 
networks that were only capable of voice service, to digital 
second-generation networks capable of voice and text, to third 
generation networks capable of voice, text, and basic Internet, 
to today's fourth generation LTE networks that unleashed true 
mobile broadband and video service. Approximately every 10 
years American consumers have seen a generational leap in 
wireless connectivity and applications. Just as we were the 
first to deploy mobile technology, so we must be first to 
deploy 5G throughout the ecosystem of networks, services, and 
applications that constitute our communications architecture.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;So, what is 5G? In short, 5G represents the next 
generational shift that will provide broadband speeds faster 
than existing wireless networks by at least an order of 
magnitude. It will do so by combining existing low- and mid-
band spectrum with higher, millimeter-band frequencies 
previously thought to be unusable for mobile broadband. It is 
only through combining low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum that 
we can realize the full promise of 5G in urban, suburban, and 
rural areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;It's been noted that 5G will enable enhanced mobile 
broadband, ultra-low-latency, and massive machine-to-machine 
communications. Examples of these benefits are in power 
generation and distribution through smart grid technology such 
as sensors on substations to report outages, as well as supply 
and demand readings on transmission lines that will allow 
dynamic pricing on smart home meters--potentially saving 
consumers hundreds of dollars annually on their power bills. We 
also anticipate increased efficiencies in the manufacturing 
sector through the application of 5G enabled sensors, 
controllers, and data analytics that allow for greater 
automation, predictive maintenance, and supply chain 
management.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;One of the most prominent examples of 5G applications is in 
autonomous vehicles. Earlier this year, our committee, and then 
the full House, unanimously voted for the first self-driving 
car legislation ever considered by Congress--the SELF DRIVE 
Act. This bill is critical to the development and deployment of 
self-driving car technology, which has the potential to save 
tens of thousands of lives each year. But the regulatory 
certainty provided by the SELF DRIVE Act will depend on the 
availability of spectrum. If America is to win the race to 5G, 
then we must figure out how to make more spectrum available for 
commercial service in addition to the regulatory reforms and 
international harmonization necessary to making this technology 
a reality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Lastly, and most importantly, I want to emphasize that all 
the rhetoric around the race to 5G will be for nothing if we do 
not update the Communications Act to allow the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) to deposit upfront payments 
from prospective spectrum auction bidders directly with the 
Treasury. Current law prevents the Commission from doing so. I 
want to applaud the Chairman of this Subcommittee for including 
provisions in the FCC Reauthorization bill to allow the 
Commission to do so. I also want to recognize the bipartisan 
work of Representatives Guthrie and Matsui in introducing 
stand-alone legislation to do the same thing. Let me be clear: 
absent a change in law, the FCC cannot hold any auction of 
consequence to bring about the 5G revolution. We must all work 
together on a bipartisan basis to change the law, so the 
Commission can again hold meaningful spectrum auctions. The 
inability to do so will mean the loss of billions in auction 
proceeds for deficit reduction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR., A REPRESENTATIVEIN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. FRANK PALLONE"&gt;    At this time, I recognize the ranking member of the full 
committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes for an opening.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;This Congress, Democrats on this committee have focused on 
protecting security, providing economic opportunities, and 
promoting democracy. Faster wireless networks have a potential 
to do all three.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;These technologies can make us safer by helping first 
responders react faster after an emergency or disaster. They 
can offer economic opportunity by helping people apply for jobs 
or train for a new career. And they can improve civic 
engagement by keeping people better connected with their 
government.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;People increasingly connect to the government using only 
their smartphones. That is especially true for the most 
vulnerable among us. Unfortunately, when they try to reach 
their government for help, too often they find Web sites that 
do not work on their mobile devices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And that is why I introduced the Connected Government Act 
earlier this year with Congresswoman Robin Kelly that was 
passed by the full House last night. Our bill ensures that all 
new Federal agency Web sites are designed to work well on 
mobile devices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And today I will look forward to discussing other ways that 
5G networks can serve all of our communities. While we have 
heard a lot this year about the importance of broadband in 
rural areas, today's hearing focuses on new technologies best 
designed for urban centers. These 5G technologies could present 
new opportunities for low-income Americans in urban areas who 
often struggle to pay for their connections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And I know that some say that speeding deployment of these 
networks means that we must sacrifice environmental 
protections, that we must undermine tribal sovereignty, and 
that we need to block our local governments. But I urge my 
colleagues to look passed these naysayers. Let's find a path 
that promotes broadband deployment while still respecting the 
public interest.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And I believe that the LIFT America Act, which was 
introduced by the Democrats on this committee earlier this 
year, does just that. Our bill ensures high-speed broadband 
deployment to 98 percent of the country without jeopardizing 
the environment, city governments, or tribal rights.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;It is unfortunate that while we are working here today to 
bring high-speed wireless broadband to urban areas, the FCC is 
working against us. As we speak, they are voting to kill the 
Lifeline Program as we know it, effectively taking wireless 
phones out of the hands of the people who need them the most. 
They are acting to senselessly cut the wireless lifeline to 7.3 
million Americans. And that is cruel, particularly when some of 
those Americans live in places that are still recovering from 
natural disasters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So I hope they reconsider and work with Congress to help 
those who need it most. Mr. Doyle talked about all the terrible 
things that we expect from the FCC over the next days or weeks, 
and I want to join in his comments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;But with that, I thank the witnesses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;And I would like to yield the rest of my time, half to 
Congresswoman Matsui, and other half to Congressman McNerney. 
So I yield now to Congresswoman Matsui.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;Thank you Madam Chairman. This Congress, Democrats on this 
Committee have focused on protecting security, providing 
economic opportunities, and promoting democracy. Faster 
wireless networks have the potential to do all three.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;These technologies can make us safer by helping first

interest.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;I believe that the LIFT America Act-which was introduced by 
the Democrats on this Committee earlier this year-does just 
that. Our bill ensures high-speed broadband deployment to 98

    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;It is unfortunate that while we are working here today to

Congress to help those who need it most.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Frank Pallone"&gt;    With that, I thank the witnesses, and I would like to yield 
one minute of time to Congresswoman Matsui and one minute of 
time to Congressman McNerney.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Thank you, Ranking Member Pallone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Additional spectrum will be critical for both 5G and 
advancements in technology and innovation. Carriers and 
broadband providers will need to find creative ways to free up 
bandwidth to meet consumer needs in a 5G-and-beyond world. This 
would be necessary to account for the Internet of Things 
economy, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and new 
innovations that we have yet to hear about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;A realistic 5G-and-beyond strategy will need to be creative 
and will not be a one-size-fits-all solution. I think that 
technologies like blockchain could play an interesting role for 
spectrum sharing and one that could potentially maximize the 
efficient use of spectrum bands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Thank you. And I yield to Mr. McNerney.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Well, I thank the ranking member, and I thank
my friend and colleague from Sacramento.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;I am basically going to repeat what the ranking member 
said. As we sit here today holding a hearing about increasing 
connectivity, the FCC is voting on an item that would do just 
the opposite; namely, a proposal to dismantle the Lifeline 
Program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;This will disconnect millions of low-income Americans. In 
my district alone, there are more than 56,000 households that 
participate in the Lifeline Program. The FCC Chairman's 
proposal will be absolutely devastating for those folks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;We all have constituents who rely on this program for 
essential communication services, all of us have constituents, 
such as getting in touch with family and friends and obtaining 
help during emergencies. We owe it to our constituents to help 
them stay connected.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;While I look forward to the hearing and I appreciate the 
witnesses coming today, I can't help but think about how today 
will be a serious step backward for connecting Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And I yield back, Madam Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Madam Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. Mr. Walden, you are recognized.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Well, with the indulgence of the committee,
today likely marks the last day of one of our veteran staff 
members, David Redl, who has worked for the committee for the 
last 7 years, was my chief counsel on the telecommunications 
subcommittee, and continued on in that role under our current 
chairwoman until the administration decided to pluck him from 
us, rather slowly. But that was the Senate, actually. The 
Senate was slow.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;But they have now confirmed him, and we have every reason 
to believe the President will sign the paperwork today and 
David Redl will go off into the administrative landscape of the 
NTIA where he will be on a completely faithful search for more 
spectrum to free up and make available.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So if we could honor our staffer, David Redl.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    [Applause.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And with that, Madam Chair, I yield back. And
we get back his section of the payroll, too. So thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. That is correct. And we wish Mr. Redl well. 
And we should send our friends in the Senate a case of Red Bull 
and encourage them to work more expeditiously as they approach 
the issues that he is going to handle for the administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;This concludes the member opening statements. The chair 
would like to remind members that, pursuant to the committee 
rules, all members' opening statements will be made a part of 
the record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;At this point, I would like to ask unanimous consent to 
enter into the record the opening statement of Mrs. Brooks and 
other members who may want to submit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Without objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Susan W. Brooks&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;[The information follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;I'm thrilled to be here today for this important hearing 
and would like to thank all of the witnesses for being here. 
I'm especially thrilled to have a Hoosier witness here, David 
Broecker, from the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute 
representing the great innovations occurring in our state.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;I have become increasingly engaged on efforts to empower 5G 
for a number of reasons. I'm proud that Indiana is one of 
thirteen states that have enacted state legislation to 
streamline the deployment of small cell networks, Indianapolis 
is an AT&amp;amp;T test site for 5G evolution build-out, and we have 
brilliant leaders like David working to innovate and build our 
communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;As the saying goes, innovation waits for no one, and for 
our economy to move at the speed of innovation, we must support 
new and emerging technologies. I recently co-founded the 5G 
Caucus with my colleague Congresswoman Debbie Dingell as a 
means to educate members and staff about how 5G will 
revolutionize our communities and the role we, as policymakers, 
need to play to empower 5G. Unfortunately, Congress isn't known 
for moving fast, and it is difficult for Congress to keep up 
with the speed of innovation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;Establishing a pipeline of new spectrum auctions to help 
meet America's mobile needs, promoting infrastructure reform to 
unlock tens of billions in 5G investment, and ensuring that 
wireless operators have rights to access municipal 
infrastructure in a timely manner are all key aspects as we 
work to unleash the power of 5G. Any regulations we consider 
should act like guardrails--not roadblocks or speed bumps--so 
that 5G pioneers can create the next generation of advancements 
within the guardrails--instead of having to navigate around a 
roadblock that would stifle or even prohibit technologies that 
improve the way we live our lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;5G means the opportunity for faster emergency response 
times that can save lives, smart cities, remote surgery, and 
unleashing the potential of the anticipated 50 billion new 
internet of things connected devices coming online by 2020.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Susan W. Brooks"&gt;I look forward to leading with Congresswoman Dingell on 
this issue and working together to advance sound policy that 
unlocks the economic potential of 5G and maintains and 
strengthens US leadership in next-generation technology.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Leonard Lance&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;Thank you Madam Chairman and welcome to our distinguished 
panel. Thank you for being with us here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;Wireless services have come a long way over the last 50 
years. The jump in capabilities from the first iteration of 
cellular technology, developed largely from the work done at 
Bell Labs in New Jersey, to the current 4th Generation LTE has 
been immense. However, these past innovations pale in 
comparison to the potential 5G has to revolutionize wireless 
communications. From improved data rates and speeds for 
consumers, to commercial applications in industries such as 
health care, agriculture, energy, education and manufacturing, 
5G's potential applications are almost limitless.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;As countries around the globe compete to lead in 5G, the 
district I serve is a hub of 5G development, thanks to the 
companies such as Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, Nokia, Qualcomm and Samsung. 
Because of companies like these, New Jersey is leading the 
effort to maintain the United States as the leader in wireless 
innovation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;American companies have already invested billions of 
dollars into 4G LTE and as they continue to invest in 4G, they 
have promised to invest hundreds of billions more in 5G. 
According to a recent report by Accenture, Americans will use 
five times more mobile data in 2021 than they do now. 5G has 
the potential not only to help networks manage this 
unprecedented data demand, but also to add over 3 million jobs 
in the next seven years and support 22 million jobs by the year 
2035.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;However, private investment alone will not win us the 
global race to 5G. Policymakers in Congress and the Federal 
Communications Commission must pursue policies to create 
regulatory regime that is conducive to the deployment of 5G 
infrastructure and ensure there is sufficient spectrum 
available for commercial use to meet future needs. We must help 
facilitate innovation by fueling the spectrum pipeline and 
removing regulatory barriers to deployment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;Wireless networks are complex and require a mix of 
different types of spectrum to meet coverage and capacity 
requirements. As our demand for wireless connectivity continues 
to skyrocket, the FCC and Congress must examine spectrum use in 
high, mid, and low bands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;Thank you again for being with us here today and I look 
forward to your testimony and discussion on this important 
topic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. We want to thank our witnesses for being 
here today and taking the time to testify for the subcommittee 
and for preparing your testimony in advance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;Today's witnesses are going to have the opportunity to give 
their opening statements, followed by a round of questions from 
the members. We are fully aware that we are on an abbreviated 
schedule for today as the President will arrive at 11:30 for 
the Republican Conference meeting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;We want to welcome our witnesses. Chris Pearson, president 
of 5G Americas. Dr. Coleman Bazelon, principal of the Brattle 
Group. The Honorable Jonathan Adelstein, who has been with us 
so many times, former FCC Commissioner and the current 
president and CEO of the Wireless Infrastructure Association. 
Shireen Santosham, the chief innovation officer for the city of 
San Jose, California--and she does know the way to San Jose. 
David Broeker, the founding CEO of the Indiana Biosciences 
Research Institute.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;We appreciate that each of you are here today and for 
preparing your testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance"&gt;We will begin the panel with you, Mr. Pearson. You are 
recognized for 5 minutes for an opening.
 STATEMENTS OF CHRIS PEARSON, PRESIDENT, 5G AMERICAS; COLEMAN&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF CHRIS PEARSON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="CHRIS PEARSON"&gt;    BAZELON, PRINCIPAL, BRATTLE GROUP; JONATHAN ADELSTEIN, 
PRESIDENT AND CEO, WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATION; SHIREEN 
  SANTOSHAM, CHIEF INNOVATION OFFICER, CITY OF SAN JOSE; AND 
   DAVID BROEKER, FOUNDING CEO, INDIANA BIOSCIENCES RESEARCH 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;Chairman Blackburn, Ranking Member Doyle, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for having me here 
today. I am Chris Pearson, president of 5G Americas, an 
association representing mobile operators and vendors from 
around our region. 5G Americas' board of governors includes 
AT&amp;amp;T, Cisco, CommScope, Ericsson, HPE, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, 
Samsung, Sprint, and T-mobile.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;5G Americas is also a Market Representative Partner of the 
standards forum 3GPP, where 5G is being standardized, and works 
with regulators around the world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;5G Americas represents our region in the Global 5G MOU 
Event twice a year in countries in Asia, Europe, and the 
Americas that are dedicated to winning the race to 5G. And next 
year, 5G Americas hosts our event here in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;5G, or fifth generation of wireless technology, is 
comprised of three use cases: enhanced or faster Mobile 
Broadband; Massive Machine Type Communications, also known as 
the Internet of Things; and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency 
Communications, often called critical communications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;So 5G is just not about faster broadband, although it would 
be nice to download that movie in seconds before you board that 
plane. It is about other things as well. Machine Type and 
critical communications will enable connected, autonomous 
vehicles and revolutionize our industries and lives with 
enhanced productivity, smarter cities and homes, safer roads, 
and more effective healthcare. Our industry is expected to 
invest $275 billion in 5G, resulting in $500 billion in GDP 
growth and millions of new jobs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;But this revolution requires more spectrum and efficient 
siting of wireless facilities. So we are grateful for this 
subcommittee's leadership on spectrum and its continued focus 
on ensuring that there is adequate spectrum for 5G.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;We support Mr. Guthrie and Ms. Matsui's spectrum auction 
receipts bill, which the FCC needs to hold any further auction, 
and urges the committee to act on that quickly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;Spectrum will be required for 5G in every range, low band, 
mid-band, and high band. Other countries around the world are 
making mid-band available for 5G, and the U.S. should, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;The countries that make new globally harmonized spectrum 
available for 5G are the ones that are going to lead this race. 
And thanks to this subcommittee, the U.S. led the way in 4G 
because it made new spectrum available for auction at 700 
megahertz and also in the mid-bands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;To create the global economies of scale that benefit U.S. 
consumers and businesses, we must have globally harmonized 
spectrum for 5G. In addition to allocating sufficient amounts 
of harmonized low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum, the U.S. must 
expedite siting procedures for the small cells that will be 
necessary for 5G. And for this reason, 5G Americas also 
supports the MOBILE NOW bill.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;Mobile data traffic is expected to grow seven to eight 
times in just a few short years, and meeting that demand will 
require operators to densify their networks, requiring 
streamlined procedures for all those new small cells. As we 
will hear from Mr. Adelstein, we must have model siting 
procedures that allow network densification.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;5G Americas supports the FCC's work in its BDAC advisory 
council bringing together stakeholders to recommend model codes 
for State and local government siting. And as necessary, should 
that effort not result in the streamlined siting required for

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF COLEMAN BAZELON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="COLEMAN BAZELON"&gt;    Dr. Bazelon, you are recognized.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to 
testify today on this important topic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;I started my career as an analyst at the Congressional 
Budget Office just as the second generation cellular services 
were beginning to be deployed. The developments of third and 
fourth generation technologies have helped fulfill the promise 
of wireless.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;The same will be true of, 5G which will bring unprecedented 
speeds and low latency to wireless networks, supporting new 
applications and development of an Internet of Things. And as 
with those earlier developments, additional spectrum is needed 
to fulfill the 5G promise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;Unlike the previous technological advancements, 5G combines 
new technologies with a new architectural model of how spectrum 
is deployed. The architecture of a robust 5G network will 
require spectrum in a variety of bands: low-band spectrum below 
1 gigahertz for wide-area and long-range communications; mid-
band spectrum between 1 and 6 gigahertz for applications that 
would benefit a combination of coverage and capacity; and high-
band spectrum for short-range communications requiring fast 
data rates and low latency. All three pieces of this spectrum 
trifecta will be crucial for the successful deployment of 5G 
networks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;The Principle of Spectrum Reallocation states that when the 
value of a band of spectrum in a new use exceeds the value in 
an existing use, plus the cost of transitioning the 
frequencies, it should be reallocated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;This simple principle, that benefits should exceed costs, 
can face many obstacles in practice. Incumbent users, whether 
TV broadcasters or government agencies, tend to be reluctant to 
relinquish spectrum assignments. Consequently, mechanisms where 
incumbents are compensated are beneficial because they overcome 
resistance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;In fact, anything that can be done to smooth the transfer 
of spectrum is helpful. For example, the recently introduced 
Spectrum Auction Deposits Act, which overcomes impediments 
identified by Chairman Pai to holding spectrum auctions, will 
facilitate future auctions, and the Spectrum Reallocation Fund 
will help provide frequencies for those auctions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;The new 5G deployments will have profound implications for 
spectrum value. On the one hand, being able to integrate 
massive amounts of high-band spectrum into commercial mobile 
networks will flood the market with spectrum capacity, at least 
in dense or more populous areas and for applications that can 
utilize the higher frequency spectrum. On the other hand, these 
new networks will enable new wireless services and increase 
consumer expectations about throughput and reliability.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;The net impact of these two offsetting effects is 
uncertain, and overall spectrum values could go up or down. But 
within the overall net impact on spectrum values, there is a 
clear implication for different types of spectrum from 
increased user expectations for throughput, mobility, latency 
that will be fostered by the new 5G deployments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;The value of mid-band spectrum used for capacity outside 
the areas served by high-band 5G deployments should increase 
because demand for network capacity, reset to a user experience 
based on a higher level of throughput in the urban areas, will 
be greater in those non-urban areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;The Principle of Spectrum Reallocation is applicable to all 
bands that make up the 5G spectrum trifecta, but I will focus 
on mid-band spectrum, the connective tissue of 5G deployments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;In my accompanying paper submitted to the committee that 
CTIA released yesterday, I examined the value of making an 
additional 100 megahertz of mid-band spectrum available in the 
1,300 to 1,350 megahertz and 1,780 to 1,830 megahertz bands. 
After accounting for a moderation in spectrum value compared to 
recent highs, I find that a 50 plus 50 megahertz paired band 
would be expected to raise $63 billion in auction receipts. 
Making those frequencies available is expected to cost up to an 
estimated $8 billion in relocating existing users, providing 
them with at least equivalent and in many cases improved 
wireless infrastructure. Consequently, this band could be 
expected to raise $55 billion in net receipts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;Admittedly, there is some uncertainty about forecasting 
future auction receipts. Frankly, it is not for the faint of 
heart. But as long as the auction of this 100 megahertz of mid-
band spectrum raises more than $8 billion, a paltry amount for 
so much spectrum that could be used for mobile broadband, 
reallocating the Federal users and auctioning the reclaimed 
spectrum will create value.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;The application of the Principle of Spectrum Reallocation 
does not end here. For example, all or part of the 3.7 to 4.2 
gigahertz band could be valuably deployed in support of 5G 
networks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;I have investigated this band and found that, even with 
conservative assumptions about the value of both the existing C 
band services and potential new deployments, reallocating some 
or all of this band would likely create value. A voluntary 
mechanism that ensures incumbents benefit from any transition 
will help facilitate making additional needed frequencies 
available for new 5G networks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF JONATHAN ADELSTEIN&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="JONATHAN ADELSTEIN"&gt;    Mr. Adelstein, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chairman and Ranking Member
Doyle, members of the subcommittee, for the opportunity to 
testify. This hearing today is historic for a number of 
reasons, not just the topic, but because it is David Redl's 
last time on that side of the dais and not over here where he 
will soon be.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;We congratulate Mr. Redl on his rapid confirmation by the 
Senate. And you wonder why I say ``rapid.'' By my standards, 
what I went through, it is actually pretty quick. So it is all 
relative.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;I represent the Wireless Infrastructure Association that 
represents companies that build, own, manage, and maintain 
wireless facilities across the country. And we applaud the 
leadership of this subcommittee on promoting wireless broadband 
deployment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;The wireless industry stands ready to make enormous 
investments, up to $275 billion to build out 5G. It will lead 
to 3 million new jobs and $500 billion to boost GDP.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;And the U.S. is really well-positioned to lead 5G, 
especially with David Redl as head of the NTIA. It will be 
something that will face stiff competition, though. We have 
competition from around the globe. Fortunately, this 
subcommittee, the FCC, and the administration have all shown a 
clear commitment to policies that encourage 5G investment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;5G could prove one of the most transformational 
technologies in the history of technology. But as promising as 
the standard for 5G is, it is only as good as the 
infrastructure on which it is deployed. 5G will involve up to a 
hundred times more antenna locations than 3G or 4G, so all 
types of infrastructure are needed. And fully realizing the 
potential of 5G depends on how effectively it gets deployed. 
Responsible infrastructure deployment is key.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Our industry works very closely with local governments, 
like San Jose. But if a company carelessly circumvents 
localities, it rightly angers the community and creates 
resistance to siting new facilities, and that can slow 5G.The 
WIA and its members seek to work in partnership with 
localities, because that is the best way to develop networks 
over the long-term.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;This subcommittee has long promoted responsible deployment. 
In fact, the great example of that is Section 6409(a) of the 
Spectrum Act. The law clearly sped 4G deployment by allowing 
upgrades on cell towers without burdensome zoning reviews, and 
it will continue to provide relief for the deployment of 5G 
through colocation, which is preferred by localities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Many communities welcome wireless deployments with 
streamlined siting policies. In fact, 13 States have passed 
laws to streamline deployment. I think Congress can bring all 
communities up to that same high standard by speeding the 
approval of permits and applications. Congress should provide a 
deemed granted remedy if a locality fails within a prescribed 
shot clock to approve an application.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;The FCC system for working with tribes who indicate a 
possible historic cultural interest often far outside of tribal 
lands is not working properly. It should be updated to exclude 
deployments with no new ground disturbance and ensure that fees 
are reasonable and appropriate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Congress should also modernize the historic preservation 
laws by excluding certain small cell deployments from 
unnecessary reviews. And Congress should revamp the Byzantine 
process of siting on Federal lands to speed deployment on rural 
areas, something we have concentrated on, on the BDAC, in the 
subcommittee I chaired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Another barrier to 5G is the growing gap between the skills 
of today's workers and the skills needed to build tomorrow's 
wireless networks. Many of our members report they are having 
difficulty in filling positions with qualified applicants.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Now WIA is working to build bridges that will jump across 
that gap so that we can bring apprenticeships for the first 
time into the wireless industry. WIA is also developing 
training programs to support that, because we can't afford the 
lack of trained workers to slow the path to 5G.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;We are encouraged that Congress and the administration are 
seeking new ways to partner with industry on job training and 
on apprenticeship programs, because thousands of new high-wage 
jobs await those with the proper skills.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF SHIREEN SANTOSHAM&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="SHIREEN SANTOSHAM"&gt;    Ms. Santosham, you are recognized, 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;Good morning, Chairman Blackburn, Ranking
Member Doyle, and members of the subcommittee. I am Shireen 
Santosham. I am chief innovation officer for Mayor Sam Liccardo 
in San Jose, California, the largest city in Silicon Valley. 
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss how cities are 
creating favorable environments to speed deployment of 
broadband.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;I want to particularly thank Congresswoman Eshoo for her 
focus on this issue and her excellent service for all 
Californians. We are truly fortunate to have her represent us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;Cities large and small are eager for increased broadband 
investment and competitive choices for our residents. We 
understand the benefits of broadband to economic growth and 
creating an on-ramp to opportunity for our young people to 
learn and participate in the jobs of tomorrow.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;In San Jose we welcome technological advancement with open 
arms. This year alone we have launched an autonomous vehicle 
initiative, a crowdsourced civic challenge utilizing drones, 
entered into public-private partnerships with companies like 
Facebook. Just this past Monday our city council unanimously 
passed our broadband and digital inclusion strategy that 
includes several recommendations to streamline deployment and 
pave the way for technologies like 5G.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;San Jose is excited and ready to welcome 5G to our 
community. But at the same time, we have 95,000 residents in 
our city without broadband access. Think about that. In the 
heart of Silicon Valley, nearly 10 percent of our residents 
don't have adequate access to the internet.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;It breaks my heart every time I hear about children in our 
community who are trying to do their homework on a mobile 
device outside their school because they don't have internet 
access at home. They are losing the race before it starts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;So while I welcome this next generation of the internet, we 
can't leave people further behind in the process. How this 
technology is deployed and who benefits matters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;Unfortunately, much of the State-level legislation that 
recently passed in over a dozen States to streamline deployment 
goes too far and gives telecommunications industries the 
benefit of a public utility without the obligation to serve 
everyone at affordable rates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;I am going to tell you about one of these bills, SB 649, 
which was wisely vetoed by our Governor in California and 
highlights issues relevant to Federal action that we believe 
are important for you to consider.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;The first is the extremely low caps that allowed cities to 
charge--that were allowed for placing small cells in the public 
right-of-way at cost. In fact, upon an independent review, 
these rates were found to be below cost, resulting in the State 
obliged to reimburse cities for the difference had it been 
signed into law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;Not only would the bill cost cities, but it also stripped 
away the ability of local governments to incentive build-outs 
in traditionally underserved areas. In San Jose, we have 
digital deserts in the middle of our city where low-income 
Latino families live. By using market-based pricing of assets 
and negotiating citywide deployments, we can incentive the 
telecom industry to build out in these underserved areas. 
Preemption of local authorities to charge market rates and 
giving by-right access to industry removes these incentives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;Second, equipment size and scale matters. Although the 
industry describes small cells as the size of a pizza box, the 
dimensions listed under SB 659 for small cells were over 21 
cubic feet, the size of a standard refrigerator. Such massive 
pieces of equipment need adequate safety review, and 
communities will want input if thousands are deployed on their 
sidewalks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;Finally, the public benefits from local governments acting 
as a referee for the competing needs of the finite space in the 
public rights of way.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;So how can we move forward? We need a balanced approach to 
ensure that we are speeding deployment while benefiting the 
public broadly. Cities can create one-stop shops for providers, 
co-create design standards with industry, negotiate citywide or 
batch process permits, and offer transparent and fair pricing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;On the Federal level, we must avoid preemption of cities if 
we want to see equitable and safe deployment. The Federal 
Government should instead focus on developing the capacity of 
local leaders to manage deployments in community-centric ways. 
The Federal Government should also be careful not to pick 
winners and losers through policy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;On behalf of Mayor Liccardo and the city of San Jose, I 
want to thank the subcommittee for inviting me to participate 
in this hearing today. I look forward to questions, and we are 
willing and able to help in any of your districts that are also 
struggling with some of these questions of deployment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF DAVID BROEKER&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DAVID BROEKER"&gt;    Mr. Broeker, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Broeker&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Good morning. Thank you, Committee Chair
Blackburn, Ranking Member Doyle, and Congresswoman Brooks and 
other honorable members of this committee, for inviting me here 
today to talk about the impact of 5G on the future of life 
sciences and advanced manufacturing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;My name is David Broeker, and I am the founder and 
principal of a legacy bioscience consulting company. I help 
entrepreneurs and innovators in the life sciences area advance 
their ideas to the marketplace. And I am also the founding 
president and CEO of the Indiana Biosciences Research 
Institute.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Indiana is home to one of the most diverse, robust life 
science sectors in the country, with companies in 
biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, agriculture, 
animal health, and diagnostics. Eleven percent of our workforce 
are employed by these companies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;The State has consistently been second to our colleagues 
from California as the largest exporter of life science 
products in the United States, exporting more than $9.9 billion 
in products and contributing over $62 billion to the Indiana 
economy in 2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Across life sciences today, biology and applied data 
science are converging to help researchers and scientists 
understand the genome and the massive amounts of data that are 
being generated every day. This convergence will require now 
capabilities and infrastructure like 5G to allow researchers to 
share these large data streams in ways that are better, faster, 
cheaper.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;The ability to do this will enhance discovery for new 
medicines and treatments for patients and enable the Massive 
Internet of Medical Things that are upon us to create new 
innovation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;The development of the Massive Internet of Medical Things 
will connect patients to their physicians through telemedicine, 
augmented and virtual reality, interventions. It will make 
digital technologies like smart devices, wearables and sensors 
a part of the delivery of care to improve patients' lives. And 
when combined with other enabling technologies like blockchain, 
data standards, and encryption, it will create a shift away 
from place-dependent electronic medical records to virtual 
individual health records that will improve the quality of care 
through personalized medicine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;5G technology will enable life science manufacturers to 
create better and more secure supply chains that will connect 
patients and distribution partners as well as create 
opportunities to improve the quality and productivity of the 
research and development process and the ultimate tech transfer 
and manufacturing of these products.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;For example, 5G technology will enable the real-time 
capture of appropriate patient information to improve safety 
monitoring and adverse event reporting. It will also allow for 
100 percent tracking of product distribution to the patient.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;It will improve the efficiency of clinical studies by 
providing 100 percent verifiable external data capture and 
exchange with researchers and development partners like 
contract research organizations. It will improve the technology 
transfer within companies between development teams and 
manufacturing operations to shorten timelines and bring 
innovations to the market faster.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;5G will also create opportunities to connect the patient 
literally to the shop floor and integrate advanced 
manufacturing capabilities like 3-D printing to make customized 
devices, cell-based therapies and therapeutics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Finally, 5G will result in more automation of 
manufacturing, improving the speed and efficiency, creating 
more manufacturing jobs, and enhancing the technology focus 
within the current manufacturing operations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Just like the Nation's interstate highway system made the 
fast and easy exchange of goods across the country possible, 5G 
technology will drive innovation in the life sciences by 
providing a better avenue for exchange of massive amounts of 
data being generated across the information-rich landscape of 
healthcare and life science innovation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;I would just like to leave you with one factoid that I 
researched in coming to the committee today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;I don't know how many people know what a zettabyte is. But 
a zettabyte is 1 followed by 21 zeros. So it is a pretty big 
number. And if you look at the major internet service providers 
today, they traffic a little over 1 zettabyte of information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;In the next 3 years, it is projected that that will 
increase by over fiftyfold. So think about that amount of data 
and the infrastructure that is required to exchange, connect, 
and the convergence that is possible in life science and 
manufacturing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;5G is critical enabling technology for America and will 
help drive new innovations in healthcare and increase 
competitiveness in advanced manufacturing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Broeker follows:][GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Broeker "&gt;Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Broeker "&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back. This concludes 
our opening statements, and we are ready to move to questions 
and answers. And I will recognize myself for 5 minutes to begin 
that portion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Broeker "&gt;Mr. Broeker, I want to start with you. I am so pleased that 
you mentioned the manufacturing component. We have 341,000 
Tennesseans who are in manufacturing. Last year, $30 billion 
worth of exports. So we are not quite to where you are with 
your Indiana number.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Broeker "&gt;    But I want you to talk about this from two sides. You look 
at one of our States and you say: This is the potential if the 
investment is made, and this is what could happen if the 
investment is not made into 5G. Because I think this is 
something that we all are discussing. Mr. Johnson is working on 
broadband expansion. Mrs. Brooks is chairing the effort on 5G. 
So if you will take it from those two sides.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Broeker&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Chairman Blackburn, a very good question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;I have been in and around life sciences my whole career, 
over 30, 35 years, and I actually started off as a 
manufacturing engineer. So I was one of those engineers running 
around the shop floor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Manufacturing is both a capital-intensive and a people-
intensive business. And currently, if you look at 
manufacturing, most companies can site that manufacturing 
anywhere in the world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;And so what really drives companies to make decisions 
related to that manufacturing are a favorable business 
environment, which includes things like tax policy; 
availability and access to a trained workforce and talent; and 
the infrastructure that is required to make all of those things 
work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;And so my point would be that if we don't do this, 
manufacturing will go elsewhere. It will start to--continue to 
go outside the United States, because it is a global 
opportunity for companies to go other places to set up new 
manufacturing and manufacturing of the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;So I think 5G enables us to become even more competitive 
than we have. And when you look at the future of the innovation 
that is possible, then we can capture that making it here in 
the great States that all of you represent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Just yesterday, I saw that for the very first time the FDA 
has approved a digital pill. This is a pill that is a 
combination of a drug. You swallow it. When it hits your 
stomach, there is a sensor in the pill that releases 
information to your smartphone that can go to the patient, it 
can go to their family, it can go to your healthcare provider.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;These are the kinds of things that are possible even today. 
FDA, as I said, just approved this digital pill yesterday. And 
so I think, without a technology like 5G and the infrastructure 
that this represents from a manufacturing standpoint, we have 
the potential to fall behind other countries that implement it 
better and faster than we do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;    And, yes, we had watched the development of this in the 
Software Act this committee passed out as a part of 21st 
Century Cures as a part of enabling that type technology to 
move forward with, I think it is, Otsaku is the company.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Broeker&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;It is Otsuka.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Broeker&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;It is a new medicine for schizophrenia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. Which is a great opportunity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;Mr. Adelstein, I have got 19 counties, 10,000 square miles 
in my congressional district. And I was out last weekend 
talking with one of our county mayors and he was all about 5G, 
so excited about the potential that is there for 5G.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Broeker"&gt;    If you were talking to one of my mayors, and economic 
development, bringing jobs back is something they talk about, 
they also talk about healthcare and educational opportunity, if 
you were to kind of crunch it down, talk about that 
opportunity. How is this going to change what is happening in 
rural communities with the advent of 5G, what is going to be 
most significant and most notable?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;I think probably, as you indicated, what is
most significant is the economic development opportunity for 
rural areas. Suddenly rural areas have at their fingertips the 
vast amounts of data they can both communicate and receive, as 
anybody anywhere in the world, if they can have that level of 
technology available, if it gets deployed to rural America, 
which we hope it can as quickly as possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;So there is opportunity for jobs to be located there, for 
people that are visiting to stay longer because they can get 
their work done there, for new businesses to locate there, 
where it is a better quality of life and lower cost of living 
and lower cost of doing business.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;So it is really an opportunity to revolutionize the way 
that business is done in rural America. I think it is something 
that a lot of folks that I spoke with when I worked at the 
Rural Utilities Service, as the head of it, were so concerned 
about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you for that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;    And I am going to at this point yield 5 minutes to the 
ranking member.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;    Ms. Santosham, you are a member of the FCC's Broadband 
Deployment Advisory Council, right? And San Jose is the only 
local government on this 30-member council. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; Actually, we were the only municipal
representative when it was first appointed, but now they have 
added two more.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt; Great.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; One from Kansas and one from Georgia.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt; Tell me, what is the impact of local government
representation? How do you think it is impacting the 
recommendations of the Advisory Committee?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;It has been a challenge in terms of both the
process and the output of how we are working. And it is an 
issue that the National League of Cities, National Association 
of Counties, and U.S. Conference of Mayors, along with 237 
bipartisan mayors across the country have written to Chairman 
Pai about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;    And the numbers speak for themselves in terms of the 
approach to how we will deploy broadband. And we really do need 
more local government representation. And we are at the table, 
we are talking to the FCC. But we hope that we can get more 
representation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Commissioner Adelstein. Jonathan, welcome back. Good to see 
you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;    You are on the commission too, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt; How do you think local government input is being
handled?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Well, there are also members of local
government on the working groups that aren't on the full BDAC. 
There is also a State commissioner from the State of 
Massachusetts sits on the group. So there are a number of 
representatives of municipal and local governments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;I think the chairman is really seeing this as an 
opportunity for industry to work with localities to try to come 
up with consensus solutions. For example, a State code that 
would be a model, a municipal code that is a model. There has 
been a lot of good dialogue going back and forth between 
localities and the industry on that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;    And we have the opportunity to take input from outside of 
the working group as well. I mean, we are listening very 
closely to localities. We feel that if we can't get a good 
State or local code that is a consensus document that really is 
working together, it is not going to get adopted anyway.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Mr. Bazelon, let me ask you. In your testimony, you 
mentioned the challenges of freeing up the spectrum resources 
for deploying 5G networks. And when we look at the lower part 
of the C band, the 3.7 to 4.2 gigahertz band, do you think it 
is realistic that satellite users will totally vacate the whole 
band, as some in the wireless industry have suggested, or do 
you think it is more realistic that the FCC might be able to 
repack some part of the band to free up spectrum that could be 
used for mobile license usage.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;    I mean, I know in your heart of hearts you would like to 
have the whole thing. But I am just curious where you think 
reality lies given the complexities in the incumbent licenses.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;So first the economist answer is that the value created by 
the band should be more than enough to compensate the existing 
users. And so from a social perspective, the band probably 
should be freed up. But there are stakeholders there, and they 
have legitimate and real concerns. And a process where they are 
working with the reallocation process is one that is more 
likely to be successful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;    So a voluntary mechanism that allows them to share in the 
gains of their efforts to free up the spectrum is one that I 
think is more likely to be successful. Whether that ends up 
clearing the entire band or part of the band I think is for the 
people who know best in the band to figure out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;    Mr. Pearson, in your testimony you talk about international 
harmonization of 5G bands. What part of the C band that I have 
just asked Mr. Bazelon about is being considered for global 
harmonization?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt; I would have to go back and look at that and
study it a little bit further. But what we are looking at in 
most countries around the world is they are looking at focusing 
on low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum, all three. And so the C 
band would be one of those things they are looking at. I would 
have to look at exactly where I would go to focus on that, a 
little bit more research.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;    Finally, Ms. Santosham, following up on my initial question 
to you. It seems like San Jose has been identified by some in 
the wireless industry as a problem child, that you are impeding 
the deployment of broadband technologies. Why do you think you 
are being labeled that way? I mean, from what I can tell, you 
and your city seem to be working very hard to advance the 
deployment of broadband technologies. Where is the disconnect 
there?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;Well, it was a surprise to us, to be honest.
We are one of the leading cities on these issues, on technology 
issues broadly, as I talked about. And we recently hired Smart 
Cities' lead for our city, who has 25 years of telecomms 
experience, hadn't worked in government before, is coming in 
and completely retooling how our city is approaching broadband 
deployment in order to speed permitting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;So we were surprised that we were getting accused of 
charging fees and rates that were actually well in excess of 
what we actually do charge. And it was disappointing that we 
couldn't have a more collegial conversation about how do we 
actually deploy broadband.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;    Because cities around this country, we want it. We want 
investment. When I go to neighborhood associations with the 
folks in my community, they want neighborhood fiber, because 
they are not happy about the investment that has been made.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Doyle&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Doyle"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. Mr. Walden, you are recognized.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Mr. Bazelon, in the report you released this week, I 
understand you estimated two bands of spectrum could raise us 
$54 billion in net revenue to the Federal Government after 
relocation cost to incumbents. Even here in Washington we think 
that is a lot of money.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    I know the focus of your paper was on mid-band spectrum, 
but are there potential low- and high-band spectrum bands we 
could combine with these in spectrum auction legislation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;Certainly, as has been said, all three types
of spectrum are needed. And to the extent that auctions would 
facilitate reallocations, that would be a good idea. But as 
with all bands, there are incumbent users, and it sort of 
depends on the specifics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;I would suggest that, at the low band, the television 
frequencies are still ripe for the economic tests I suggested 
about the value in new use versus current use, but also 
appreciate that is unlikely to be an area of focus any time 
soon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;    And the FCC, I don't know what time it is, but they may 
have just reallocated more spectrum from the high band. And 
should any of those be auctioned, that would be about a useful 
addition.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    And, Mr. Pearson, do you have any thoughts on this matter?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;Yes. I think that, as you said, there is a lot
of money at stake here, because if you put in auction processes 
and rules that make that spectrum, whether it is low, mid, or 
high, it is very valuable spectrum for the mobile wireless 
industry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;I know there has been a lot about 5G just being a 
millimeter-wave story. And if you look at internationally 
specifically, if you go to China, if you look at Japan, if you 
look at Korea and Europe, they are looking at this in all the 
bands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;    And so specifically, the mid-bands and the millimeter 
coupled together become part of the story of 5G. It is a bigger 
story than just millimeter-wave.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And, Mr. Bazelon, there is a perennial debate around here 
about authorizing specific bands for auction versus providing 
the FCC with blanket auction authority. The most recent 
estimate from the CBO, Congressional Budget Office, said that 
if we just gave blanket authority, it would raise a very small 
amount of money compared to what you have put forward. A 
blanket extension, I think, would be around a billion dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    A billion dollars is still a lot of money. But when you put 
it up against the potential for $54 billion net to the Treasury 
just for those two bands, do you have a view on whether we 
should give blanket authority or reserve it for auction?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;There is no reason that the FCC shouldn't have
blanket authority, and the two are not actually in conflict.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;The reason, my understanding, and now I have put on my 
green eyeshades from my CBO days as a budget scorer, the reason 
blanket authority today has such a low score is because, in 
essence, the low-hanging fruit of what can be reallocated and 
auctioned has already happened.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;    So that is why it is important that the incumbents are 
incentivized to cooperate, whether that is through government 
diktat or through a market mechanism, and typically that takes 
additional legislation. But those additional efforts by 
Congress would create a positive score even if----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; Are you sure? We did that in 2012, and AWS-3
auction came back at zero from CBO, and it sold for $44.4 
billion. So I don't have a lot of faith in taking away our 
tools, relying on others.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt; I don't think that whether there was blanket
authority or not would have changed that score. So it is an 
issue. And as I said, it is a very difficult thing, forecasting 
receipts, and also the clearing costs. But I don't think the 
blanket authority is what is actually creating the problem 
there.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Mr. Pearson, do you have any comment on this? Do you care 
about this issue?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt; I don't have any comment to add any further,
no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;All right. Well, I just think we worry up here
about losing the incentive to do a lot of this work if we don't 
get a score out of it. I think that is a driving force really.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;We want to continue to make spectrum available, don't get 
my wrong. But you have to put a lot of work into a lot of 
issues, and I am afraid if we give blanket authority, CBO is 
going to say: Well, there went your money in the future, and 
that 54 billion you have identified may be there, but you don't 
get to count it. And we have things we are going trying to get 
done.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    So I think it does present--Mr. Adelstein, do you want to--
--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; One thought for CBO is that the Guthrie-
Matsui bill would allow an auction otherwise the chairman is 
saying can't take place. So it seems to me, if CBO is being 
accurate, they should give a very good score to that, because 
that auction for high frequency bands could yield a very large 
sum for the Federal Treasury.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And just one, maybe, for the record, because I
know my time has expired. But is anybody looking at--I heard a 
discussion the other night about, literally, AM radio side 
bands and new technology to do compression on the down wave 
side that doesn't get counted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Is anybody looking at that? Are you aware of any of that? 
All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;It was an interesting new theory. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;No, no, no. I was hoping to get more information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And thanks again to our witnesses for being here.RPTR 
TELLEDTR CRYSTAL[10:58 a.m.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. The chairmanis reminding us that he has 
that broadcast knowledge and information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    OK, Mr. Welch, 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Mr. Adelstein, I think I will start asking questions to 
you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;When you describe what the potential benefit is in rural 
America, that is really the heart of my concern, because we 
have to have the build-out in rural America. We don't have it. 
Mr. Latta and I have started a bipartisan caucus, the Rural 
Caucus.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;And the real issue here is, frankly, my skepticism that the 
investments that will be required for 5G will be made in rural 
areas. And specifically, as I understand it, you need more 
towers with 5G. They don't have the penetration powers, the 
signal penetration is shorter, and it is much more vulnerable 
to obstacles.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    So the worry I have is that the same cost-prohibitive 
obstacles to build out in rural areas under existing technology 
will persist with 5G technology. So can you address that major 
concern and how those of us who do represent rural areas can be 
just absolutely certain we are not going to get the short end 
again?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; Well, I think you identified a very
legitimate issue. I mean, basically the biggest problem with 
rural deployment is economics. The industry builds to where 
there is demand, and they build where there is a return, 
especially when it is very costly to build these networks and 
there----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; No, no, we all understand that. It doesn't pay
economically. So what do we need for build-out rules if, in 
fact, the rural America is going to get the benefits that you 
described are right there if we have the system in place?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; Well, every dollar spent on needless
regulation is a dollar that can't be spent on rural America. 
There is limited capital budgets. And so if we are getting 
caught up----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Wait. No, no. Wait. I get it on regulation. But
you said something that is obviously true. If the market isn't 
there, it is sort of like electricity, there is no incentive, 
regulation or not, for an investor to go to rural Vermont as 
opposed to urban Burlington, let's say, right? That is just 
economics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    So there has got to be some public policy. And let's assume 
we have a favorable regulatory system, as you see it, because I 
don't want extra regulations. How do we guarantee that there 
will be build-out in rural America when there is no money in it 
for the big players?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; The primary mechanisms for policy are the
Universal Service and the Rural Utilities Service that work in 
concert. As a matter of fact, when I was administrator of the 
Rural Utilities Service we provided a grant to VTel in Vermont 
that was----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; So what would we need? I mean, look, all of us
here represent rural America, OK, and this is a problem. So 
let's just say we agree on regulations because we don't want to 
make it more expensive, but there has got to be some money that 
goes into it without the rural America having to beg for 
everything. I mean, are we entitled to the same level of 
services in urban areas or not? That is the question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; Well, the Communications Act says comparable
service and comparable rates, and that is the purpose of 
Universal Service. So it is in this committee's jurisdiction to 
try to ensure that Universal Service builds it out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Right. But, actually, I loved your testimony,
but you are not reassuring me, because I am asking the ``how'' 
question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    All right. Dr. Bazelon, how about you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;So there are lots of benefits to living in
rural areas. One of the costs is that some things cost more 
there. When there is a public policy to make sure that is 
provided to rural areas the government is going to have to step 
in and assure it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;    Mechanisms in the past where there have been internal 
cross-subsidizations from urban to rural areas have been shown 
to be rather costly, and we have moved away from that model to 
more directly, if you want to create demand in a rural area, 
you subsidize the cost to providing the service. Once that is 
in place, though, and there is demand from people in rural----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;How do we get it in place? I mean, the build-out
expenses, as I understand it, in rural areas is going to be 
high, and there is not going to be the incentive for the 
investors to do that because they don't get their return.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    So how do we avoid making the same mistake? A lot of 
rhetoric about the benefits of this build-out in rural America 
but no follow-through.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt; It is a Universal Service-type program where
the difference in the cost of serving those customers and what 
is considered a reasonable price needs to be made up from other 
users or from the public. So that will create the demand. With 
the demand the carriers will come and build to them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt; Mr. Pearson.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt; Well, the only thing I would like to add to
the discussion is when you say it is going to cost more to 
build out a 5G in these areas, really when you look at building 
out 5G, if you lose the low bands or the mid-bands, it is not 
necessarily more costly to go. We already have one carrier that 
got spectrum from the 600 auction, and they have said that they 
are going to build out 5G in that band, and it carries waves 
that will cover----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Welch&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;All right. My time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;I just want to say one thing, Madam Chair. I think we need, 
those of us who represent rural America, some concrete build-
out rules that can give us concrete confidence that somehow, 
some way, the system is going to serve rural America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. So noted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Welch"&gt;    At this time, Mr. Lance, you are recognized, 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you, Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Dr. Bazelon, Congress, and specifically this committee, 
recognized the need to address more commercial spectrum that 
resulted in the 2012 Spectrum Act, and it spurred three 
auctions. Now that these auctions have run their course, is it 
your view that we need a new spectrum pipeline initiative to 
meet America's future spectrum needs?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt; As I think has been pointed out numerous
times, it takes a long time from when an idea becomes law even 
to the time that the spectrum is reallocated, so the sooner we 
start the better. But, yes, we need more spectrum. We should be 
thinking not just about the next 5 years but the next 10 and 20 
years of how we are going to transition incumbent users out to 
be able to make frequencies available.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;In your recent paper you noted there is skyrocketing global 
demand for mobile wireless services. And with the coming of 5G 
it is important to find spectrum to fuel that growth.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    The two bands you discuss are complementary to AWS-3 
spectrum, which was auctioned for over $40 billion. You 
estimate the two bands you have discussed could auction over 
$62 billion. What drives the price so high for these particular 
bands?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt; In this case I actually start with the prices
paid and the AWS auctions and reduce them a little bit to 
recognize that increased supply would reduce prices. In the 
case of this auction, there is about twice as much spectrum 
being auctioned, but I am only estimating about a 50 percent 
increase in price.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; Would you insist that they be auctioned
together?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt; The current estimate is based on the idea that
they are auctioned together and paired so that you have the 
uplink, downlink architecture in place, and I think that is 
still the highest valued use for the spectrum. At some future 
time, and it depends how far in the future, that may not be as 
important, but for now I think if you want to maximize the 
value you should pair them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; How would the mid-band spectrum identified by
the Commission in its recent NOI fare in this type of auction 
in your opinion, Dr. Bazelon?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;I am not sure which specific frequencies you
are referring to, but the need, I mean, I think as many of us 
have said, the need for mid-band spectrum in this new 
architecture is going to be high.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;    This is the spectrum--imagine in the denser areas, it 
doesn't have to be just urban but anywhere where there is 
enough people to deploy the high frequencies, there is going to 
be an expectation of large bandwidth, low latency, high 
connectivity, and as you move outside those areas you are not 
going to want your devices to stop working. That is actually 
going to put increased demand on these mid-band spectrum 
frequencies.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Mr. Pearson, as you mention in your testimony, several 
countries in Europe and Asia are taking concrete steps to make 
lower portions of the mid-band, specifically frequencies 
between 3 and 6 gigahertz, available for commercial 5G 
deployment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Do you believe policymakers here in the United States, 
including us, are doing an adequate job to make similar bands 
available for 5G?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;I think we are making progress in the United
States, and I think we need to do more. If you look at most of 
these countries, they are very proactive and aggressive in 
their planning processes and where they are directing their 
industry to go and their governments to go with the mid-bands, 
and specifically I would say the 3.5 band.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;    Recently I think we have made some steps here with the CBRS 
band to improve maybe the opportunity for investment in that, 
whether it is going to be LTE or 5G, and that is helpful. But I 
do think we need to do more in the United States, if you look 
at the competition from around the world and what they are 
doing, and the economies of scale that are going to happen in 
that band.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;And, Chairman, I yield back 40 seconds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Ms. Matsui, you are recognized.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Congressman Guthrie and I recently held a Spectrum Caucus 
event on 5G, and we had a great panel made up of leading 
wireless providers and a leading chip manufacturer, a leading 
software company, and a small rural wireless carrier.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Now, 5G will include spectrum but also rely on advanced 
chip sets, software capabilities, and other innovative 
technologies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Mr. Bazelon and Pearson and perhaps Mr. Broecker, do you 
think that blockchain, since you mentioned it, also will play a 
role in 5G and, specifically, to make efficient use of spectrum 
sharing?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt; I haven't examined the use of blockchain in
spectrum sharing. Clearly mechanisms that allow more users to 
share the same frequencies are going to increase the 
productivity of band to spectrum, and as demand on spectrum is 
increasing, anything that will help in that way will be useful. 
But I wouldn't want to comment specifically on blockchain.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Right. We are at the beginning stages then is
what you are saying with that. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Would you like to comment on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Broecker&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;I can't tell you what the technical details
are around blockchain, but I can tell you that it is going to 
be an important technology, just like the internet. The 
internet is the portal for communication and information, and I 
think blockchain will be the internet of value and asset 
exchange.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;    And so I think that the technical details are still--
blockchain is a still a cumbersome technology. But there are 
other companies that are rapidly trying to advance that 
technology to make it more widespread. And so I think just 
basic infrastructure requirements will have to increase, and I 
think 5G will be a part of that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;OK. Great. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    And also things like advanced chipsets and software 
capabilities I believe will play an important role, too. Is 
that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt; It has been compared to magic, this
technology. That is more true as time goes on.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;I know we have been talking about the mid-band spectrum, 
but it has unique propagation characteristics that make it 
ideal for reliable satellite distribution and particularly 
valuable for terrestrial mobile use. Wireless, fixed wireless, 
satellite services, and others have identified certain mid-
range bands as ideal for 5G operations. But we know there is 
considerable disagreement over the best mechanism to enable 5G 
deployments to utilize the spectrum, including in the C-band.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Mr. Bazelon, what would a market-based incentive that would 
allow incumbents to voluntarily clear portions of this band 
look like?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;So I understand that a joint proposal by Intel
and Intelsat was put forward that would allow the incumbent 
users--give them the authority to negotiate with new 
terrestrial wireless users. And although I have worked with 
those companies on this issue, I have not developed--worked on 
developing the mechanisms.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;    But the principle behind it, that the incumbent users will 
benefit from their efforts of participating in the process and 
making the spectrum available I think is the key part to having 
it happen in a timely manner.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt; So you think it is possible to devise rules for
these bands so that you can protect incumbent operations while 
also allowing mobile broadband use?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;Yes. I mean, in some cases it is about, say,
cordoning off geographic areas that are going to be protected. 
It may be about taking an earth station out an urban area and 
moving to it a rural area and then connecting it back with a 
fiber optic cable and that way you are able to geographically 
partition the spectrum.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt;    These are really all quite complicated issues with how this 
band could evolve, and it is the incumbent satellite carriers 
and the new terrestrial wireless carriers that will know best 
how to work that out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;One of the spectrum bands the FCC is examining
in its mid-band inquiry is--wait a minute. No, I want to go 
this one here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;The Citizens Broadband Radio Service, the 3.5 megahertz 
band, as co-chair with Representative Guthrie of the Spectrum 
Caucus, we are very focused on the opportunity that this 
particular band will offer. A mix of low-, mid-, and high-band 
spectrum is necessary both for wireless coverage today and to 
build network capacity in the future; 3.5 gigahertz can be a 
significant component of mid-range bands that facilitate 5G 
network deployment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Mr. Pearson, do you think there is a way to ensure this 
band is open to every innovative wireless opportunity it 
intends to promote?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;Yes. Number one, I think when you talk about
the opportunity for that band in 5G, it is a band that, again, 
is a great emphasis if you go around the world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;Now, as far as the improvements that can be made in that 
band for investment, I mean, from a mobile wireless industry 
side, I think we need, as we have seen, longer license terms, 
larger geographic areas, and so forth, and the expectation of 
renewal on those licenses. That is where you get investment in 
our industry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;    And if you go around the world there are very few other 
geographic or other countries that have some of the issues that 
we have with the Navy radar and so forth. So they are looking 
at that as pretty much clean spectrum of them moving forward 
with for 5G.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Matsui&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;OK. Great.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;Thank you very much, and I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Ms. Matsui"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. Mr. Shimkus, you are recognized, 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;I am glad Peter Welch is still here, and I hate to say he 
is right sometimes, but all he does is kind of give voice to 
frustration in rural America that we just don't get there. But 
I would also argue that there are still some regulatory issues 
with maintaining copper wires that we should have a discussion 
about, reforming the Universal Service Fund. I think Mr. 
Adelstein talks about RUS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;I mean, there are tools, it is just we have got to refine 
those, and I would be happy to work with you on those things. 
So it is very frustrating out there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    Ms. Santosham, I mean, the real debate for me is industry 
getting in or the concern of municipalities blocking. So how 
large is San Jose?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; It is a little over a million people.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt; And these other communities are now part--they
must be smaller. Do you know the size of the Kansas----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; Lanexa and Valdosta. I think Valdosta is
about 40,000. I am not sure about Lanexa.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt; OK. And so your 5G, for lack of a better word,
desert, or areas that you want to go to that are not served, 
the Latino community that you were mentioning, do you know the 
population area of that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; I don't, but I am happy to get back to you
on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;My basic point is that is probably bigger than
most of my communities. That area that should be of your 
concern. I am not saying as a municipal leader. If I was a 
municipal leader I would be concerned about that. And sometimes 
in rural America that is bigger than--I have a county that only 
has 5,000 people in it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;So it goes to that debate of how do you get there and get 
deployed. This is a different era than coaxial cables and 
access to poles, which is kind of how this original--how did 
municipalities then give right-of-ways, leverage for dollars 
and access, versus affixing pizza boxes or refrigerators in 
local communities to provide this service.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;So in 2009 the FCC said we should have a shot clock to help 
some deployment, and that shot clock was--the Supreme Court 
supported that in a decision in 2013 and which is kind of the 
law of the land.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    But, Mr. Adelstein, even with the shot clock and the ruling 
and with the Supreme Court, are you still perceiving that there 
are problems in market entry?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Well, there is still a problem with the shot
clock if it is not deemed granted at the end, because you have 
to go to Federal Court, and then it is an endless loop that you 
end up there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;This committee was responsible for, as I mentioned, 
enacting 6409(a), which allowed the FCC the authority, clear 
authority to say at the end of the process, if a locality won't 
allow a colocation, it is going to be deemed granted, and that 
means it gets done. We haven't had any pushback on that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;    But on these other shot clocks we have had numerous 
examples. As a matter of fact, the tendency is for the 
community to go beyond the shot clock and for our industry not 
to sue because we know we will be back at that community again 
later, and we know that the Federal court mechanism is not a 
particularly effective one. So we could use additional 
authority of the FCC to allow for deemed granted.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;And how would you--so, I mean, I guess you
answered it. Deem granting would be the provision that you 
think would help in that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    Ms. Santosham, you wanted to commend on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;Yes, I just want to take a little bit of a
step back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;    So the infrastructure that we are talking about now to 
deploy 5G is largely light pole infrastructure, infrastructure 
that is traditionally used for lights, maybe you put a banner 
up, right? They are not always structurally sound to put a 
heavy piece of equipment on, and they oftentimes need 
remediation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt; That is true, but if I may, in previous
hearings here we had talked about the ability of some of these 
things to be placed on the side of buildings.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; Yes, but by and large it will be mostly
street lights because of the density that you need to deploy 
the networks. And so when communities--when we say that the 
communities are taking a little bit longer it is partially 
because we are taking this 200-year-old infrastructure and then 
we have got to change the way that we have permitted and used 
that infrastructure.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt; I only have 12 seconds left, and I appreciate
that. I guess what we are trying to find is we need to have a 
balancing act. You want your folks to have 5G. We want our 
folks to have 5G.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; One quick point on San Jose. The State of
California enacted a deemed granted remedy for shot clocks. So 
San Jose is under that. And so if California can do it, the 
United States can do it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shimkus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chairman. I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Shimkus"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. Mr. McNerney, you are recognized for 5 
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;I want to thank the chairlady for the
hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;And I thank the witnesses. It has been interesting to hear 
what you have had to say.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Mr. Pearson, in your written testimony you emphasized the 
importance of U.S. leadership in the global race for 5G. At a 
hearing earlier this fall we heard that the Sinclair merger 
could delay the repack of the 600-megahertz band, slowing down 
5G deployment and U.S. competitiveness.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;    Do you agree that it is important the FCC not take steps to 
delay the clearing of spectrum for 5G? Do you believe that that 
would hurt us?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt; I think that we should do everything we can to
clear the spectrum to put it to the best use, in this case 
mobile wireless. I think connecting society is some of the best 
uses.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; So the Sinclair merger, which may delay that,
would be an impediment in this case?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt; I would have to research that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;I know you are not an expert on that. I just
wanted to make that point. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;    Where are we in the standards-making process for 5G?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;In the standards?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;The standards are making great progress. What we are 
actually looking at is a draft of the first release of what is 
called--I don't want to get too technical--but of a first 
release of 5G at the end of this year. So everyone will know 
what kind of chipsets and silicon to start producing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;    That will be completed in early 2018. The second phase of 
5G will then be December of 2019, just in time for ITU to do 
their blessings in 2020.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; So is cybersecurity being taken into account
in the standards process?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt; Pardon me?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; Cybersecurity, is that a significant part of
the process?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt; Yes, it is. It is part of it. 3GPP has two
different areas that are working on--well, actually several, 
but several areas that are working on that and security is a 
mainstay for our industry, as well as the standard.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;    Ms. Santosham, in your written testimony you noted that the 
city of San Jose has deployed an Internet of Things network. 
How important is IoT data security, for example, that devices 
be patchable and downloadable?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; It is incredibly important. You know, data
is the new oil, and cybersecurity is incredibly important to 
our cities. Cities will be obviously a target for cyber 
threats. And privacy is also of concern.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Good. I personally believe that digital
device security is critical and that we are late in the game on 
this process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Earlier this year I introduced the Securing IoT Act, which 
would require that cybersecurity standards be developed for IoT 
devices and that those devices be certified. I hope that the 
committee takes up this legislation soon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;    Ms. Santosham, I am aware of the many benefits that the 5G 
has to offer, including faster speeds, but I am worried about 
the costs. For my constituents, there is a real concern because 
more than 21 percent of my households earn less than $25,000 a 
year. How do you expect the 5G deployment to impact the cost of 
wireless services?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; Today there are no guarantees that cost to
consumers will go down, and cost of service and cost of devices 
are the top two barriers to digital inclusion. And I think when 
we are talking about subsidizing infrastructure deployment 
rates for large corporations we should be asking for something 
back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; Well, you mentioned, I think, you had 75,000
residents that don't have broadband access in San Jose. If the 
Federal Communications Commission eliminates the Lifeline 
program today, how would that impact these and other residents 
in San Jose?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; Twenty-nine percent of our low income
residents only have access to the internet through mobile 
phones. And so if Lifeline goes away that will have a 
significant impact on their ability to be connected.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;Thank you. That is what I thought.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    Mr. Adelstein, you testified that the U.S. is in a position 
to retain our lead moving into 5G. Could you explain what that 
means exactly? What does it mean quantifiably that we have a 
lead in 5G?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; Well, the important thing is that other
countries are making it very easy to move forward. In Japan and 
Korea, for example, that are moving quickly toward 5G, they 
could site anything, anywhere, any time. And I am not saying we 
need that here because we have always worked in close 
partnership with localities, but some unreasonable impediments 
are going to slow down the deployment.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; What does leadership mean? What does that
mean?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; Usually it would mean that we would be the
first to implement the network. We would be ahead in terms of 
the chipsets, as we already are with our leading chipset 
manufacturers. We would be ahead with the devices that we get 
into the hands of consumers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt; I mean, could we include rural access as a
part of that definition of leadership in this field?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Ideally it would. I mean, we talked earlier
about the issues with rural, which is expensive. I mean, the 
greater costs you have to deploy this, the less likely we are 
to get to rural and the longer it will take.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;    I mean, rural historically has been the last to get these 
devices, and it is unfortunate, but the costs are extremely 
high to provide this type of network. And we need to do 
everything we can to lower those costs to allow that capital 
budget that the companies do have, which is the largest of any 
industry, 30 billion a year being invested, and a lot of that 
in rural America.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McNerney&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;My time has expired, and I am sure the chair
is anxious to move on. So thank you for the answer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Mrs. Brooks for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Thank you Madam Chairwoman. Thank you so much 
for holding this hearing today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;Mr. Broecker, wonderful to have you here. You noted in your 
testimony the exponential growth of the Internet of Things, 
which we have talked about a bit--smart devices, wearables, and 
sensors, and thank you for sharing with us the issue of the new 
discovery and use of the digital pill--will increasingly be 
part of the delivery of care to improve patients' lives. We 
have had quite a discussion also about rural America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. McNerney"&gt;    How do you believe that these innovations are going to have 
the power to bring better care, better healthcare to patients 
in rural areas? I represent rural areas, as well, in central 
Indiana. And do you have any specific examples of scenarios 
where 5G can improve that doctor-patient relationship and 
improve the delivery of care in rural areas?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Broecker&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;Absolutely. You know, there is an emerging
trend, and it is increasing, and it is the notion of 
telemedicine where patients don't actually have to go to a 
hospital or to a doctor's office and through internet 
connection and other technology-enabled solutions they can have 
a consult.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;There is robotic surgeries occurring where surgeons in 
completely different parts of the United States can be doing 
surgery in a hospital someplace else.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;So as I mentioned in my testimony, healthcare is going to 
be driven less about place and more about the connection to a 
healthcare system, and that doesn't necessarily need to be 
right next door. I mean, it is great if it is, but there are 
going to be technologies and solutions and innovations that are 
going to allow people and patients and healthcare systems and 
physicians to be connected in completely different ways.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Switching gears a little bit to the focus that 
you put on automation of manufacturing and that 5G will result 
in even more automation, some become nervous about increased 
automation as it relates to jobs and the people on the 
manufacturing floor, so to speak. And we also know automation 
increases speeds and efficiency of manufacturing to create 
these jobs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;    Are there any policy areas Congress should be looking at to 
help the workforce adapt as we continue to push and believe in 
the importance of implementation of 5G to the world of 
innovation, automation, and manufacturing? What should Congress 
be doing for the workforce and how do we help the workforce 
adapt?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Broecker&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;I mean, the general trend is toward STEM
education and enhanced STEM education and starting early in a 
student's life, whether that is in grade school or high school 
and getting involved in things like robotics and getting 
familiar with technology. You can now do biology genome 
experiments in eighth grade, whereas before you needed to have 
a Ph.D. and be at MIT, where I went to school. These things are 
now possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;But it really gets back to an educated workforce, starting 
with the next generation. But it also means skills and 
developing the skills amongst the current workforce to be able 
to do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;You know, I said I started off in manufacturing, and I saw 
lots of innovation come over my 20-plus-year career. And the 
same debate was argued, you know, OK, we are going to get all 
these fancy pieces of equipment and machines to do the work. It 
never replaced people. At the end of the day it still took 
people overseeing, managing, making sure that the machines did 
what they were supposed to do. But it takes an educated 
workforce in order to do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;I am going to yield back the balance of my time so others 
can ask their questions. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. Thanks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt;    Ms. Eshoo, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Eshoo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;And thank you to all of the witnesses. It is good to see 
Jonathan again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;And a very warm welcome to Ms. Santosham from San Jose, 
California. I think you gave very important testimony today. 
And I appreciate the warm words that you directed toward me, 
and I return them to you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;First, I want to make a couple of comments about the whole 
issue of 5G. I believe that it has--it holds the potential for 
many benefits, and several of you have mentioned them, and how 
it will lead to competition and bridging the digital divide and 
unlock the Internet of Things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;So I think that it represents a real opportunity for all of 
us. And of course I always say I am not satisfied with America 
being 5th or 12th or 17th. I want us to be number one and lead 
the world in whatever it is, whatever the undertaking is, and 
whatever the sector is. And obviously we are all going to have 
to work together to move in a direction that is going to make 
this a reality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;But I am also concerned that there are some things that are 
being pushed aside in the race to 5G. And I want to associate 
myself with some of the comments that both our ranking member, 
Mr. Doyle, and also Mr. Welch made.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;We have two problems, two big problems. And I think that as 
we move forward with this and any other initiative that has 
anything to do with spectrum, which is the gold in all of this, 
because there is an insatiable appetite for it, and as we 
continue to innovate, you have to have spectrum. Spectrum is 
the platform, it is the fuel that makes everything go.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;But Mr. Welch spoke about one. How do we assure that there 
is accessibility in rural communities? No matter what we do, 
this issue keeps coming up. We are not making progress there. I 
mean, it is like the 10,000-pound gorilla in the room.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;I also have concerns about how we are going to deal with 
local communities. I have a reverence for local government. I 
came from it. I spent a decade in local government. We cannot 
run roughshod over local government. And I think that there is, 
most frankly, a rush to do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;In fact, what Mr. Doyle raised about how did San Jose get 
this reputation and this attack on them for being whatever, I 
don't know where that came from. But it seems to me, because 
you raised your voice about, wait a minute, we have to be 
considered in this, we have citizens that we need to respond 
to, and you can't just run roughshod over us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;So to Ms. Santosham--first of all, I want to ask for 
unanimous consent to place in the record a New York Times 
editorial by the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, dated 10/3/
17, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;Mr. Lance [presiding]. So ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Eshoo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;Wireless providers have been accused of
redlining certain neighborhoods, a practice that obviously 
exacerbates the digital divide. And I would like you to comment 
on that, but also tell us what the importance of cities like 
San Jose is implementing market-based infrastructure leases to 
ensure that private industry is enhancing broadband access for 
all communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;It is not just San Jose. San Jose is speaking up. But they 
have an issue, and they are not rural, of 95,000 people in 
their city that have nothing. They have no access to it. This 
is the largest city in Silicon Valley.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;    So would you comment on that? Because I find that deeply 
disturbing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;Yes. So, first of all, market-based rates
and incentives are things we should all believe in. And there 
is a little bit of an irony that we as a city government are 
asking for market-based rates and the private sector is asking 
for cost-based.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;And market-based rates allow us to incentivize buildouts, 
especially when we are allowed to build out entire communities. 
So we are able to say: Hey, hereis all the space in the city we 
would like to build out, and we will give you a discount on 
some of this infrastructure if you are willing to go to the 
communities that need to be served.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt;    And so I think that is what is missing in this 
conversation, is by speeding the deployment and running 
roughshod over local government you are then taking away the 
ability to shape and manage where deployment happens in 
communities so that communities benefit.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Eshoo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt; So is the BDAC the place where this will be
decided?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; The BDAC? I don't think so, but I am
concerned about the direction there because of the lack of 
representation both on the voting body and in the subgroups.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Eshoo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;I wrote to the chairman about that. And I think
if you have mostly industry people then it is just going to be 
weighted that way. I am not opposed to industry people, but you 
have to have some kind of balance in this. And that is another 
red flag.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;Thank you to all of you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;I think, Mr. Chairman, that more work needs to be done in 
the areas that have been raised. They are legitimate concerns. 
I don't think it is a Republican or a Democratic concern. I 
think they are concerns that we need to build in solutions so 
that they are addressed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;And I think that then the promise that is being spoken of 
here today about 5G will be kept. Otherwise we are going to 
have another new generation but plagued with the same issues 
that we keep talking about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt;    So thank you. And I thank you for your patience in giving 
me extra time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania, 
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    Could all of you share a little bit about WiFi enabled by 
unlicensed spectrum and what role that may play in the 5G 
world?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pearson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;Well, if you look at the standard in what they
are going to be doing in 5G, they are actually including 
unlicensed spectrum in the 5G.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;Now, when you start specifically, you say WiFi, well, WiFi 
is actually integration--has integration capabilities right now 
with LTE. There is also LTE in a license, again separate from 
WiFi.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Pearson"&gt;    So all of these things are being done for basically to 
provide the consumer the best experience they can. Sometimes it 
is anchored with what would be LTE today and at some point 
would be 5G. Sometimes it is specifically unlicensed, which 
would be only WiFi. And other times it is actually another type 
of aggregation tool of interoperating. But it is usually one or 
the other.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bazelon&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Bazelon"&gt; WiFi is a very important access technology,
and unlicensed spectrum is very important to allow for that. 
And there is clearly a lot of demand for it. And it should be 
something that grows. Whether or not it ends up being actually 
integrated in with the commercial mobile networks I think is 
just an open question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; Some of the high frequency spectrum that is
being set aside is being set aside for unlicensed use, and that 
allows for individuals to use that to offload some of the 
demand that is going on in the broader networks that are being 
designed by the cellular industry. So it is very helpful to 
have unlicensed and licensed in a proper balance.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Santosham&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Ms. Santosham"&gt; I am going to defer to my colleagues here
who know much more about the issue than me.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Broecker&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Broecker"&gt; Same.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; We have heard a lot about State and local
impediments to the deployment of wireless infrastructure. Is 
the same true for next-generation wireline infrastructure?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;Well, fiber is a major part of 5G. I mean,
5G really can't function to its highest potential without fiber 
because of the latency requirements.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;So virtually every one of these little antennas is going to 
have a fiber connection. We are talking about potentially 
millions of antennas, if not hundreds of thousands. The 
estimates range between those. And so you are talking about 
very many antennas close to the end user, all of which require 
fiber connections.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;So impediments to the deployment of fiber are impediments 
to the deployments of 5G. And we do see those. We see those as 
well as--sometimes I think when the antenna gets attached at 
the end there is even more resistance for a number of different 
reasons from localities, even though they provide such a great 
opportunity for consumers and there is so much demand for it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;    So we do need policies, such as Dig Once, that allow for a 
fiber deployment to take place rapidly, because I think we are 
going to see another huge build-out of fiber in the United 
States preparing for 5G.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; So your testimony is that wireline equipment
does also face delays in permitting and access to rights of 
way?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt; It certainly does, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; I have one more question. Can you, Mr.
Adelstein, share with me your familiarity with the way that 
spectrum transactions between various companies and the need to 
be able to do through like kind exchange?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Adelstein&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;The FCC has done a very good job of allowing
for a very fluid secondary market in spectrum, and they readily 
approve transactions that are within the caps that they have 
placed that are informal. They can go beyond that if they have 
to. So they have really done a great job on a bipartisan basis 
and under both administrations of allowing for a very fluid 
secondary market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Adelstein"&gt;    I mean, our concern right now is getting more spectrum into 
market. And the issue is with 5G, you have understood there is 
this bill that is needed to get it done. Because we would like 
to see by December 2018 the opportunity for the FCC to hold an 
auction of these high frequency bandwidths. And if it is 
possible the chipsets will be ready by then, the equipment will 
be ready, the standards will be in place. So if we can get the 
Guthrie-Matsui bill through that would pave way for even more 
high frequency spectrum that could then be put into that mix.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Good. Thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you very much, Congressman Costello.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Does anyone else on the committee wish to ask further 
questions?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Seeing there are no further questions from members, I thank 
our witnesses for being here today. It has been a very 
informative panel by a distinguished group of guests.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Before we conclude, I ask unanimous consent to enter the 
following letters into the record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;The recently released white paper from the Brattle Group.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;A letter from Mayor Kevin Davis of Hardin
County, Tennessee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; And thank you, Dr. Bazelon, for the white paper.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Eshoo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt; Mr. Chairman?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Eshoo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"&gt; May I just add my best wishes to everyone here--
I know the committee is all gone, but in absentia--for a 
wonderful Thanksgiving. We have much to be grateful for in our 
great and good country. So happy Thanksgiving.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you, and I share that sentiment. And among
the major holidays it is my favorite holiday because it is the 
traditional American holiday.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;And to all in the audience, I certainly agree with 
Congresswoman Eshoo.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Pursuant to committee rules, I remind members that they 
have 10 business days to submit additional questions for the 
record. And I ask that witnesses submit their responses within 
10 business days upon receipt of the questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Seeing no further business before the subcommittee today, 
without objection, the subcommittee is adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;[Whereupon, at 11:40 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;[Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
