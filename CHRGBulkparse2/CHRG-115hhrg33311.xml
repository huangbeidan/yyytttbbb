Administration for today's Committee markup. A quorum is 
present, so we may proceed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker=""&gt;The meeting record will remain open for 5 legislative days 
so Members may submit any materials they wish to be included 
therein.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker=""&gt;    [The information follows:]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker=""&gt;    The Chairman. We are here today to formally approve &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker=""&gt;[The information follows:]
Committee Resolution 115-20 to update the townhall meeting 
regulations found in the Members' Congressional Handbook.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker=""&gt;The current handbook regulations allows Members of the 
House to co-host in-person townhall meetings with Members 
representing adjacent congressional districts. This handbook 
update will allow Members of the House to co-host telephone and 
internet or virtual townhall meetings with another Member even 
if the congressional districts are not adjacent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker=""&gt;This update will offer additional flexibility to Members 
when communicating with their constituents via virtual townhall 
meetings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker=""&gt;    I would now like to recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. 
Brady, for the purpose of providing an opening statement if he 
desires.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Brady&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I support the Committee resolution before us 
today. This change to our Members' handbook will allow Members 
to communicate with their constituents about regional issues, 
allowing constituents more meaningful access to their 
government. I appreciate the bipartisan work in developing this 
proposal, and I urge my colleagues to support it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Thank you, Mr&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr"&gt;Brady.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr"&gt;    I would ask if any other Member of the Committee wishes to 
be recognized for the purpose of providing an opening 
statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lofgren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt; Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. I recognize the gentlewoman from California&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="The Chairman. I recognize the gentlewoman from California"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lofgren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;I don't have an opening statement, but I just
wanted to clarify--I think it is permitted, but I wanted to get 
it on the record--that you could have more than one adjacent 
Member.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;For example, I had a townhall meeting once where there were 
three Members who were adjacent to each other on a topic, held 
at the county, you know, board chambers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;So this is not restricted to two if there are--in an urban 
area, for example, there are oftentimes more than two who are 
adjacent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;    And, with that clarification, I would yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;    The Chairman. The Chair would agree with that &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;    And, with that clarification, I would yield back.
interpretation. As long as they are adjacent, it can be more 
than two.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lofgren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;    The Chairman. Anyone else?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;I now call up and lay before the Committee Resolution 115-
20 to prove the update to the Members' Congressional Handbook.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;Without objection, the first reading of the resolution is 
dispensed with, and the resolution is considered read and open 
for amendment at any point.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;    [The resolution follows:]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;    The Chairman. Is there any debate?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;[The resolution follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;Are there any Members who wish to offer an amendment to the 
resolution?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;If not, I move the Committee adopt the resolution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;The question is on the motion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;All those in favor, signify by saying aye.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;Opposed, say nay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the 
motion is agreed to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon 
the table.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;Without objection, the markup is adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Ms. Lofgren"&gt;[Whereupon, at 11:27 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
