    &lt;paragraph paraId="0" speaker=""&gt;HON. WILBUR ROSS, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The
Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee 
hearing will come to order.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;First, I would like to welcome our witness, Commerce 
Secretary Ross, who is here with us this morning to discuss the 
Department of Commerce's fiscal year 2019 budget request.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Secretary Ross, we are happy to have you here and we want 
to thank you for your service to the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;This is our first hearing of the year, so I want to remind 
our members that we will, as usual, follow the 5-minute rule, 
and I will, of course, not cut anybody off mid-sentence. We 
will recognize members in the order of seniority in which they 
have arrived at the hearing, going back and forth between the 
parties. And for latecomers, I will recognize you in the order 
in which you have arrived at the hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;And while I am sure we will not always agree on the issues 
before the subcommittee, all members and witnesses will be 
heard and respected. And we always on this committee work 
together in a collegial and cordial manner, and always manage 
to find a way to get our work done, because this subcommittee 
is pure good, all the things that we do are pure good.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;And I want to get back to the matter at hand. In the last 
year, the Department of Commerce forecasted and responded to 
the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season, which included Hurricane 
Harvey in Houston, which is the largest housing disaster in the 
history of the country. I have still got tens of thousands of 
constituents who are living on the second floor of their homes, 
were forced to move. The disaster was just catastrophic. And 
the Weather Service, as a part of their forecast fleet, 
launched flagship weather satellites, NOAA-20 and GOES-17, as 
well as released an updated cost estimate for the census, which 
is the first thing I want to visit about this morning, Mr. 
Secretary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;We expect this diverse work to continue in 2019 when the 
Commerce Department will continue to execute its important 
missions, including preparing for the 2020 census; forecasting 
the weather; managing our fisheries; exploring the oceans, 
which is especially important in this era when the Chinese 
control 98 percent of all rare earth elements produced on 
earth. We have got the exclusive economic zone of the United 
States, which expands the area of the United States by about 50 
percent and contains vast amounts of rare earth elements. The 
Department also administers our patent and trademark laws.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;And, in executing these missions, Mr. Secretary, we hope 
you will continue to bring your extraordinary skill set and 
innovative cost-saving ideas from the private sector to the 
Department. I am especially interested in hearing any 
suggestions you have got on how the subcommittee can help you 
give you more authority to do what you do best and that is to 
achieve efficiency, productivity, and to make not only the 
Census Bureau, but the entire Department run more efficiently 
and effectively.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;The budget recommendation, which was developed by OMB 
before there was an agreement on adjusting the budget caps, 
proposes reshaping the Department to focus on the highest-
priority missions, while significantly reducing funding for 
other activities across the Department. We will carefully 
consider the President's budget request to ensure that we are 
responsibly funding critical Department of Commerce activities 
while protecting our constituents' very precious, very scarce, 
and hard-earned tax dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;In this hearing and in the coming months, I look forward to 
discussing how we can work together to ensure that the 2020 
census and weather satellite programs are staying within their 
projected costs and achieving their important goals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Before we proceed, I would like to recognize my colleague 
and good friend Mr. Serrano for any remarks that he would like 
to make.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I would like to
join you in welcoming the Secretary of Commerce, the Honorable 
Wilbur Ross, back to the subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;The Department of Commerce is vital in promoting job 
creation and opportunity for all; understanding our planet; 
ensuring fair trade conditions for our businesses and workers; 
providing accurate data to our nation's lawmakers and 
businesses; and assisting under-served and economically 
distressed communities. Unfortunately, the budget request 
undermines several of these key missions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;The President's budget for fiscal year 2019 requests $9.8 
billion for the Department of Commerce, which is $573 million 
or a 6.2 percent increase from the 2017 enacted level. This 
level of funding, while an increase from last year's request, 
endangers core missions at the Department.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;For example, the budget once again, very foolishly, 
proposes the elimination of critical agencies and programs such 
as the Economic Development Administration and Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership or MEP Program. EDA is the only agency 
across the Federal Government that focuses exclusively on 
economic development and economically distressed areas around 
the Nation, while the MEP equips our small and medium-size 
manufacturers with the resources needed to grow and to thrive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;It is estimated that for every $1 of Federal investment the 
MEP national network generates $17.90 in new sales growth for 
manufacturers and $27 in new client investment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;In short, this program enhances the productivity and 
competitiveness of small and medium-size manufacturers and 
creates well-paying jobs, while reducing our trade deficit with 
other countries. It is also an agency with strong bipartisan 
support in Congress, which demonstrates how politically tone 
deaf this proposal is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Another agency that is severely cut by more than 70 percent 
is the Minority Business Development Agency. This agency 
promotes the growth of minority-owned businesses and helps them 
compete in the world economy, and it is the only Federal agency 
with this focus.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;The budget also proposes a $43 million cut to the U.S. 
Commercial Service, and calls for the closing of 35 posts 
overseas and ten U.S.-based Export Assistance Centers. This 
program supports and creates American jobs by helping U.S. 
businesses and workers to export more products.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;These budget cuts, if enacted, will hurt small businesses 
and workers in economically distressed areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;In a different area, the President's budget severely 
undermines NOAA's mission by decreasing its funding by more 
than $1 billion, a more than 19-percent decrease. In 
particular, the budget proposes to zero out funding in targeted 
NOAA grants and programs that support coastal and marine 
management research and education benefitting industry, States, 
and local stakeholders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;The Regional Coastal Resilience Grants, for instance, 
ensure that our states and communities are prepared to face 
changing ocean conditions, from acidification to sea level 
rise, as well as major catastrophes. We need to make sure that 
we are here to help our coastal communities to be more 
resilient in the face of climate change and we must allow our 
marine research programs to continue as necessary for America's 
economic and environmental health.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;I am particularly concerned about the status of 
preparations for the 2020 census, which is behind in schedule 
and has been under funded. There are major issues that are 
still unresolved that will impact the rollout and response 
process, including a lack of permanent leadership, that the 
Bureau fears that we have not sufficiently tested in urban and 
minority-language communities, and the need to quickly ramp up 
outreach in traditionally under-counted areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;I am also deeply troubled about a highly political request 
that the Department of Justice made to the Department last 
December, asking the Bureau to add a question on citizenship 
status to the form. This question was not previously considered 
or tested by the Bureau, nor was it included in last year's 
report to Congress on the topics to be included in the 2020 
census.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Including such a question would drive response rates down 
in minority and immigrant communities, increasing costs and 
harming accuracy. Unfortunately, this request seems purely 
partisan, as evidenced by yesterday's email from the Trump 
campaign attempting to fund raise off this very issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;It is also important to note that none of the affected 
communities asked for this question to be included in the 2020 
census.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Congresswoman Meng and I wrote to you in a letter earlier 
this year and made these points to you. I look forward to 
hearing more from you on these issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;There are many, many other issues that we have to discuss, 
Secretary Ross, but understand that our desire is to make the 
Department respond more efficiently and more properly, it is 
never to be adversaries, unless we see real harm being done. 
But we are worried, very worried on this side about the census 
asking questions that will undermine the count rather than 
build the count up to where it should be.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Serrano.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Mr. Secretary, we are delighted to have you here with us 
this morning and we look forward to hearing your summary of 
testimony, and your written testimony will be entered into the 
record in its entirety, if there is no objection.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. We look
forward to hearing from you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Statement of the Secretary of Commerce&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Secretary Ross. Thank you, Chairman Culberson, Ranking 
Member Serrano, and members of the House Appropriations 
subcommittee. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss 
President Trump's fiscal year 2019 budget request for the U.S. 
Department of Commerce.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;And thank you for enabling the Department to meet its major 
strategic objectives of helping the American economy grow and 
ensuring our national security. We are accomplishing this by 
preparing for a successful 2020 Decennial Census; providing the 
observational infrastructure and personnel to develop timely 
and accurate weather forecasts; by supporting investment in job 
creation, and helping American businesses and industries 
compete globally in a fair and secure environment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;To that end, the Department of Commerce's fiscal year 2019 
budget request of $9.8 billion in funding is a 6-percent 
increase from the fiscal year 2018 continuing resolution. It 
does not include the $1 billion that was recently appropriated 
to the Department as part of the Supplemental Assistance 
Package enacted in the aftermath of the severe storms in Texas, 
Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;The fiscal year 2019 budget makes key strategic 
investments. A few highlights. The 2020 Decennial Census is the 
Department's top priority. A complete and accurate Decennial 
Census is critical, as it informs the policymaking process and 
apportionment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;To support this critical endeavor, the Department's fiscal 
year 2019 budget requests $3.8 billion for the Census Bureau, 
$3.1 billion of which will directly support 2020 census 
operations. The proposed $2.3 billion increase from the fiscal 
year 2018 continuing resolution reflects the Department's 
commitment to count everyone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;With its $1.6 billion request for the National 
Environmental Satellite and Data Information Service, NOAA will 
continue its work to deploy the next generation of weather 
satellites and observational infrastructure. These satellites 
will provide faster, more accurate, and more detailed data than 
legacy satellites to track storm systems, lightning, wildfires, 
coastal fog, and other hazards.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;When President Trump tapped me to serve as the Commerce 
Secretary, I vowed to work hard to reduce the nation's trade 
deficit. Increased enforcement of our trade laws has been a 
major effort in this regard. We requested $440 million for the 
International Trade Administration. ITA will use the requested 
funding to hire more subject matter experts and enhance its 
trade enforcement and analysis capacity for anti-dumping and 
countervailing duty investigations, and in support of Section 
232 investigations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;ITA's budget includes more than $90 million, an increase of 
$6 million from 2018, for enforcement and compliance programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;To continue building on these important enforcement and 
national security initiatives, $121 million is requested for 
the Bureau of Industry and Security, an $8.9 million increase 
from the 2018 continuing resolution. BIS has a remarkably broad 
impact on our national security and this increased funding will 
enable them to hire additional staff to address an increased 
workload.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;The fiscal year 2019 budget seeks to transform the Minority 
Business Development Agency into a policy-focused operation 
that can better assist minority business across America. 
Consistent with this transformation, the budget proposes to 
eliminate funding for MBDA's business centers. Instead, MBDA's 
fiscal year 2019 budget will allot its present 50 positions for 
this new endeavor no change in number of personnel, which will 
ensure minority entrepreneurs have access to the resources they 
need to create jobs and help fuel our nation's prosperity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;These are just a few highlights from our fiscal year 2019 
budget submission. I look forward to getting into more detail 
with you as you ask your questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;                          2020 CENSUS FUNDING
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;As you mentioned, the census is constitutionally required 
and the Department is preparing ramp-up activities for the 2020 
census. About 70 percent of those costs will be incurred over 
the next two fiscal years and the Department now estimates the 
total cost will be over $15 billion, an increase of 3 billion 
from the previous cost estimate. And I know you are doing 
everything within your power to ensure that our constituents' 
very precious, hard-earned, and scarce tax dollars are spent 
frugally and effectively on the census.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;And I would like to ask you, what could this committee do 
to help you and empower you to do what you think you need to do 
to make the Department, and the census in particular, more 
efficient and productive, and what steps are you taking to 
contain the costs of the 2020 census, and to make sure that the 
IT systems are cost-efficient and secure?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, thank you. Those are very, very good 
questions, Mr. Chairman. I will especially try to address what 
are we doing to try to make sure we live up to the budget I 
just presented.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;As you know, the original budget submitted well before my 
time severely underestimated some of the costs that would be 
involved and severely overestimated the economic benefits that 
would come from changes in technology.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;I have been devoting quite a bit of my personal time, as 
has Karen Dunn-Kelly and as has the Career Management, who is 
now in charge on an acting basis of the census day-to-day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;To give you a little example of the differences between how 
things were run before and how they are run now, we have 
developed a monthly monitoring system, which is illustrated 
here; it shows the actual progress in the workload and actual 
monies expended, in both cases relative to our forecast. We 
also have routine census-critical path reports with a summary 
of the technical integration status, again, actual versus 
budget and results versus projected results, and we do that in 
every single sub-segment of all of the budget categories.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;None of those processes and procedures had been used in the 
2010 census and none, frankly, had been used prior to our 
administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;In addition, we have a critical path system that we follow. 
The green, which happily dominates this whole diagram, are ones 
that are on schedule and on or below budget. The orange colors 
are those about which we are somewhat concerned. You will see 
they are relatively few and relatively small at this early 
stage. There are no red ones, which so far means there are none 
that we view as being in very serious danger of big overruns.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    The reason we are indulging in such intense measurement is 
it is my belief that what you can't measure, you can't manage. 
So we are trying in excruciating detail to manage the 
intricacies of the costs. This is one of the most complicated 
management tasks that will confront any government agency, the 
introduction of all these new technologies and the act of 
hiring over 500,000 enumerators part-time to do the census in 
2020. The hiring was not such a huge task in 2010, because the 
country was unfortunately in a recession, so there were plenty 
of people available. In 2020, we are liable to have a much more 
difficult time hiring people. And so one of the big tasks ahead 
of us is how to accomplish finding that many people, getting 
them trained with the technology, and getting them out there to 
do faithfully the enumeration of every person where that person 
resides.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Right. I know that FEMA has had difficulty
hiring inspectors and adjusters to come out and inspect homes 
for people affected by the hurricanes----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Secretary Ross. Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Mr. Culberson [continuing]. For that very same reason, but 
the reforms that you have put in place, commonsense, good 
business practices, I know all of us are very grateful for that 
and you have seen results. And I am confident you have a lot of 
very competent people at the Census Bureau and in the 
Department who you probably discovered just hadn't had the 
scrutiny or the oversight, or the measurement, as you said 
before, of their work, which sounds like you are heading in the 
right direction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;So you are encouraged. What are some of the frustrations 
you have encountered in your first year at the Department of 
Commerce that differ from what you saw in the private sector 
and what could this committee do to help give you greater 
authority to help manage and encourage productivity at the 
Department?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, I think the main thing the committee 
could do would be, we intend to prepare a very detailed 
accounting of lessons learned as we complete the 2020 census 
and we hope that that will form a basis for continued guidance 
by the committee as we move toward the 2030 census, because the 
2030 census will be conducted in a somewhat different fashion 
even from the 2020 based on what we have learned and based on 
the full application of technology and use of administrative 
records.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    The other thing would be, most importantly, to support our 
budget request. We feel that as to all the knowable unknowns, 
which may sound oxymoronic, but we have tried to risk-adjust 
our budget for the knowable unknowns. Given the complexity and 
the scale of this activity, there is a risk of unknowable 
unknowns, and that was why we had originally proposed a 10-
percent additional contingency of unallocated funds. That is 
not normal practice for an agency, but I wanted to remind 
everyone that was part of the request originally, it is not in 
the budget. We are going to try our level best to live without 
needing any contingency, but if something truly unknowable 
comes up, we may, unfortunately, have to come back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Mr. Secretary, very quickly, the Government
Accountability Office made 33 recommendations to improve the 
efficiency of the 2020 census and the Department has yet to 
implement those recommendations. Some of them go back to 2007. 
I know that is a source of frustration for you, sir. And I know 
when you were in the private sector, if your auditor told you 
to do something, you wouldn't wait 11 years to do it. When do 
you plan to implement them and what, if anything, can this 
committee do to help you in that effort?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, as to the GAO, they made 84 very 
detailed and very helpful, and, in my view, very useful 
recommendations. Of those, 51 have been closed as we sit here. 
Five are not due yet; by their very nature, they have a later 
due date than the present. There are 14 that are ongoing, life-
cycle cost estimates, so those cannot be completed until we get 
further----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross [continuing]. Into the process. Of the 
remaining 14, we have submitted documentation to GAO and we are 
hopeful that perhaps half of them could be resolved within the 
next month or so, and that the final seven hopefully could be 
resolved within 3 months. So that is where we stand precisely 
on the GAO recommendations. They have been very cooperative, 
very helpful, and we are very grateful for their support.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Since this is really extraordinarily
important, I know you have got it at the top of your list, and 
when do you expect to have a permanent director in place?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, first of all, I have total confidence 
in the long-term career people who are now the acting number 
one and number two in Census. They have combined 52 years of 
experience, so they are very, very thoroughly experienced in 
Census. And while they are not 100-percent accustomed to this 
kind of management process, the work with Karen Dunn-Kelly, 
myself, and outside consultants that we have brought in, both 
technology consultants and people with prior experience in the 
2010 and earlier censuses. So those are on an ongoing basis. We 
continually are scrubbing things; we meet quite regularly with 
the contractors and the subcontractors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    One of the many complexities here is that they decided to 
do a lot of subcontractors. There typically is a relatively 
small firm who was awarded the general contracting for a 
particular area and then some very large firms as 
subcontractors. Initially, that created some obscurity as to 
what was actually going on, because there wasn't direct 
interaction with the subcontractors. We have changed all that. 
We meet with the GC, we meet with the subcontractors on quite a 
regular basis, and have some, as the diplomats would say, frank 
and open discussions with them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt; Thank you very much.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Secretary Ross, I know from your testimony that you take 
the administration of the census very seriously and part of 
that duty is to administer in a nonpolitical, nonpartisan way, 
is that correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Should political parties and campaign politics
ever factor into what is asked of every household in the 
country on the census?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. No political party has asked us to do 
anything on the census. We have had a request, as everyone is 
aware, from the Department of Justice to add a citizenship 
question to the 2020 census.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you. The reasons I asked the first
question is because I was very disappointed to see yesterday 
that the Republican party campaign to reelect the President put 
out an appalling email specifically noting that the President 
wants a new citizenship question added to the census and 
seeking campaign supporters to weigh in if they are, quote, 
``on his side,'' end quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Do you disavow this campaign email? Has the President or 
anyone else in the White House directed you to add this or a 
similar question to the 2020 census?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Secretary Ross. I am not familiar with the email. I am not 
part of the Republican campaign committee, so I have not seen 
it; I have heard about it this morning. We are responding 
solely to the Department of Justice's request, not to any 
campaign request, not to any other political party request.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    We are listening to stakeholders, many have written to us, 
some have come in to talk with me, and we have initiated a cold 
series of phone calls to stakeholders on both sides of the 
question. We will come to a conclusion prior to March 31st, 
which as I understand it is the date by which we must submit 
the questions to the Congress. We will comply with that date. 
And we are going very, very carefully and very thoroughly, 
analyzing all aspects of the request and its implications for 
the census were it to be approved and were it not to be 
approved.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you. I am not a lawyer and certainly not
a constitutional lawyer----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Neither am I, sir. I am a civilian.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;OK. But the Constitution is pretty clear to
me, even though I am not a lawyer, it says count the people 
within the states, not the citizens. And some Federal agencies 
bring fear to people that are here as immigrants, who were not 
born here, and the purpose of the census should be to increase 
the count every 10 years, make it better, and this question 
troubles us a lot.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Mr. Secretary, staying on that line. In March 2017, the 
Department sent to Congress a list of subjects planned for the 
2020 census. Then in December of 2017, the Justice Department 
wrote to the Acting Director of the Census Bureau, asking that 
the Census Bureau include on the 2020 census questionnaire a 
question regarding citizenship. Many advocates and stakeholders 
have expressed strong concerns that including such a question 
will discourage many communities from participating in the 2020 
census.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Question, Mr. Secretary. Since this topic was not included 
in the March 2017 report to Congress on the topics to be 
covered in the 2020 census, may we assume that the Commerce 
Department itself is not supportive of adding this question?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Secondly, would you agree that it would be totally 
inappropriate to include any question that has not been 
thoroughly tested in the lead-up to the census?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Secretary Ross. We have not yet made a decision on the 
Department of Justice request. It is a very big and very 
controversial request. We are taking it very seriously, but I 
have not yet made a decision.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;I would like to address, though, what steps are we doing to 
make the 2020 census more accessible to people whose first 
language is not English, perhaps don't even have English as a 
language, what we are doing to call their attention to the 
census, to its importance, and to the privacy of their 
responses. So, if I may, I would like to describe a few of the 
steps that we are taking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;First of all, we are using many more languages in the 
census than was used in 2010. 2010 used as an alternative to 
English-Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Russian, five 
languages. We are including those five plus Arabic, Tagalog, 
Polish, French, Haitian-Creole, Portuguese, and Japanese. That 
is twelve languages versus five. That new list should cover 
95.3 percent of all those who are limited English speaking 
households in the country, so it is, for all practical 
purposes, everyone. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;\1\ Clerk's note: The Department of Commerce corrected this 
percentage of coverage to 87 percent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A paper questionnaire and mailing materials, every 
one of them will be immediately in both Spanish and in English. 
The additional support materials will be in 59 languages, 
including the ones that I mentioned before. And the ads and 
partnership material also will be quite multi-lingual. We also 
will have in the call centers multilingual people able to 
converse with folks in their native tongue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;So those are the things we are doing to try to make 
language less of a barrier to people's responses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;In terms of media, we are going to have far more, hundreds 
of millions of dollars more spending on the communications 
program, which is organized by Y&amp;amp;R. It will be multilingual. It 
in fact has included among its subcontractors firms who 
specialize in media for non-English language citizens and 
residents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Further, we are increasing the number of partnership 
specialists. Last time in 2010, there were 700 partnership 
specialists hired by the census; we will have 1,000 partnership 
specialists. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;\2\ Clerk's note: The Department of Commerece updated the number of 
partnership specialists in 2010 to be approximately 800.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;The partnership concept is one that embraces local 
community organizations, health organizations, local 
governments, all sorts of things, and we have already signed up 
local governments that constitute well over 90 percent of the 
population to cooperate with us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;In addition, for the first time we will be having kiosks in 
the U.S. Postal Service branches. I don't know how well you can 
see these, but there are big banners, 14-by-70-inches, going 
up, promoting the census. There will be an instruction booth 
that one can access on a computerized basis. There are table 
stands which will hold hand-helds, so that people can fill out 
the form.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;So we are doing everything to make this census more 
accessible to everybody regardless of native tongue or 
inclination. We are working very, very hard at it and I think 
it will produce good responses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;In addition, for the first time people have online response 
capacity; they are not required to respond online, but it is an 
additional facility. So now you can respond by Internet, by 
telephone, or by the physical, written document.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;And if all that fails, even after repeated mailings and 
repeated phone calls, we will have door-to-door enumerators 
coming multiple times.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    So, as a former enumerator myself, I can promise you I 
understand the process, I understand its importance, and we 
will get it done.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you. And I appreciate all that you are
doing to make this census a better census than any other 
before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Let me just close by saying this very briefly. We may have 
in this country, in fact we do, an immigration issue to deal 
with and it is going to take both parties to come together to 
resolve it, fix it, fix what is broken, but I don't think the 
census should be used to create more division, more fear, more 
hiding from people who should come forward and be counted. So, 
when you make your decision--I shouldn't tell you, you are a 
tough guy--don't be afraid to tell somebody, ``Have you read 
the Constitution?''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Serrano.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    I am pleased to recognize the gentleman from New Jersey, 
chairman of the full committee, Mr. Frelinghuysen.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. Great&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="The Chairman. Great"&gt;Welcome, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for
a distinguished career outside the responsibility you have 
taken on and I know you are a good spokesman for the present 
administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="The Chairman. Great"&gt;So let me direct this to your staff more than to you. I 
often say in my opening remarks that the power of the purse 
resides in this committee and of course the power of the purse 
affects public policy. And you and I have yet to be acquainted. 
You have been on the job for over a year. I say to the 
Secretary's staff, the power of the purse resides with this 
Committee, and I think it is about time that you and I became 
acquainted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="The Chairman. Great"&gt;I find it odd that we are engaged in a trade war, and you 
can tell from the tone of my voice what I think of it, but I 
respect the fact that you are extremely knowledgeable, and 
there has not been a consultation with the members of the 
Appropriations Committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="The Chairman. Great"&gt;I know we have great leadership, Chairman Culberson here, 
great leadership on Mr. Serrano's part, but, I worry as a 
Member of Congress representing Northern New Jersey where we 
have a lot of our major corporations, and as I travel around 
the world and see us stepping back from certain 
responsibilities militarily or in some cases taking on 
responsibilities that perhaps we shouldn't, I worry that now we 
are engaged in a trade war, which is further going to alienate 
us from our adversaries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="The Chairman. Great"&gt;So I just want to say for the record, I look forward to 
discussing some of these matters with you and appreciate your 
time and effort, but it is this committee that provides the 
resources for all of our trade negotiations and it might be 
good to recognize through maybe steps to follow after this 
hearing that the communications can be improved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="The Chairman. Great"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="The Chairman. Great"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Congressman Frelinghuysen, I will ask my 
staff this afternoon to talk with your staff and arrange for us 
to get together. I am sorry if we have not taken the initiative 
prior to this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt; I want to recognize the gentleman from
Washington State, Mr. Kilmer.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Mr.
Secretary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;It has come to my attention that several tribal leaders 
from my district have written to you and requested formal 
government-to-government consultation before a decision is made 
regarding the allocation of halibut quota in Area 2-A where 
these tribes hold treaty-reserved fishing rights under the 
Point Elliott Treaty of 1855.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    We have copies of the letters and, with the permission of 
the Chair and the Ranking Member, I would like to submit those 
for the record.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt; Yes, you may.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;The formal consultation process is part of the Federal 
Trust responsibility, it is an essential component of meeting 
our treaty obligations to Federally-recognized tribes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;So I would like to know how you have responded to these 
requests, whether you will commit to engaging in formal 
consultation with each of these affected tribes before 
finalizing any decision on rulemaking that will affect the 
allocation of halibut quota in that area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    Secretary Ross. As you know, the fisheries operation is 
part of NOAA and I have requested NOAA to engage with the 
tribal leaders.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Thank you. And do you know, will that be a
formal consultation?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Secretary Ross. NOAA is going to work that out with the 
leaders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;                     EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OPERATIONS
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;OK. On another note, the Export-Import Bank
doesn't have a quorum and it is unable to do deals over $10 
million and, as a consequence, there is over $35 billion in 
pending deals that are stuck in the pipeline without being able 
to be approved with a board quorum. Without a quorum, these 
deals are in jeopardy, which will result in the loss of 
American jobs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;So, two questions. One, do you agree that the Export-Import 
Bank needs to be fully operational; and, secondly, when will 
the Administration send a new chairman nominee?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, I am not aware that the 
Administration intends to send a new nominee or does not; I 
just am not aware where they stand. That is not a decision that 
will be made within Commerce, that is a decision that will be 
made solely within the White House.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;I am on record as suggesting that I do believe we need a 
financing mechanism to help us in international trade, if for 
no other reason than the extremely sturdy activities of China, 
European Union, and other parties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    So in terms of the overall objective, we need to solve the 
financing issue, but I am not privy to any decision that the 
President has made regarding any other nominees for the Ex-Im 
Bank board. I do sit on it as an ex officio member, but that is 
the only real relationship that I have at this moment with the 
Ex-Im Bank.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Coming from the most trade-dependent state in
the country, we would sure like to see that to be fully 
operational.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    Secretary Ross. I understand that, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Finally, Commerce Department decisions on
exclusions from impending steel and aluminum tariffs will be 
made on a company-by-company basis rather than by product, and 
granting an exclusion from tariffs to one company means that 
that company gains a potentially huge economic advantage over 
its competitors. Given that, it is important that the process 
be impartial and fair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;So how will the Commerce Department make sure that 
companies with political and business connections to President 
Trump are not favored in that process, and will the process be 
open and transparent?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, the process will be open and 
transparent. We have posted a notice in the Federal Register 
and on our website earlier this week and accompanied that with 
a press release. We have shortened the time period, we are not 
requiring big, long, protracted things, because we want to 
minimize the amount of inconvenience that any of the affected 
parties will suffer as a result of the process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    So we are gearing up to be fast, to be fair, and to be 
practical.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;It looks like my time is up.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Kilmer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    I am pleased to recognize at this time the former chairman 
of the full committee, the gentleman from Kentucky.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for
recognizing me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Secretary, welcome. We are glad to have you here again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;As you helped lead the Administration's efforts to boost 
the American economy, particularly in trade and particularly in 
juxtaposition from China, as you lead those efforts, we cannot 
afford to leave behind Americans in certain sections of the 
country like mine. So I want to ask you about the Economic 
Development Administration, which you have proposed to zero out 
for the second straight year. We disregarded your 
recommendations last year and I have hopes that we will do the 
same for the coming year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;As you explicitly note in your budget proposal, ``The EDA 
has led the Federal economic development agenda for over 50 
years by promoting innovation and competitiveness, preparing 
American regions for growth and success in the worldwide 
economy,'' end of quote. I entirely agree with you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Further, your own evaluations show EDA programs have 
exceeded performance goals in private sector investment in 
distressed communities and jobs created as a result of EDA 
grants. Yet, for the second year in a row, you propose to 
eliminate the agency entirely.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Now, here is a knowable known, a knowable known. My 
district is among the poorest, most economically distressed 
congressional districts in the country. In more than half of my 
30 counties, more than half, at least 30 percent of residents 
live below the poverty level. Even the county with the lowest 
percentage is still well above the national average. This dire 
need is exactly why over the years, these 50 years, this EDA 
administration has been so helpful to us in recruiting jobs to 
keep our people at home and to prevent starvation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Mr. Secretary, I am very concerned about this proposal, how 
it would affect rural America, and I would like to hear your 
answer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Secretary Ross. Thank you for that question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;The Administration's 2019 budget prioritizes rebuilding the 
military and making critical investments in the nation's 
security. It also identifies the savings and efficiencies 
needed to keep the Nation on a responsible fiscal path. The 
Administration has made the necessary tradeoffs and choices, 
difficult choices inherent in pursuing these goals. This means 
changing the role and size of the Federal Government and 
prioritizing the programs that provide a good return for the 
taxpayer, as well as those that serve the most critical 
functions, while consolidating or eliminating duplicative, 
ineffective, or less critical programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Many difficult decisions were necessary to reach the 
funding level provided in this budget and, unfortunately, the 
elimination of EDA is one of those.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Well, within EDA, I am particularly troubled
about the loss of money we have historically directed to assist 
coal-mining communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Now, I come from the war field, the war on coal. I have 
12,000 laid-off coal miners in my district alone, who are able 
people, mechanically talented people, who are now trying to 
find a job at McDonald's, unsuccessfully, I might add. In the 
past, EDA has worked to help these types of communities that 
need some assistance from somewhere. The only place to turn to, 
frankly, Mr. Secretary, is EDA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;I would hope that you could reconsider your budgetary 
recommendation in this regard.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Secretary Ross. Yes, sir. I am sure you are aware, 
Congressman, that the President has tried very hard to end the 
war on coal, has tried very hard to make a more level playing 
field for the coal operators, and has developed a whole 
Appalachian strategy, which he is trying to implement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    We also, as part of the negotiations with China, when we 
were over there in November, got agreement in principle on a 
huge project in the state that we think will answer to some 
degree the question of putting people to work. We are not 
running away from that objective, it is just this particular 
means of trying to achieve it doesn't seem to fit within the 
budget. And I am sorry to say that, because I like the EDA.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Well, so do I, as you may have suspected. But,
yes, the war on coal was real, and this President promised to 
end that war and I think he has, but in the meantime we have 
got a lot of wounded soldiers on the battlefield who are 
desperately in need of some help from this President who 
promised to help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;So, again, I would hope you would reconsider your decision 
to cut this agency, which you personally like, and so do I.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, thank you, Congressman. We will give 
careful thought to that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Rogers. And of course the
budget is simply a recommendation, which we appreciate very 
much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    And I am pleased to recognize the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania, Mr. Cartwright.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Mr. Secretary, I want to follow up on Chairman Rogers' line 
of questioning. It seemed to me, and I might be incorrect about 
this, but when he asked you about, you know, why are you 
cutting EDA, Chairman Rogers was very eloquent in explaining 
the importance of EDA to depressed areas, areas that include my 
district as well, a former coal-mining region, and it occurred 
to me that you were reading the response, Mr. Secretary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;You were talking about, I think you said, unsuccessful and 
duplicative programs in the Federal Government. You don't mean 
to say EDA was unsuccessful or duplicative, do you?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, we do have the Small Business 
Administration, which helps local companies. We have proposed a 
very big infrastructure project or series of projects, a lot of 
which hopefully will help those areas that need capital 
investment, rural areas that need broadband and infrastructure 
needs that will facilitate economic development.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    So the Administration is not running away from the idea of 
helping. What it is doing is trying to have a reasonable 
overall budget, and that means we have to make very difficult 
choices, very uncomfortable choices, one of which is the EDA.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Mr. Secretary, since taking office in 2013,
I have seen firsthand how the EDA has provided opportunities 
for communities in my district. Despite this great work in my 
district and Chairman Rogers' district and across the country, 
what you call your laser focus on investing in our economy, 
despite all of that, the Administration, again, for the second 
year in a row, proposes to eliminate the EDA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Now, I am the lead Democrat on a bill that Chairman Rogers 
introduced called the RECLAIM Act, and Senator McConnell also 
in the Senate introduced that. That would inject $1 billion to 
benefit communities that have been significantly impacted by 
the declining use of coal. Even without the RECLAIM Act, the 
past Appropriations bills have directed $90 million per year 
administered by the EDA to help the exact types of communities 
this Administration has repeatedly claimed to want to help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;So are you really suggesting that the Small Business 
Administration and this infrastructure program where 80 percent 
of the money has to come from local and state governments, are 
you really suggesting that those will effectively supplant the 
great work that EDA does in these depressed areas?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, the best way to help all communities 
is to have a stronger overall economy, that is the number one 
priority of the President. I believe he is delivering very, 
very well on that promise. There is economic growth in the last 
several quarters that economists previously had said were not 
achievable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    We are trying very hard to balance the needs of the economy 
and, as I mentioned, unfortunately, difficult choices have to 
be made and the decision on EDA was one of those difficult 
choices. We just cannot afford everything that we would like to 
do had we had the money.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Just I want to make sure I understand you
perfectly clearly, Mr. Secretary. You have used the word 
duplicative. Over the past 18 years, the EDA has provided $18.5 
million in funding to my area, Northeastern Pennsylvania, with 
a 50-percent match by state or local governments. Can you 
provide a specific example of private sector resource that 
would be available should state and local governments be unable 
to cover the loss of Federal support with their own cash-
strapped budgets?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Secretary Ross. All right. Well, as you know, Congressman, 
for the first time in many, many years, a new coal mine 
actually opened in Pennsylvania and we helped them negotiate 
shipping coal overseas. So that has nothing to do with EDA, 
that was done elsewhere in the Commerce Department.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;EDA is not the only way that we try to help communities. We 
have Foreign Commercial Service people in many, many, many 
communities around the country trying to help businesses 
develop export activity. One of the great tragedies of our 
current situation is that fewer than three percent of all 
American businesses ever export anything. We are trying very, 
very hard to change that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;In addition, we have Select USA, which is the largest 
foreign direct investment program that we have. We had 3,000 
participants last year here in Washington in the middle of 
June. The State of West Virginia and the State of Washington, 
if memory serves, were both very well represented with their 
economic development people, and I believe that some actual 
investments by foreigners in those States came as a result of 
it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    So there are many other ways that we are trying to help the 
communities and it is unfortunate that we have to cut out this 
particular one, but we are in a financially stringent period.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Well, finally, Mr. Secretary, I represent a
district that has communities that do continue to struggle, but 
with the help of EDA's Regional Strategies Program, for 
example, Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Pennsylvania will 
invest in over 15 startups and manufacturers that will create 
200 new jobs with a median salary of $72,000. These startups 
and manufacturers often struggle early on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Now, Secretary Ross, in September of 2017 you stated, ``RIS 
projects will enable entrepreneurs in communities across the 
U.S. to start new businesses, manufacture innovative products, 
and export them throughout the world, increasing America's 
global competitiveness,'' unquote. Today, despite this glowing 
review showcasing exactly why this program is a wonderful 
investment of our taxpayer dollars, you are proposing the 
elimination of that program, a part of EDA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;And I just want to end by echoing Chairman Rogers and I am 
not sure you answered his question. Will you reconsider 
elimination of EDA?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, we have submitted the budget proposal 
that is before you and we will seriously consider everything 
that we hear and learn today, but it would be inappropriate for 
me to commit to you that there will be any change in our 
proposal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    Our proposal is what it is, we feel it is what is 
necessary, and I am afraid that is where we are at this point.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Cartwright.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    I will recognize the gentleman from West Virginia, Mr. 
Jenkins.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;I would like to associate myself with the comments from the 
gentleman from Kentucky. And I think you have heard from a 
bipartisan group that we are all supportive of the EDA. I am 
from coal country, I am from West Virginia, and I appreciate 
you coming to West Virginia recently. So I join with my 
colleagues, I am a staunch defender and supporter of the EDA, 
and will fight tooth and nail to make sure that that program 
gets funded.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Mr. Secretary, you referenced coal exports in your 
comments. You have also referenced deals to try to improve coal 
exports. What I hear oftentimes is the issue of many States 
prohibiting the export of coal out of ports in their States and 
trying to drive an ideological, anti-coal agenda.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;What can you and your department do to make sure that we 
have free-flowing commerce, that we get our incredible natural 
resource like coal through our ports to get on this trade 
deficit that you are so focused on? We have got to get our 
resources moving, we have got to get them through our ports, we 
cannot allow local governments to try to drive an ideological 
agenda.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, if you would let me know or let my 
staff know which are the ports and which are the States, we 
will see what----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Washington. I could run through the list. I
think we know what they are. I mean, these are all well 
recognized and acknowledged local governmental and State-driven 
initiatives to put up barriers on the ability to export coal 
out of ports in their States. Washington.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Right. I don't know that the Commerce 
Department has jurisdiction over those actions. As a layperson, 
it strikes me that it is more likely that would take some sort 
of congressional action to deal with that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Well, we would like to work with you to try to
explore options, because I think there are ways that we can, 
defining certain things as interstate commerce and all, where 
we can prohibit states from taking these types of action.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;So I would like to work with you, Mr. Secretary, to try to 
make sure any barriers that we do have the ability to break 
down that we do so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, I am certainly eager to facilitate 
exports in general and exports of coal in particular, and I 
think we have already proven that with some of the other 
actions that we have taken.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Thank you. Secondly and, again, thank you for
the trip to China and referencing West Virginia's 
participation. For the Members of the committee, a memorandum 
of understanding was signed with China suggesting an investment 
of $80 billion in West Virginia's oil and gas industries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;What is your level of confidence, having been there in 
person, having been a part of the negotiating team, is this 
real? Can we count on it? I have met with our Governor, I have 
talked with our Secretary of Commerce in West Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Tell me your opinion about how realistic and reliable these 
announcements are for creating economic activity in our state.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, I met with your Governor when he was 
up here in Washington recently for the Governors Conference and 
at that point he indicated it was his understanding that things 
were progressing in a reasonably satisfactory fashion. I have 
certainly not heard anything from the Chinese side to the 
contrary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;    So as far as I know, it is early days, this is an enormous 
project, enormously complicated, enormously large in scope, and 
consequently it is not something that will happen Monday 
morning. But as far as I can tell from the inputs we have been 
receiving, the early stages look favorable.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;I would like to make sure our congressional
office is working with your office, and I appreciate that you 
are getting updates from the Governor on how it is going, we 
would like to be supportive of your staff's engagement. There 
is obviously a very important role from DOC under your 
supervision to be a key player in this very complicated, as you 
described, business opportunity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;So I think it is going to take all of us working together. 
We want one plus one to equal three. And so I just encourage 
the continued engagement. I appreciate your support and let's 
all work together, whether it be this project or others. We 
have got great economic needs and we have great opportunity to 
invest in West Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, Mike Platt in our office, the Office 
of Legislative Affairs, would be a very good working 
relationship with your staff. So I would urge you to have your 
staff reach out to Mike and we will do our best to keep them 
abreast.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;We look forward to working with you. Thank
you, Mr. Secretary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Thank you, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt; Ms. Meng.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Secretary for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;What is the purpose of the census as required by the 
Constitution?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. I'm sorry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;What is the purpose of the census as required by
the Constitution?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. The Constitution requires us to enumerate 
every person at the place of their normal residence.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;And do non-citizens count as every person?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Non-citizens do count as a person.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;And do you believe non-citizens count equally as
citizens for the purpose of the census?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. That is a more complicated question 
because, as you know, early on in the census certain parties 
were counted as a fraction of a person. So we have no intention 
in the 2020 census of counting anyone except as a person.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Thank you. And will adding the question of
citizenship help improve accuracy for the census?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, that is one of the questions with 
which we are grappling and one of the important issues that 
will inform our ultimate decision. We will make a decision by 
March 31st, which is the date on which we must inform the 
Congress of the final questions for the 2020 census.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Well, if it helps, and I am sure you do know
this, that four former directors of the census who have served 
in both Republican and Democratic administrations have all 
written that they are concerned in asking about citizenship 
status, that it would exacerbate privacy concerns and lead to 
inaccurate responses, and that the sum effect would be bad 
census data.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. We are very aware of the views of those 
four directors and also of the views of other former census 
directors.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;And what are the costs associated with adding a
last-minute question like the citizenship question?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, the cost question is one of the ones 
that we would obviously be grappling with. The actual cost of 
the incremental printing and all that is pretty trivial, so 
that is not the big issue. The question is response rate and 
the follow-up activity that is needed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;The in-language testing and marketing and
research that you previously mentioned today, has it been 
tested on a question such as the citizenship question?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. The citizenship question has been used 
repeatedly in the American community survey.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;In the 2020 census operation plan, it states that
if the final English content changes after April 2018, then 
there will not be adequate time in the schedule to translate, 
design, and produce non-English questionnaires for the 2020 
census.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, that is correct. That is why we will 
be certain to make the decision one way or the other by March 
31st.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;And going back to Mr. Serrano's question about
potential politicizing of this question and input on the 
census, you mentioned that you had not seen the email that the 
Trump campaign sent out, so I just wanted to show you a copy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;And if I could submit it for the record, Mr. Chairman?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. My eyesight is not good enough to read it 
from over here.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Neither is mine, but I have extra copies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Has the President or anyone in the White House discussed 
with you or anyone on your team about adding this citizenship 
question?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. I am not aware of any such.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Many advocates have noted that the inclusion of a
question around citizenship will greatly decrease immigrant 
community participation in the census, which goes against its 
purpose. Have you considered this impact of including the 
citizenship question and what is your assessment of the impact 
and what will you do to ameliorate this problem?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well response rate is one of the central 
issues, especially as it relates to cost and potentially as it 
relates to accuracy. So that is one of the very many factors 
that we have been considering actively. I mentioned before, I 
think perhaps when you were not in the room, some of the other 
measures that we're taking to make the census more accessible 
to people. So if I may, I'd like to briefly summarize those 
steps that we are taking. We're do----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;If I could, I--actually, Mr. Secretary, I was in
the room, I did hear.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Oh, you were.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;And I do appreciate your efforts. I am just
concerned about how those measures will affect the minute 
addition of a question. My time is running out, but I do hope 
sincerely, Mr. Secretary, that you will take away what you have 
heard from today's meeting. The mission of a census is to 
serve, as on your website, states that it is to serve as the 
leading source of quality of data. So I implore you in the 
interest of the taxpaying American people that you do what you 
can and in your power to make this process as less expensive 
and as much accurate as possible. Thank you. I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. I stand by what we said on the website.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt; Judge Carter.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Ross,
welcome. We are really honored to have you here today. You have 
consistently stated that unfair trade practices put our 
businesses at disadvantage in the global markets. The President 
has made it clear that free and fair trade is critical to the 
economy and the strategic position of the United States. And I 
don't need to tell you how important trade is to the great 
State of Texas. It is clear that trade enforcement and 
compliance are a focus for you in the budget.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;What changes are you making within the International Trade 
Administration to put the nation on a level playing field? Back 
home in Texas we have a large computer technology presence with 
many highly skilled computer experts. What steps are you taking 
to level the playing field in regards to intellectual property 
rights?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, as I am sure you are aware, 
intellectual property rights, Congressman, are the topic of a 
section 301 investigation, which should be coming to a 
conclusion in the fairly immediate future. And depending on 
what the study recommends and depending on what the President 
does with it, that will be a direct response to the problem of 
intellectual property rights.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Meanwhile, the new Patent Director, Mr. Iancu, is also 
taking steps to improve the durability and the quality of 
patent protection that we give. And on that score it is 
interesting to note an amazing statistic: around about June of 
this year, the U.S. Patent Office will issue its ten millionth 
patent. That is a pretty extraordinary achievement. And it is 
symbolic of how important intellectual property rights are to 
our everyday citizen and to every business in this country.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Our founding fathers clearly recognized that
our ideas had worth. And I think this is very important to the 
future of the United States of America. Let me stress, and I 
can't stress more that NAFTA is very important to the State of 
Texas and to our farmers. Completely withdrawing from NAFTA 
could spell disaster for the wheat and corn farmers. In large 
part that trade is conducted through NAFTA. NAFTA has been 
great for U.S. farmers and for our ranchers helping U.S. 
agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico to increase 350 
percent since 1993. One out of every seven Texas jobs is 
connected to agriculture. However, the NAFTA negotiations 
progressing and will this trade budget suffice on those 
negotiations? Dairy farmers are important to Texas. Can you 
elaborate on what measures you are considering with concern to 
Canada in allowing dairy farmers to access Canadian markets?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, I made no secret that I am very 
opposed to the dairy management system that the Canadians use. 
I think it is a terrible system. It has been very, very 
detrimental to the milk industry and the dairy industry in 
general in the United States. It is one of many problems that 
we have in terms of the relationship with Canada.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;But in terms over the overall question, a withdrawal from 
NAFTA, the President has said his first choice is not to 
withdraw. His first choice is to get a better deal in 
agriculture and in manufactured goods and in services, both 
financial services, digital services and other kinds of 
services. So it is not anyone's favored alternative. But unless 
you are at the end of the day known to be prepared to take an 
extreme measure if the deal is lousy you won't win.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    So it is very important that people understand that status 
quo is not acceptable. That there are problems that have come 
in. And I think the good news is that there have now been these 
seven sessions done some in Mexico, some in Washington, some in 
Canada, and there has been progress made on a lot of what I 
would call the easier issues. And those are all going to bring 
some sort of benefit to the U.S. The harder issues are the ones 
that are being grappled with now. But I don't believe that the 
President would have granted a temporary absolution from the 
232 tariffs on steel and the 232 tariffs on aluminum if he 
didn't think there was a reasonable chance that we could not 
only resolve the national security aspects of those, but also 
come to fruition in an overall economic sense with Canada and 
Mexico. He may be wrong, but it certainly represents a good 
faith effort to do it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; I agree. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Thank you. Mr. Secretary, consistent with your
demands for time, we are hopeful that we can have at least an 
abbreviated second round of questions. Is that agreeable with 
the Secretary?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Yes. I believe it has been scheduled for as 
long as 11:30 if need be. I am happy to do a second round.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;11:30?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;All right. We will meet your request.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Now, perhaps I shouldn't have volunteered 
that time. That may be an unpolitical move on my part.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;I was thinking just 5 minutes, but I am glad
you are giving us another forty minutes. Mr. Secretary, it has 
been mentioned here before about steel. Several steel companies 
have had to close their plants and lay off employees at an 
alarming rate due to unfair trade practices from their foreign 
competitors. Several of these companies joined together and 
filed a complaint with the International Trade Administration 
and the International Trade Commission accusing China and other 
countries of purposefully undervaluing their corrosion 
resistant steel imports in order to increase their market share 
in the U.S.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;However, there is a significant backlog of anti-dumping 
cases pending before the International Trade Administration, 
which is having a negative impact on the domestic steel 
industry. Over the last few years this Committee has steadily 
provided funding increases for the International Trade 
Administration's enforcement and compliance division. I am 
pleased to see that the President's request continues this 
trend with some money above the House passed bill in fiscal 
2018. How do you plan to use these resources, these increased 
fundings to prevent such large case backlogs in the future?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, the ITA has been--and Commerce in the 
aggregate has been much more active than in any prior 
administration. We have been running seventy, eighty percent 
more cases initiated than had been true in the prior 
administration. We have also completed far more cases than any 
administration ever has completed. We had over a hundred cases.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;In terms of total trade orders outstanding, we have some 
424 in existence and in force right now, about half of which 
relate to various steel products. We have 87 or thereabouts 
pending cases at the moment, of which 38 also relate to steel 
and steel products. So I can assure you that is one of the 
materials that is very much on our mind.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;The problem with a trade case under the World Trade 
Organization rules is it gets to be a little bit of a game of 
whac-a-mole. What happens is we are required to file in the 
case very precise product specifications. Sometimes to the 
extent of saying ``two-tenths of a millimeter in depth is the 
product.'' And we also have to be very specific as to the 
geography. So what that results in is the offending dumper will 
then move it to another country and it will suddenly come in as 
though it were manufactured in that other country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    We had it recently with oil country tubular goods. A lot 
was starting to come in, steel products, that was starting to 
come in from a country that doesn't even have an oil and gas 
industry at all. So the only reason that they got into the 
business was to take dumped hot rolled coil, fabricate it into 
oil country tubular goods and then dump it in the U.S. And that 
kind of problem of direct transshipment and sometimes 
transshipment after additional manufacture is one of the 
factors that motivated us to do the 232 proceeding. Because the 
232 proceeding, unlike a normal trade case, can cover the 
entire world. It doesn't have to be a product. It doesn't have 
to be limited to a country. So that was one of the motivations 
in order to try to protect the national security interest in 
steel and aluminum.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Well, back onto the International Trade
Administration. We have increased funding over the years lately 
for the Administration. And yet the caseload at ITA still is 
high.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, it is high, sir, because we are 
initiating more actions. It isn't that they are being 
negligent. It isn't that they are not pursuing the cases. When 
we initiate more actions naturally the caseload will go up. 
There is no backlog because there are all sorts of statutory 
dates of a case. I am not aware of any significant number of 
cases where we have failed to adhere to the statutory deadlines 
unless requested to do so by the petitioners. Our general 
practice has been if the American petitioner requests more time 
to prosecute the case we generally will grant it. If the 
adverse party, the foreign dumper or alleged dumper, requests 
time we normally do not grant it. But we do grant it if the 
American party does not object.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    So if there are individual cases that you feel or any of 
your constituents feel have not met the statutory deadlines or 
have otherwise been unnecessarily delayed, I would be very 
eager to hear about them. And I promise you I will deal with 
them promptly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;I appreciate that. I will offer one to you. AK
Steel in Ashland, Kentucky----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Secretary Ross. Yes, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Mr. Rogers [continuing]. Is a part of the group that filed 
a complaint with ITA and ITC at Commerce.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;That is one where we have 700 employees laid
off.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Yeah, I am familiar with AK Steel. And we 
have been in touch quite recently. If I am not mistaken they 
participated in the group of CEOs that came to the White House 
a few weeks ago. As it happens on the very day that the 
President announced what his decision was going to be on the 
232s. So we are actively in touch with AK. I am quite familiar 
with their problems, both in their Kentucky operation and with 
the electrical steel situation elsewhere in their system. And I 
think you will find that they are very happy with the 232 
measures that we have put in.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;They are indeed. What affect on these pending
cases will the President's 232 proposal, if put in place, how 
will that affect these pending cases?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Oh, they will go forward. The concept of 
the 232 is that those tariffs are in addition to any normal 
trade case that we bring. Ones before this and ones subsequent 
to it. Now, if we have designed the 232s right, there should be 
somewhat fewer cases in the future because it covers such a 
wide range of products. Between the two cases I think it is 
some 700 odd products that are covered. So our hope is that 
this kind of omnibus thing will reduce somewhat the flow of 
cases. But it is always possible that the serial dumpers will 
decide to eat the tariffs and find some other way to get around 
them. And therefore we'll be at least as diligent going forward 
on dealing with individual infractions as we have been 
heretofore.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;Well, Mr. Secretary, if this 232 action is
successful I would like to visit with you and we'll sample a 
taste of bourbon together. How does that sound?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Secretary Ross. I am sorry, I didn't hear. Someone coughed 
and I don't know if that was a nervous reaction to your 
comments or what, but it drowned it out so I couldn't hear it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;I said if it is successful we'll toast each
other with a glass of bourbon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt;    Secretary Ross. All right. The bourbon may be readily 
available if the EU falls through.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Rogers"&gt; Ms. Lowey.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;Welcome, Mr. Secretary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Congresswoman Lowey, good to see you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;Good to see you. We usually see each other in
July.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;And I hope to see you same place, same time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;Nice to see you. And I would love to take you to
my district. The question that I am going to ask relates to the 
Lamont-Doherty program, which is superb. It is in Rockland 
County.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. I am sorry, I couldn't hear.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;I was just saying that I would like to take you
to the Rockland County part of my district. It used to be all 
Westchester. Now I have both. And there is a program called 
Lamont-Doherty, which is really an important service to the 
community. And I would like to--I will even take you to lunch. 
We could have a visit there one of these days. So----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, given the sensitive attitude about 
men and women interacting we have to be very cautious to have 
the lunch be well attended.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;And I won't offer you bourbon, you could be sure
of that. I would rather have an ice cream soda, but OK. Mr. 
Secretary, for the second straight year, the Trump 
administration is proposing to eliminate the National Sea Grant 
Program. This national network of colleges and universities 
conducts vital scientific research in support of the 
conservation and practical use of the coasts, Great Lakes, and 
other marine areas. In addition, according to information 
provided by the Sea Grant network and reported by NOAA, in 2016 
alone, the Federal investment in Sea Grant helped produce more 
than $600 million in economic benefit, with more than 7,000 
jobs created or sustained and 1.4 million acres of habitat 
restored or protected, to name just a few of the program's 
impacts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;Given these statistics, isn't there a credible and 
persuasive case for continuing the federal investment in the 
National Sea Grant program? Which refers to my invitation 
before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;That this is such a valuable program. And I have
met with those who run the program, I have talked to students 
that have produced real economic benefit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. The Sea Grant Program is a successful 
program, we certainly agree with that. But providing grants to 
states is a lower priority than the core NOAA functions. And 
therefore things like surveys, charting, weather forecasting 
and fisheries management, in our view, unfortunately the monies 
needed for those overwhelm the monies that we would have had to 
put into the Sea Grant program. In budget stringency periods 
you simply have to make difficult choices. And this was one of 
the very difficult choices we made.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;Well, I do hope if I can encourage you to come
visit the program, that you may understand how important it is 
and how essential the benefits are, and maybe we can change 
your mind. I think it would be a worthwhile trip. And we will 
follow up. You don't have to respond right now, but I hope 
you----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Thank you for the invitation, 
Congresswoman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;OK. The Commerce Department's new strategic plan
makes special mention of the need to reduce extreme weather 
impacts. Yet once again the Trump administration is proposing 
to eliminate funding for the Regional Coastal Resilience Grant 
program, which provides competitively awarded funding to enable 
coastal communities to withstand extreme weather and related 
hazards. In announcing the most recent grants provided under 
this program, Dr. Russell Callender, the Assistant NOAA 
Administrator for the National Ocean Service, stated, and I 
quote, ``From restoring estuaries that provide natural 
shoreline protection to reducing coastal flooding impacts, the 
projects supported by these grants assist in ensuring the 
safety and vibrancy of our nation's coastal communities and 
economies. We are pleased to be partnering with local agencies 
and groups on the ground to have the greatest impact.'' Mr. 
Secretary, would you agree with Dr. Callender that the funding 
provided through the Regional Coastal Resilience Grant program 
is of great value?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Once again, we are in the unfortunate 
position, NOAA needs lots of money and the Department needs 
lots of money. But we are in a very budget constrained period. 
And consequently we had to make some very, very uncomfortable 
decisions, including that one.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;Well, frankly we are in the middle of
negotiating the bill, the big omnibus bill, which we hope will 
be completed on Thursday, and there is still items outstanding. 
And it seems to me that it is more money than we have ever had. 
And so it is a matter of choices. And I would hope that we can 
continue the conversation so I can encourage you or persuade 
you to understand the value of these programs. There are some 
that I wouldn't even discuss. But these two programs I think 
are essential, and I would appreciate your consideration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Thank you. And I know you have given it 
very serious thought.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Lowey&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Ms. Lowey"&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt; I will recognize the gentlemen from Texas,
Judge Carter.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary,
concerning your 232 exemptions and your backlog we were just 
previously discussing with Chairman Rogers, we will talk about 
backlogs in a minute. But 232 exemptions that allow countries 
to petition for relief from imposed tariffs, it is been 
reported the Department expects 4,500 applications that could 
result in 24,000 hours of increased workload to process. Does 
this budget proposal take into account that number and that 
number of hours? And how do you intend to address the increased 
workload?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, we have provided for more staffing in 
the 2019 budget request. And we have gotten more staffing in 
earlier periods. We believe that we can handle the influx. The 
4500 was our estimate as to the number of exemption requests 
that we would receive. We have no way to judge whether that is 
correct or incorrect. But as you know we are required to make 
an estimate of those factors. And that was the best judgment we 
could make at the time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Well, having inherited a bench which had a
2,000 case backlog, the only way you can deal with a backlog is 
build a fire under both parties and make them come in for 
resolution. And I worked until ten o'clock at night every night 
for two years to get it done. Maybe your boys can't do that, 
but you can't live with a backlog in a business community, as 
you well know, you are a businessman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Oh, no. And that is why we waived a lot of 
the normal trade procedures about hearings and response dates 
and all that. Also, as I am sure you are well aware, we took 
enormous amounts of testimony, oral and written, and had 
enormous amounts of meetings with parties prior to issuing the 
232. So we don't come to this process with a blank canvas.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Well, I know you are famous for being very
efficient. And I know you are well aware that the business 
community gets very nervous when they see backlog, potential 
backlogs that could keep them from having access.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;And I encourage you, as you sound like you are
going to do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, that is what we do. That is what we 
do, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you, Judge Carter. Mr. Secretary, I
would like to ask you about the disaster relief supplemental. 
EDA is--you have heard from our other members of the committee, 
is an important agency that has a lot of vital and important 
functions. One of which is to provide grants where they can do 
the most good for people recovering from disasters through the 
emergency supplemental bill that the Congress passed. We 
provided $600 million for EDA for areas that had multiple major 
disaster declarations. And that certainly includes Houston. The 
way that was written we want to make sure Houston and Texas are 
at the top of the list. And that money can be used for, not 
only for economic development, but for mitigation of flood 
damage to help repair damage to existing flood structures and 
to mitigate or enhance flood control structures to promote 
economic growth. That money was specifically appropriated for 
that purpose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;And one of the reasons I had to step out for a moment is 
Secretary Carson is next-door on my other subcommittee on THUD 
and he is a capable good man, as are you. But these agencies 
move so slowly. One of our greatest sources of frustration as 
members of Congress is when we have an emergency like this when 
Puerto Rico got hammered by the hurricane, and we urgently need 
this money to reach our constituents to help them recover and 
rebuild. HUD has a reputation of moving like frozen molasses. 
That is just not acceptable. Judge Carter is right, we are 
going to light a fire under whoever we need to light a fire 
under to get help to our constituents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;I know, Joe, you have got family, friends in Puerto Rico 
that have suffered as a result of that terrible storm. The EDA, 
the $600 million that we provided EDA needs to get out the 
door, sir. Could you tell us the status, what progress have you 
made in getting those EDA grants out the door to where they can 
do the most good to help these communities that have suffered 
so much from these terrible hurricanes?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross. I think we are acutely aware of the 
immediate need for solutions to the distribution of the money. 
And we have been working quite actively and aggressively with 
state and local authorities to make sure that we go about it in 
a proper fashion. We understand that sooner is infinitely 
better than later because people are very much in a crisis 
condition. So I assure you we are doing our level best not to 
be a source of delay in Houston or in Florida or Puerto Rico--
--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross [continuing]. Or Virgin Islands or anywhere 
else.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you. While ensuring that our money is
spent efficiently, again, we share the same goal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;We don't want to just shove the money out
the door. We want to make sure it is spent efficiently and it 
is actually reaching the people who are hurt. And in particular 
this funding I was heavily involved, of course, in drafting 
this part to make sure that it----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Secretary Ross. Oh, I am well aware.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Mr. Culberson [continuing]. Goes to help repair damaged 
flood control infrastructure and to enhance existing flood 
control infrastructure where it will have the greatest economic 
benefit. And I point out I had in mind as I was drafting West 
Houston is to the oil and gas----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Secretary Ross. Right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Mr. Culberson [continuing]. Industry what Silicon Valley is 
to the computer industry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Sure.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;British Petroleum's North American
headquarters were completely flooded out.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;And they still are not back in their
offices. We have had major damage to a lot of the oil and gas 
service companies, oil and gas exploration and production 
companies in West Houston. So the economic impact of flood 
mitigation work in West Houston will be profound. And that is 
why I wrote that language that way. So thank you for making 
sure it goes out the door efficiently. But boy do we need it to 
get out in the hands of the Harris County flood control 
district, needs that money as quickly as possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Oh, we know that, Mr. Chairman. We also 
though have to be mindful, we don't want to have some of the 
problems that have accompanied other disaster relief in other 
hurricanes. We are not going to be having trailers sitting idle 
and all sorts of programs----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Exactly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross [continuing]. That occurred elsewhere. So it 
is a balancing act to make sure that we do it fast but 
correctly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Efficiently.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Fast but correctly is our----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross [continuing]. Motto.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;That is why I appreciate you focusing on
local government. The Harris County flood control district has 
a superb reputation of using scarce and precious tax dollars 
wisely and frugally and managing our flood control network very 
well. So appreciate that very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;And I also want to mention that Texas has submitted a 
request, Mr. Secretary, to the Department for a fishery 
disaster declaration in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. Can you 
tell us the status of that request? When can we expect to see 
the outcome of that review?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Many of the disaster requests already have 
been granted. We have a plan to submit the spend plan for the 
remaining 200 non-fishery disaster funding around the 26th of 
this month. NOAA is developing a spend plan overall for how to 
allocate the disaster funds. And we hope to provide it to the 
Congress very, very quickly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Secretary. $400 million of
the money in the emergency supplement was also for NOAA that 
was broken out help repair and replace damaged assets, debris 
removal, mapping, charting, improving weather forecasting and 
200 million for fishery disasters----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Secretary Ross. Right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;Mr. Culberson [continuing]. In 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Now, the weather forecasting I am happy to 
say in this past hurricane season, even though the outcome was 
horrible, we don't control the weather, we just get to forecast 
it. And the statistics show that our forecast were 25 percent 
more accurate this time than in the last big hurricane season. 
So NOAA is performing pretty good work. And I believe the new 
satellite that has been put up just a couple of weeks ago will 
help a lot with that, especially in the western part of the 
U.S. and out into the eastern part of the pacific. Because 
these new sensors will have three times the resolution, four 
times the speed and accuracy. They are much, much improved. We 
therefore think that there can be further improvement, at least 
in giving people earlier and more accurate warnings. Because as 
you know that helps a lot to mitigate damage if people get 
enough warning in advance and it is accurate.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Let me recognize
my good friend from New York, Mr. Serrano.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;My next question was going to be--so I will
simply say ditto. The question that the Chairman asked about 
the monies getting out that were voted on by Congress. And as 
you know I was--I have a special interest in Puerto Rico 
because I was born there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;And we want to see that--there is still a
large percentage or a significant percentage of people without 
lights. There are still roads that need to be cleaned. There 
are different things that need to be done. And in fact, right 
across the hallway they are having a panel on the fact that 
this is six months since Hurricane Maria went through Puerto 
Rico.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;And the situation is still dire in many
places. So if at the minimum I want to tie my sentiments to the 
Chairman in saying that we need to see that money go out. I 
understand your desire not to see money wasted and we support 
you on that. But Congress saw a need, Congress voted an amount. 
And it is not that easy to get money out of Congress for these 
kinds of programs, as the Chairman knows. So anything you could 
do would be helpful. To all the people, but especially those 
folks in Puerto Rico.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Yes. We are devoting a huge amount of time 
and effort to that very project. It is complicated, as you 
know, because there are multiple U.S. Government agencies 
involved. And particularly Army Corp of Engineers in terms of 
the electricity situation. So we are doing our best. We have 
dedicated staff to it and they are reporting to me quite 
frequently as to what they are getting done. It is a horrible 
situation, we have to get it fixed and we have to get it fixed 
quickly. So we are keenly aware of the dire need.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you so much. Appreciate anything you
could do on that. Mr. Secretary, among the President's 
administration's many proposed cuts in NOAA, there is a cut of 
248 funded positions from field offices of the National Weather 
Service as part of a new framework for staffing weather 
forecast offices. The budget submission notes that the 
implementation of this proposal could present some short term 
risks. So my questions, Mr. Secretary, isn't there a real 
possibility that these cuts will create the risk of reduced 
timelines and accuracy in weather forecasting?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. We really don't think so because the 
satellite activity is becoming more and more important. And we 
have had a lot of automation in the offices. The layoffs can 
only occur by agreement with the union, unless we get into a 
RIF, reduction in force, situation. We are trying to avoid that 
by negotiation with the union. But we are not going to layoff 
anybody or leave any positions unfilled if we think there is 
any material risk of reducing the accuracy and timeliness of 
the forecast.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you. I hope so because more than ever
now we need the National Weather Service to be able to function 
as modern as possible, if there is such a phrase.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. I am personally aware of it because my 
normal residence before coming here was a coastal community in 
Florida. So I understand the problem.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;OK. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, both you and
other officials in the Trump administration have spoken of the 
need for strong enforcement of our trade laws. I want to ask 
you about the President's meeting last week with the Canadian 
Prime Minister, as well as the President's statements following 
the meeting. It was reported that in a fund-raising speech last 
Wednesday President Trump boasted that he made up information 
in his meeting with the Canadian Prime Minster, claiming that 
the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada. On Thursday 
morning, President Trump posted on Twitter that the United 
States is running a trade deficit with Canada. In reality the 
U.S. had a trade surplus with Canada of $12.5 billion in 2016. 
So, Mr. Secretary, what does this do to the credibility, in 
your opinion, of the United States in trade negotiations and in 
trade enforcement when the President of our country makes a 
public claim about trade that simply has no basis in fact?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, I was not at the meeting with the 
Canadian Prime Minister, so I am not aware of the context. I 
only knew of it from the newspapers. But I do know that the 
Canadian Government reports to the Canadian public that it has 
a trade surplus with the United States. That is in their 
published records on their website.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;And therefore.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. There is no therefore. I was not part of 
that discussion.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. I have met subsequently with the Trade 
Minister for Canada and I have not noticed any change in the 
relationship that we have with her or with the Government 
overall.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Well, I hope we don't because, you know, more
and more we are finding countries throughout the world that 
disagree with us. And we have a partner like Canada we should 
not get caught up in comments that could hurt that relationship 
in any way when they are not necessary. I mean if something is 
wrong of course you bring it up. So I would hope that you play 
a role behind the scenes there, as I know you are capable of, 
of just saying, you know, some things need to be left alone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Thank you, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Serrano. Mr. Palazzo.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, thank
you for being here today. Over the past decade the worldwide 
consumption of fish and seafood has increased 17 percent. This 
means more seafood is being imported and exported around the 
world from more countries into the U.S. According to the CDC 
study report in February of 2017, 97 percent of fish and 
shellfish consumed in the United States are imported. Last year 
we had a U.S. dollar trade deficit of 4.5 billion from shrimp 
alone. And representing the historic seafood capital of the 
world, Biloxi, Mississippi, could you tell me what is the 
Department doing to help reduce the seafood trade deficit?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, it is one of my pet peeves. I hate 
the idea that with all the water surrounding us and all the 
water inland that we have a trade deficit in fish. And I have 
been putting a lot of pressure on the fisheries management 
group at NOAA to try to deal with the situation. I think there 
is some potential that some of the constraints that we have had 
on fresh catch here maybe need to be relaxed a little bit. I 
think it is easy to be a little bit over zealous and therefore 
hold down the production of fish.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;    Second, I believe there are some inappropriate practices in 
some of the foreign countries in their aquaculture. It seems to 
me that we should be very careful about importing seafood from 
places that do not adhere to the same standards we would have 
for aquaculture here in the U.S. So we are mindful of it both 
from the point of view of seeing what we can do either with 
aquaculture or reevaluation of what are the needs of the fish 
stock so that we--my goal is to have maximum sustainable catch 
be the target for our domestic fishing industry. And as to the 
foreign industries to the degree that they are conducting their 
activities inappropriately we are going to try to constrain 
them as best we can.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Well, thank you. And I appreciate your
agency's work on that subject. Switching gears, being that I 
represent a gulf state and we have been hit really hard by 
natural and manmade disasters in the recent past, these 
disasters have had the negative environmental and economic 
impacts, particularly on commercial and recreational fishing 
industries, their supply chain and their communities. Could you 
tell me, if any, what investment is the Department of Commerce 
making to help industry and these communities recover and be 
more resilient?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Secretary Ross. Well, we have repeatedly declared a fishery 
disaster situation. And I don't remember just all the places 
where we have, but it is quite a few. And there are a couple 
more applications that are pending. So that is one very 
specific step. The best thing we can do though is to try to get 
an early warning system so that people can try to get prepared. 
Because it is not just the fish themselves, it is also the 
vessels that are at issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;    And I don't know if you were in the room when I mentioned, 
but in this past hurricane season our forecasts were 25 percent 
more accurate and they were more timely than they had been 
before. We are trying to increase the advance warning that we 
can give to the affected communities so that they can try to 
prepare themselves. And also trying to be more accurate in the 
location and the severity. So that is one of the major steps 
that we are in a position to take. Then when disasters do hit, 
as you know, Congress has made appropriation and we will try to 
deal with that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Well, thank you for your support and
assistance in that regards. Last question. You know, I come 
from a very rural state where agriculture is our number one 
industry. And as you know overall NAFTA has been good for U.S. 
agriculture. Since implementation agricultural exports to 
Canada and Mexico have totaled approximately 310 billion and 
increased by more than 300 percent from pre-NAFTA levels. The 
administration is wrapping up final talks with our trading 
partners in Mexico and Canada. And the U.S. farm economy is in 
a major downturn right now. And the farmers in my district are 
very worried about our Mexican and Canadian markets going to 
other countries for their ag products. In fact, Mexico 
announced they have already begun discussions with numerous 
countries in South America for corn and other grain products. 
Could you provide the Committee with the latest update from the 
NAFTA negotiations from an agriculture perspective?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Secretary Ross. Surely. We have now had seven rounds of 
negotiation. And a lot of issues, mostly not the most 
contentious ones, but a lot of issues have been negotiated. A 
lot of language has been put to bed. We think there is a 
practical time limit, not a contractual one, not a legislated 
one, but a practical time limit on the negotiations due to the 
political calendar. Mexico, as you know, has a general election 
coming up in the beginning of July. Canada has its provincial 
elections in June. Our fast track authority, the trade 
promotion authority expires on the 8th of July here in the 
States. And, of course, we have the midterm congressional 
elections in the fall.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;    Why all that is important is it is my view that if we don't 
have a resolution within the next month or so very likely it 
will be kicked over for quite a little while because of the 
election cycle. Especially in Mexico where, as you know, there 
is one candidate who is running on a quite anti-American 
platform.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt; Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. Mr.
Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Culberson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Culberson"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Palazzo. Mr. Kilmer.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Thank you, Chairman. The budget proposes to
close the business outreach centers for the Minority Business 
Development Agency and establish the MBDA as a policy office in 
Washington, DC. The City of Tacoma, which I represent, was 
fortunate enough to receive a grant to operate an MBDA business 
center and I got to visit with the folks who were really 
benefitting from the technical expertise and from additional 
resources. That is not unique in the western region. MBDA 
offices have helped businesses access over $200 million in 
loans and equity investments, as well as $800 million in 
procurement contracts. So can you explain how a centralized 
MBDA will serve the needs of minority business owners located 
in communities around the country, many of whom face difficult 
barriers as it is, and can you give us the rationale for 
closing these business centers?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Secretary Ross. Surely. The general concept, well, first of 
all, I have been individually very supportive of the efforts of 
the MBDA. As you know I have addressed minority groups all over 
the countryside and have tried very hard to foster their 
activities. The good news is that minority businesses are 
growing very, very rapidly and are constituting an increasing 
percentage of the new businesses created in the country. And 
they, of course, are very major beneficiaries of the overall 
economic strength and growth that has come on with the Trump 
administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    But in terms of MBDA specifically we intend to refocus it 
as a policy-based and as a leveraging-based entity, rather than 
one making direct grants out in the field. We think that at the 
end of the day that may very well better equip the agency to 
fulfil its mission. Because it is a limited number of 
localities that can get grants in a given year. Whereas, if we 
can change overall policies, we can influence the direction of 
policy more effectively, that might very well have a broader 
impact to the benefit of minority businesses.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;You know, I can understand the value of policy
development here, that is what we do. But I got to tell you, 
you know, seeing the benefits on the ground in communities that 
benefit from this really makes a difference. So I would 
certainly ask that the Department reconsider that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;I similarly was disappointed to see the Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership also under attack for a second year in a 
row. The program's stated goal is to help bring manufacturing 
back to the United States. And in the State of Washington our 
local MEP affiliate, Impact Washington, has done a tremendous 
job. Has really made a difference for manufacturers and has had 
substantial statewide impact. Can you explain how eliminating 
the MEP program that has such local and national impact on job 
retention and growth in manufacturing aligns with the 
President's focus?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Surely. Again, it was a very difficult 
decision. But if you go back to the original concept of the MEP 
it was really meant to be a bridge to elicit local support as 
well. And we have had indications that in many, many localities 
because of the success the obligation to continue it in some 
form at some level of activity will now be subsumed by the 
private sector. And so our hope is that there will be a lot of 
the objectives met in that format. But again, it is one of the 
difficult decisions that we had to make in a time of extreme 
budgetary stringency.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;I would just point out, I think that in both
MBDA and the MEP that decision is sort of divorced from the 
reality on the ground. You know, in Tacoma the ability to 
receive those resources, that technical expertise to 
entrepreneurs is something the MBDA has done very well. And 
Impact Washington, which is the MEP program in Washington 
State, you know, I look at the rural parts of my district where 
you have seen expertise provided on the ground that has led to 
job creation. You know, there is not a whole lot of, you know, 
private capacity to step into that void if the federal 
government backs away. So again, I would just ask that the 
Department reconsider that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Thank you very much for your comment.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt; Thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Kilmer. The Chair recognizes
Mr. Cartwright for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't know that
I will take that. But I want to follow up about trade a little 
bit, Mr. Secretary. I sent the Department of Commerce multiple 
letters supporting using Section 232 of the Trade and Expansion 
Act to help the struggling aluminum and steel industries. I 
also know you were a strong advocate to the President to take 
such action.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;I do have deep concerns about the rollout by the 
administration of tariffs. There are, as you know, certain bad 
actors around the globe who artificially dump and depress steel 
and aluminum prices. Those advocating the use of Section 232 
made very clear that we wanted you to go after the bad actors 
and not our friends and allies. And my concern is the way we 
are going about this is we are going to hurt the 6.5 million 
Americans who work in industries where steel or aluminum is 
used. It could also damage our relationship with close allies, 
lead to a trade war that could severely damage our whole 
economy and undermine the international trading system. And it 
could raise prices for every American for everyday products.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;My question is do you believe that a directed application 
of Section 232 would have been insufficient for our national 
security needs and to protect these industries?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, as I believe you know, the 232 
reports recommended a variety of ways of achieving the same 
objective. The President chose one of those alternatives in the 
case of steel and a similar one in the case of aluminum. The 
reason we are now going through an exclusion process and an 
exemption process is to try to make sure that that broad 
approach does not do undue harm in either category.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Are you personally involved in that
exemption process?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Oh, extremely. Extremely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;And will you do your dead level best to
make sure we don't hurt our friends and allies and the people 
that are playing by the rules?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Right. Well, certainly the people who are 
playing by the rules we will try our best not to hurt. A 
complication is that not everyone who is a defense ally is 
necessarily playing by the fair trade rules.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; Thank you, sir. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Cartwright. The Chair
recognizes Ms. Meng for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I wanted to ask a
question about the traditional census undercount of young 
children. Children, particularly those under the age of 5 are 
at high risk for an undercount during the 2020 decennial 
census. According to data published by the Census Bureau the 
undercount for these children in 2010 was a net 4.6 percent. 
And this undercount interferes with our ability to accurately 
provide needed resources for federal programs, such as TANF, 
special education grants, Head Start and the National School 
Lunch program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;I represent a district in the bureau of Queens, which was 
in the top ten counties in the country for undercount of young 
children. And I wanted to know what are some steps the Census 
Bureau is taking to address this issue?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, it relates to the overall issue of 
how do we encourage count? And you were here when I described 
the additional marketing efforts we are doing, the additional 
community outreach with community partnership. Anything you can 
do to encourage local organizations within your district to 
cooperate with us is probably the best way to do it. Because 
the local people have a different relationship to the 
population in their immediate neighborhood. And therefore I 
would hope that being one of those that apparently had a very 
severe undercount that you will try your best to get people to 
cooperate at the partnership level and even at the individual 
level. We can't require people to cooperate. And it is the--so 
the best we can do is to try to encourage them, try to make it 
easy for them through the multiple languages, through the 
marketing and through voices such as yours that have the 
respect of the community.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Thank you. And my other question is about the
Gateway Project. Mr. Secretary, as someone who was born and 
raised in New Jersey and commuted two hours daily to attend 
school in Manhattan, I wonder what your views and thoughts are 
on the Gateway Tunnel Project that will connect New Jersey and 
New York.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Well, as you know, the Port Authority of 
New York and New Jersey was originally conceived decades ago to 
provide linkages between New York and New Jersey. And as far as 
I know the original project that it was mandated to do never 
occurred. So it is not new, the idea of needing gateway 
projects. The infrastructure bill, assuming that the Congress 
passes it, will provide funding and the funding has an 
allocation formula to it that you are, I think, well aware of. 
We hope that legislation will be passed. And we are sure that 
Gateway will get due consideration, along with other projects.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Thank you. As you know, up to 100,000 people per
day travel between New York and New Jersey. You are right, it 
is not a new issue. Tunnels are corroding. There will be a 
harsh economic impact to America's economy if these workers 
were not able to go to work. This is just one example of how 
important the Gateway Tunnel Project is to New Jersey and to 
New York, but also to America's broader economy. Respectfully I 
encourage you to do everything you can within the 
Administration to ensure that this project is treated fairly 
and that it remains a top priority of our federal government.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Secretary Ross. Thank you for your comments.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Thank you, Ms. Meng. Secretary Ross, thank you
for your time today and thank you for your service to our 
nation. The Committee on Commerce, Justice and Science stands 
adjourned. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Secretary Ross. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Wednesday, April 11, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;    FISCAL YEAR 2019 NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION
REAR ADMIRAL TIM GALLAUDET, PH.D., USN RET.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;All right. Good morning. The hearing will
come to order, and I would like to welcome our witness here 
today, Admiral Gallaudet, the Assistant Secretary, the acting 
Under Secretary of Commerce of Oceans and Atmosphere.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;    Certainly your past experience makes you uniquely suited 
for this job and I appreciate your scientific background and 
your leadership experience that you bring to the agency, and we 
thank you for your service.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Thank you, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;It is good to have you here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;For fiscal year 2019, you are requesting 4.6 billion, which 
is a decrease of more than a billion dollars, or 23 percent, 
from fiscal year 2018. This budget was formulated before we had 
an agreement on adjusting the budget caps and seeks to cut 
almost every program that funds research or NOAA partners in 
academia and the states. And while I agree that we need to 
spend tax payer money wisely, we will carefully review the 
budget proposal to ensure that we are adequately funding 
mission critical expenses at NOAA in 2019.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;    So before we proceed with your statement, I would like to 
recognize the ranking member, the Honorable Mr. Serrano, for 
any remarks that he may have at this time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would also like to
join you in welcoming our guest this morning, Admiral Tim 
Gallaudet, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and 
Atmosphere, and current acting Under Secretary of Commerce for 
Oceans and Atmosphere. I look forward to your testimony before 
our subcommittee as we discuss NOAA's fiscal year 2019 budget, 
and learn more about the vital work our friends are doing as we 
speak.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;I believe that NOAA is one of the most underrated agencies 
under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee. The invaluable 
work and research that NOAA quietly conducts each year has a 
profound impact on our national economy and way of life, yet so 
many Americans do not even realize it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;NOAA's mission is to understand and predict changes to our 
climate, weather, oceans, and coasts. The data and information 
it collects is used by businesses, other federal government 
agencies, and state and local governments to help them make 
informed decisions that affect consumers and the public at 
large.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;NOAA also protects and manages our nation's oceans and 
marine resources that make up a large part of the beautiful 
American landscape.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;For fiscal year 2019, NOAA's requesting just over $4.5 
billion, which represents more than $1.3 billion reduction from 
the fiscal year 2018 level. Coastal Zone Management Grants, 
climate and oceans research, national marine sanctuaries, 
environmental literacy programs, fish catch share, and stock 
replenishment programs, the National Sea Grant program, and 
countless others will see drastic cuts or complete elimination 
if this budget request is adopted.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Even the National Weather Service operating budget will see 
a cut of nearly 8 percent. It is as though the administration 
sees little value in the work conducted by the countless 
scientists and researchers at NOAA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;With the damage and devastation to Puerto Rico, the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and others during 
the 2017 hurricane season, now is not the time to cut NOAA's 
budget by more than a billion dollars. Even NOAA acknowledged 
that the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was record breaking, 
and the devastation it caused was unprecedented.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;If that is true, why are we cutting this agency's budget so 
drastically? This shortsighted approach to saving money would 
only result in potentially catastrophic consequences further 
down the road. I do not say this lightly, but in the long term 
we will be paying an even higher price for these cuts in terms 
of money and lives lost. This makes no sense to me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Our storms, as you know, are getting stronger. Our oceans 
are getting warmer and experiencing more pollution. Our climate 
is changing rapidly, and millions of lives hang in the balance. 
Certainly, Mr. Chairman, I know that the phrase climate change 
upsets a lot of people. So I have just decided to call it 
something is happening.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; Very good. Proceed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Something is happening. Of course, it is
obvious.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;I believe that we should be making stronger investments in 
NOAA so we can get a better understanding of these atmospheric 
changes and address the growing national security and economic 
challenges we face as a result. Therefore, I cannot support 
this administration's budget request for NOAA, as it represents 
a clear abdication of the agency's core mission.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;I am hopeful that my colleagues on this Subcommittee can 
come together and spare this agency and its invaluable work 
once again. We must look at the larger picture here. If we do 
not get serious about the threat of climate change--and work to 
mitigate it through research, data collection, and 
collaboration, we will be putting nearly half of the American 
population, especially those who live along the nation's 
coastline at risk.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you for joining us this morning, Admiral. I look 
forward to hearing your testimony about the great work that our 
scientists and researchers are doing, and know I also look 
forward to working with my colleagues on this Subcommittee to 
draft a CJS Appropriations Bill that we can all be proud of.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    And may I say, Mr. Chairman, very briefly that the first 
round of the last bill had problems. The second round was one 
that we felt very comfortable about. So hopefully we can move 
in that direction as we put together this bill.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; Thank you. You mentioned climate change, and
I think most of us do know there is climate change out there. I 
think we agree to that. So you can say that. It is a----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Wow.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Mr. Aderholt [continuing]. Well, sometimes the cause----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Mr. Aderholt [continuing]. Of it sometimes is the----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;I know.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Mr. Aderholt [continuing]. Thing that is debated. But 
needless to say, climate change is something, I think, that 
most of us can agree on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    But anyway, Admiral Gallaudet, thank you for being here, 
again. As I mentioned earlier, without objection, your written 
testimony will be entered into the record. At this time, I 
would ask you to summarize your statements, and you may 
proceed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Chairman Aderholt and Ranking Member
Serrano, thank you very much for your support of NOAA, and for 
the entire subcommittee I also thank you for your support in 
the recent Omnibus Appropriations Bill and the Hurricane 
Supplemental Appropriations. Your support will ensure NOAA will 
be able to successfully continue its very diverse and critical 
mission.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;It has been a true honor to serve the past several months 
as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and 
Atmosphere and acting NOAA Administrator. I have seen first 
hand how the women and men of NOAA benefit public safety, 
economic growth, and national security.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;I have been fortunate to visit a number of NOAA's 
facilities, including sites in seven states, and to meet 
hundreds of meteorologists, oceanographers, fisheries managers, 
scientists, engineers, lawyers, and devoted professionals that 
make up NOAA's diverse and first rate workforce. I have also 
had many people in your communities talk to me and tell me of 
the great work that NOAA does, and I have been very moved by 
their appreciation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;The past year was an extremely successful one for NOAA. I 
will share with you three examples of many that are--of our 
remarkable achievements.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;First, we responded effectively to a record setting 
hurricane season, which you mentioned, Congressman Serrano, 
where we saw storms that impacted over 25 million people. Our 
efforts saved thousands of lives despite Hurricanes Harvey, 
Irma, and Maria being three of the five most costly hurricanes 
in history. Our track forecast accuracies for the three 
Category IV hurricanes that made landfall in the U.S. were 25 
percent better than the last five-year average, and we are 
continuing to help communities recover today through our 
response efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Second, NOAA had perfect launches of our GOES and JPSS 
satellites in March and November, respectively. Those platforms 
have already proved their worth by supporting emergency 
managers responding to wildfires and severe storms.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Third, NOAA installed a system of precision navigation 
sensors in the port of Long Beach. That allowed a four-foot 
increase in ship draft for the ships entering port there, 
resulting in millions of dollars of extra cargo that each ship 
can carry every day in just that one port.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;NOAA's fiscal year 2019 budget request of just over $4.5 
billion is focused on two priority areas. The first one is 
reducing the impacts of extreme weather and water events by 
implementing the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation 
Act. I will refer to this priority as the Weather and Water 
Priority.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;The second priority is increasing our sustainable economic 
contributions of our fisheries and ocean resources. I will 
refer to this as our Blue Economy Priority.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Under the Weather and Water Priority, this budget invests 
more than $1.1 billion in weather forecasting capabilities, 
including an increase to the advanced weather interactive 
processing system, or AWIPS, which is the cornerstone of our 
field operations at the National Weather Service. This budget 
also invests $878 million in our polar orbiting satellites, and 
$408 million in our geostationary weather satellites that are 
essential for our weather forecasts and warnings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;NOAA's budget increases investment in the Office of Space 
Commerce, and the Commercial Remote Sensing, and Regulatory 
Affairs Office, both that promote growth in the commercial 
space industry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Under the Blue Economy Priority, NOAA's budget ensures its 
oceanographic capability continues by investing $75 million to 
recapitalize our fleet of survey ships. Through a $200 million 
investment in hydrographic surveys, charting, and mapping, 
NOAA's budget promotes the safe and efficient navigation to 
maximize maritime commerce.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;NOAA's budget continues investment in fisheries management, 
and the scientific research that supports it, and this budget 
request also supports domestic seafood production through a 
$9.3 million investment in marine aquiculture. This will 
support job creation and the growth of America's seafood 
industry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    Thank you for the opportunity to present NOAA's fiscal year 
2019 budget request, and I am happy to take any questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;Thank you, Admiral. And it is Chairman
Culberson's policy that we do the five-minute rule, so we will 
each take five minutes to go around to ask questions. And I'll 
start out.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;In the last six months, NOAA has successfully launched two 
flagship satellites, which you mentioned, JPSS-1 and GOES-S. 
First, I congratulate you and your team for a huge 
accomplishment. So we are certainly proud of that, but now that 
GOES-S is successfully launched, we have five GOES satellites 
on orbit, if I am correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;    My understanding is that the program only requires a total 
of three satellites, two operational satellites and one on 
orbit spare. Given the current surplus of GOES satellites, why 
should we continue building GOES satellites at the current 
rate? Is it best to use the taxpayers' dollars to build GOES 
satellites faster than we actually need them?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Thank you for your question, Chairman, and
you're right. This has been a fantastic program, the--our GOES 
and JPSS satellite programs, and I did happen to see the GOES-S 
launch firsthand at Cape Kennedy, and it went off perfectly to 
the second on the planned launch time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Now, we have--you are correct that we have three--a 
requirement for three satellites, two operational in east/west 
positions, and one to spare, on orbit as a--because it is 
really a no-fail mission in these weather satellites.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;We have two extra surplus satellites currently that are all 
beyond their service life, so that we are just--they are just 
basically bonus and we are fortunate to have them flying still. 
They--we did not--they were not engineered to last this long.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    So with that surplus, we are having discussions with the 
Department of Defense because they have a gap in the Indian 
Ocean region and the Western Pacific, and so we--if we--well, 
we continue to operate those extra satellites, we will share 
some of that data with--we are having discussions to 
potentially use one of them for the Department of Defense 
mission.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; So would you be giving it to them, or would
they just have access to that information? How would that be?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Well, we are not resourced to operate for
them in that orbit, but we would probably partner in some way, 
and we are--those--that has been the focus of our discussions 
right now.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; OK. So no decision has been made yet? Are you
all still in discussions on that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; OK. The GOES and JPSS and their predecessors
have provided critical weather and earth observation data for 
decades and remain a primary input for weather models, but 
space is evolving, as we know. Launches are getting cheaper, 
and space is no longer just the domain of governments. What is 
NOAA doing to take advantage of these changes and lower the 
cost of our observing infrastructure?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;We have several efforts underway, Mr.
Chairman. One is that we are studying the potential of using 
commercial satellite data for our weather models, and so we are 
in the second year of a pilot project to study that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    We also are conducting a fairly extensive satellite 
architecture study, and in that study we are assessing the 
potential for future commercial capabilities and integrating 
those within our current satellite programs using either 
commercial data or even different satellite designs like 
NanoSats and CubeSats.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; I understand that the commercial weather data
pilot program has gotten off----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    Mr. Aderholt [continuing]. To a slower start than was first 
expected; is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; I don't think we had a--it was--it is a
modest endeavor. We don't have a large amount of funds 
dedicated to it, and it was primarily a kind of crawl, walk, 
run effort where we envisioned just looking at one type of 
data, radio occultation, and then in the future, should we 
receive more appropriations funding to conduct studies like 
this, we would look at other types of data.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; Oh, and what would be your next steps for the
pilot program?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; We are--we have done the radio occultation
study. We are going to examine that a little more as new 
commercial sources become available. And the idea would be in 
the future we would look at other data types. It could be 
anything from sea surface temperature to atmospheric 
measurements.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; From what you observe from the pilot program,
what are some of the things that stood out as far as things you 
have learned from that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Well, one of the things we have learned is
the industry isn't evolving as fast as we thought it would. In 
fact, the radio occultation systems that are available 
commercially are very few in number. I think there is only one 
company currently that has the potential to provide it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    So it is--but then again Secretary Ross, my boss in the 
Department of Commerce, he has been involved in a pretty active 
campaign to promote the development of commercial space 
capabilities, and so we anticipate growth in that area.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; OK. Thanks very much. Mr. Serrano.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt;    Admiral, the hurricanes last year caused significant damage 
to NOAA facilities and equipment in the south and southeast of 
the United States, as well as Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. The recently enacted bill provides funding for repairs 
or replacement of those facilities and equipment. Can you give 
us an update as to how that is going?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Sure, and I want to thank you very much,
Congressman Serrano and this entire subcommittee, for 
appropriating that disaster supplemental funding. We will put 
that to very good use.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Currently, we have a spend plan for the 200 million 
allocated for the weather damage and weather research that we 
will use those funds for, and it is currently at the Office of 
Management and Budget under review.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;We intend of that 200 million that 100 million will be 
dedicated to weather research and improved weather forecasting 
and warning, and then we will have another about--the other 100 
million will be used for a number of different things like 
marine debris removal in Puerto Rico and in the southeast 
caused by the hurricanes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    And then there is also another 200 million that will be 
applied to fisheries disasters along the Gulf Coast, and Puerto 
Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and even some West Coast 
fisheries that were disasters--were declared last year.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Now, is that money flowing already or will be
flowing?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Not yet. OMB has to approve it, our spend
plan, and as soon as they do, we will start--and we are lining 
up, you know, our contracts and all the work to be done so we 
can execute it as soon as those funds are available.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    Regarding Puerto Rico, we have much underway already in 
terms of removing marine debris, performing post-storm 
assessments. We worked with the Department of Defense to get a 
weather radar to replace the damaged one that we had--we 
operated there. And I will tell you personally, I have great 
sympathy and appreciation for all the people of Puerto Rico. 
During Hurricane Katrina, my house on the Gulf Coast of 
Mississippi was entirely washed away in 28 feet of storm surge, 
and so I have personal knowledge of what--of the sacrifices and 
loss they have experienced. And so you can be assured, 
personally I will be providing as much support and personal 
involvement I can to ensure we can recover quickly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Thank you. The budget as presented by the
administration cuts 248 funded positions from field offices of 
the National Weather Service, and we know how important the 
National Weather Service is, especially these days. So Admiral, 
won't these further cuts in Weather Service personnel as 
proposed by the President create a very real risk of reduced 
time lines and accuracy in weather forecasting?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Congressman, thank you for your interest in
the Weather Service and support. They are all heroes in my 
opinion. I visited a number of the Weather Forecast offices, 
and they have made great sacrifices during the storm season. I 
have seen in Houston for example, the forecasters were there in 
the office five days straight, sleeping in the office, 
providing warnings to emergency managers, and then that is just 
one of many examples.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;To answer your question, we don't believe that that 
reduction in the number of positions will introduce significant 
risk. In fact, there have been three studies on the work force 
at the Weather Service, and all have concluded that the Weather 
Service can operate more efficiently. There are just a number 
of either operating practices, like reducing the number of 
forecasters on watch, or even the hours any given forecast 
office operates, as well as using automation and improved 
processing technologies like the one I mentioned in my opening 
statement, the AWIPS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    So technology and better business practices at the Weather 
Service, I think, will allow for us to absorb the reductions in 
people in this budget.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Admiral, my last question for this round, the
silliest question you will get all day today, but it is just 
something I came up with last night. So whenever I turn on the 
TV or the radio, wherever I hear the weather forecast, they get 
that from you guys, right? They don't do their own weather 
forecasting?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Actually, TV meteorologists sometimes do
their--often do their own forecast, but they get the baseline 
data and warning information from us, yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; I was wondering if they pay you for that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Our taxpayer dollars pay for us.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; I know.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; The American taxpayers pay for our service,
sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; All right. Thank you, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; Mr. Palazzo.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral
Gallaudet, it is great to see you again. Thank you for being 
here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;During last year's hearing, Secretary Ross made a 
commitment to me and to this Subcommittee to work with the Gulf 
States to find a solution to better manage our red snapper 
fisheries. And Admiral, you and I have spoken about this issue 
as well. Fast forward to today, this administration has stood 
by these commitments, and I want to first say how much I and my 
Gulf colleagues appreciate the willingness of this 
administration to work with our states and the recreational 
fishing community on ways to improve red snapper manager, and 
which, as everyone knows, is by far the most popular and 
contentious off-shore fish in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;I am proud of the work that Mississippi and the other Gulf 
states have put into the developing proposals that will allow 
each of the States to manage recreational fishermen in both 
State and Federal waters over the next two years. Mississippi 
is more than capable of managing its fishery in a way that 
ensures conservation while maximizing access, and I believe it 
should be given the maximum management flexibility possible 
under this proposal.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;    And I know that the question I am about to ask could very 
easily be answered any time this week or next week, so without 
being a spoiler, Admiral, will you commit NOAA fisheries to 
working with Mississippi and the other states to ensure these 
proposals are approved and provide whatever assistance is 
needed to ensure their success?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, Congressman, we will. And I think the
red snapper story this year is a fantastic one, especially in 
light of the last year's season. And so I think we are going to 
be very successful, and I will work with Mississippi and all 
the Gulf states in managing the--in co-managing the red snapper 
fishery.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Thank you for that commitment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;Shifting gears a little bit, as you know from your own 
science background as the--and career as oceanographer of the 
Navy, maintaining the competitive edge in the maritime 
environment is critical for both defense and non-defense. There 
is legislation introduced in both the House and Senate for the 
purpose of developing a NOAA Navy program for the assessment 
and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to the benefit of 
several NOAA offices, including Ocean Exploration and Research.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt;    However, the President's budget has reduced or eliminated 
programs that aim to maintain that competitive edge, especially 
through competitive programs and cooperative institutes with 
university scientists, such as with the University of Southern 
Mississippi, my alma mater, and others. What is your strategy 
for maintaining the United States competitive advantage in the 
area advanced technologies relevant to the NOAA mission, 
especially in unmanned maritime systems and ocean exploration 
with such dramatic reductions to the budget?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;So Congressman, I understand and appreciate
your interest and support of our technology development, 
certainly with respect to ocean capabilities, as well as the 
unmanned systems work we are doing, and we have discussed 
together personally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;And so yes, the budget choices, in terms of the unmanned 
systems work and our office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, 
as well as many others that are important, we may because this 
administration is committed to prioritizing national security 
funding. And in it--from my past experience in the Navy, I 
support that prioritization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;And so we had to cut--we decided to reduce programs that we 
felt were either redundant or had--were primarily supporting 
grants to local stakeholders or States, and it was the core 
government work that we preserved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;With respect to unmanned systems and ocean exploration, we 
didn't zero those out. So even though we removed the unmanned 
systems research effort, there is still a vast amount of great 
unmanned work going on all across NOAA. Our fisheries, for 
example, are doing amazing things serving marine mammals, and 
acoustically with unmanned surface vehicles and underwater 
vehicles looking at fish and fish stocks that--in ways that are 
just much more efficient in cost-savings compared to our 
previous efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    And so we are flying drones. We are doing underwater and 
surface type of activity, and advancing that still in our--in 
the current line of funding we have today, but I will look 
forward to working with you and the Navy going forward to see 
how we can best continue those operations and the research and 
development behind it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palazzo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Mr. Palazzo"&gt; Well, thank you, Admiral. Thank you for your
service. And with that, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; Thanks, Congressman. Ms. Meng.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Thank you, Admiral, for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;I wanted to ask a question about a project that is near my 
district. The National Center for Coastal Ocean Science funds a 
critical research project called Mapping the Long Island Sound 
Floor. The Long Island sound is vital to the region's economy, 
security, and ecology. As you know, the challenge for effective 
coastal planning is balancing the demands of proposed 
development activities, such as telecommunication and cables, 
gas pipelines, and other infrastructure whilst ensuring the 
sustainability and health of marine environments there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Your budget proposes significant cuts to the account that 
funds this project, and proposes to eliminate a number of 
navigation observations and positioning grant programs under 
the National Ocean Service that impact these projects. Please 
explain why you think these programs should be eliminated.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Sure, Congressman Meng. Thanks for your
question. Thanks for your support of our National Ocean Service 
and the offices under it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;The Ocean Service is a particularly high interest item for 
me as--with my degrees in oceanography, and the fact that I've 
been a coastal state resident in three states for my entire 
adult life, and overseas, and so I--and currently live on the 
Chesapeake Bay and I very much enjoy and value our coasts and 
all the work that the Ocean Service does.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    With respect to the project you mentioned, again, our 
rationale behind the budget cuts wasn't that we thought these 
projects weren't good or valuable. It was just that we had to 
apply our cuts somewhere, and so we preserved much good work 
that the Ocean Service does in terms of coastal modeling, 
navigation, and surveying, but it was the grants that--to 
states that we decided to reduce because we just felt the core 
government services that we provided had a higher priority, and 
it wasn't that the work wasn't important. We just had to apply 
the cuts somewhere.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt; Okay. I hope that you will continue to
prioritize. Any way that we can help--I mean, do you believe 
that--piggybacking off of Ranking Member Serrano's comment 
about climate changing and that something is happening within 
our oceans and the climate as a whole?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Oh, absolutely. From my background in the
Navy, where I helped establish the Navy's climate change task 
force, and my scientific experience and knowledge, I am very 
aware of it. In fact, our organization does much great work 
still in terms of monitoring climate and climate change and the 
studies behind it, including the various aspects of it, whether 
it be drought or sea level rise, and we are applying that 
information every day in studies and assessments, and work with 
local officials to help manage and adapt to those changes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;Great. And back to hurricanes a little bit. You
mentioned in your testimony about the accuracy and success of 
many of these programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;NOAA requests a decrease of $4 million in reducing the 
overall computational capacity of research and development in 
high performance computing system. This decrease will eliminate 
one of NOAA's super computing systems jet located in Colorado, 
and reduce the super computing use and associated contract 
support in West Virginia. Some major transition projects 
include hurricane forecast, improvements, next generation 
global prediction system, and storm surge modeling that will no 
longer have use of the super computing system.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt;    Why actively seek--why are you seeking to reduce our 
capability to forecast storms, such as Sandy that devastated 
New York City and the tri-state area? Harvey, Irma, Maria are 
just some examples that you've mentioned.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Yes, Congresswoman, and forgive me for
calling you Congressman up front earlier.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;We--first off those reductions are--they are not--we are 
not zeroing out the programs. We are--we made reductions based 
on the fact that we feel the current funding is sufficient, the 
funding that we have proposed, still to continue to improve our 
work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;For example, we see great opportunity for research super 
computing in the cloud, and our--my counterpart, the Assistant 
Secretary for--of Commerce for Earth Observations and 
Predictions, Dr. Neil Jacobs, comes with great experience in 
that area, and he is already working on plans to leverage cloud 
computing for research applications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;The other piece about improving our modeling in super high 
performance computing to support modeling, we have much 
underway that is very good, and in fact, I will thank you for 
supporting the Sandy supplemental funding because that has led 
to many of the great advances in our weather modeling. We have 
an research or experimental model we call the Global Forecast 
System Finite Volume Cubed, or GFSFV3, that is in the process 
of transitioning to the Weather Service.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    This model outperformed the European models for the 
hurricane track forecast for the three Category IV hurricanes 
that made landfall. So we are--our goal is to regain world 
leadership, take number one back for our weather model, and we 
are on track to do it. We expect to do that before 2020.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Meng&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Ms. Meng"&gt; OK. Thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; This young lady from Alabama.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Roby&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Ms. Roby"&gt;Well, good morning, sir. Thank you. I know you
can tell that this committee is--has good representation from 
the Gulf States. And I want to apologize up front for the 
coming and going. I think every single one of us have all of 
our subcommittees meeting at the same time right now. So I just 
really want to make a quick comment and that is--and if we have 
some questions, we will submit for the record, but I just, 
alongside my colleague, Mr. Palazzo, I just want to commend you 
and the National Marine Fishery Service for your collaboration 
and your approval of allowing the State of Alabama, as well, 
recreational red snapper season to be set at 47 days in 2018 
and next year, as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Ms. Roby"&gt;    We all believe that cutting out the federal red tape and 
getting the local and state leaders involved in decision making 
is a true testament to working together. Each state and fishery 
are unique in our country and having decisions that are made 
jointly is key to finding the appropriate solution. So again, 
thank you so much for all you and your partners do in allowing 
our fisheries in Alabama, and around the nation, to thrive with 
innovative policies and cooperative decision makings. And I 
just want to thank you for your service to our great country 
and appreciate you being here today very much.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Roby&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Ms. Roby"&gt; So thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Thank you, Congresswoman. Thank you for your
support. And I will say that the credit goes to Chris Oliver, 
the director of our National Marine Fishery Service. He has got 
great experience and he is doing the right thing for our 
fisheries. And I thought the red snapper management plan is 
exactly what it should be.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Roby&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Ms. Roby"&gt; Great. Thanks again on being a role model. I will
yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; Mr. Cartwright.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good morning,
Admiral. Thank you for joining us and thank you for your many 
years of public service.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    I want to follow up on Ms. Meng's questioning a little bit 
if I can. I think we are on the same page about the importance 
of climate change research. And I am going to rip through a 
number of quick questions to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Sure. Yes, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    Mr. Cartwright [continuing]. Make sure we are on the same 
page about this. First, do you agree that the past three years 
have been the warmest three years in recorded history?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; To the best of my knowledge, yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; Do you acknowledge that 17 of the 18
warmest years on record have happened since the millennium, 
2000?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; I will acknowledge that we have seen a trend
in warming. I don't know the exact numbers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; Do you agree--the amount of carbon dioxide
is higher now than at any time in the last 800,000 years and 
largely due to this carbon dioxide, the IPCC believes that 
global temperatures are expected to increase by at least 2.7 
degrees Fahrenheit during the 21st century?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; So I acknowledge that the carbon is at a
record high in terms of the historical record in the atmosphere 
and oceans, but the 2.7 degree forecast rise that the IPCC 
acknowledges is also a forecast with uncertainty.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; OK. Do you agree that global sea level rise
in the next century will be better measured in feet and not 
inches?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; I acknowledge that the sea level is rising.
And again, forecasting the amount it will rise by the end of 
the century is--there is a significant uncertainty in our 
ability to do that accurately.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; And finally, you acknowledged that we still
have a lot more to learn about climate change and its dramatic 
effects on almost everything we do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; So I think you and I both recognize this.
The subtle science on climate change, and we both know it is an 
existential threat to everything we know, I think we can agree 
we need to improve our understanding of climate change so that 
we can adapt and mitigate its effects. Fair statement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; I would say that that is--it is important to
continue our NOAA research behind climate change because there 
is much we still don't know.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, has
repeatedly stated that carbon dioxide is not a primary 
contributor to the warming that we observed. Did you know he 
said that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; Last fall, you presented the
administration's three top priorities for NOAA and let me make 
sure I have them correct before I dive into it. Number one, 
leading the world in weather prediction. Number two, minimizing 
the impacts from severe weather. Number three, increasing 
sustainable economic contributions from our fisheries and 
oceans. Have I got all of that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; And I notice that climate change is missing
and for years NOAA has played an essential role in deepening 
our understanding of climate change, does that concern you? I 
know you have said in the past that, ``The administration will 
continue to support NOAA's climate mission.'' Are you concerned 
about dropping that off the list?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; I would say it is imbedded within all three
of those priorities, Congressman. In fact, so when we talk--in 
my opening statement, we have combined those first two 
priorities to what we call a weather and water priority and 
minimizing the impacts of extreme events. And so that involves 
events on scales that are in weeks to seasonal and even sub-
seasonal, and climate type of scales.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; All right. I am looking at the numbers in
your budget requests and it seems to me the administration has 
proposed to cut NOAA by over a billion dollars. That is about a 
20 percent cut. Am I reading that correctly?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; That is troubling. Let's talk about some of
these cuts. Admiral, let's look how they align with the 
administration's priorities for NOAA, how they align with our 
shared understanding. Budget proposed is stripping $2.4 million 
from regional climate centers, which answer millions of 
requests from businesses, farmers, and local communities every 
year. Am I correct in that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; It will eliminate the climate resilience
grants to states. And now the climate resilience grants showed 
us that for every one dollar invested in resilience, it results 
in $6 in savings from future extreme weather damages. Am I 
correct in that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; I don't know the exact number, sir, but I
know that there is--the work our climate predictions provides 
the country saves money and lives.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; The budget will eliminate the climate
competitive research grants, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; It will dismantle, and that is the language
the administration used, the climate program office as it 
currently exists, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; I am unaware of that. That office is still
funded in the fiscal year 2019 budget, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; The budget will cut research on ocean
acidification by 23.4 percent. Am I correct in that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; Even though ocean acidification can
potentially harm and deplete our fishing stocks, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; We are still continuing--even though there
is a reduction in the funding, we still continue to do that 
research to support shellfish growers, for example, in the 
State of Washington. So yes, there are reductions in the 
program, but we are still looking at it, studying it, and 
supporting those who are affected by it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; We will come back to this, but the budget
also proposes decreases to hurricane forecasting research, 
doesn't it, even though hurricanes cost our country an eye 
popping $306 billion in damages last year, and even though 
400,000 American citizens in Puerto Rico are still without 
power over seven months after Hurricane Maria, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; So the rationale, as I mentioned earlier,
Congressman, was not to--we didn't remove all hurricane 
research, for example. As I mentioned to Congresswoman Meng, we 
have a very solid and robust research program supporting 
hurricane forecast research. I went down to our Atlantic 
Oceanography and Meteorology Laboratory last week in Miami that 
has a hurricane research division. They are, and continue, and 
will be doing in this fiscal year 2019 budget terrific work to 
improve our hurricane forecasting and the research behind it. 
So we haven't zeroed it out. We have just made reductions in 
various areas we thought either were redundant or were--we had 
sufficient capability.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; I think we will come back to this, but at
this point, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;Thank you. Let me switch gears and talk a
little bit about--we have talked a little bit about hurricanes. 
Let me talk a little bit about tornadoes, as we had mentioned 
briefly before the hearing started. Of course, tornadoes in the 
southeast result in more deaths per capita than any other 
region in the United States. Since 2015, we have been funding 
the VORTEX-southeast program, SE program, which brings together 
meteorologists, researchers, and social scientists to better 
understand the storms and conditions that cause tornadoes in 
the southeastern part of the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;    Can you share a little bit about what the program has 
accomplished thus far and how it will help protect the folks 
that I represent back in Alabama from these deadly tornadoes?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Yes, Mr. Chairman. The VORTEX program I
think is a terrific one. Yeah, over the last year I know that 
our--it has been managed by our national severe storm lab in 
Oklahoma, but they have partners in your state that they have 
actively done field research in to study the damage, for 
example, at different--where different tornadoes have occurred 
in Alabama.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;And then with that information, they have been able to 
reduce the uncertainty in tornado warnings and predictions and 
also better understand the decision/support type of work and 
how we provide warnings to emergency managers and the advice 
they should give the people because of the different nature of 
the storms in that--in, say, your region to those, say, in 
Texas. And so there has been great, I think, advances made by 
that program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="579" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    I note your concern about the fact that the 2019 budget 
reduces that funding for the VORTEX program. And again, that 
was one where we felt that the national severe storm lab was 
still doing, with their baseline funding, had a good tornado 
research program, as required by the Weather Act I mentioned in 
my opening statement. So we didn't pull back all the research 
in terms of tornado warning, but we made a reduction based 
again on what we thought was a sufficient level of capability.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;OK. Well, please know that this is certainly
important to us in the southeast and, of course, in Alabama, my 
home State.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt;    It is my understanding that half of NOAA's ships are past 
their designated service life and are scheduled to retire by 
2028, is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; In light of that, NOAA has proposed $75
million each year to recapitalize its fleet. Before buying new 
ships for NOAA, we want to ensure that NOAA is fully utilizing 
commercial and partner assets. How does NOAA determine whether 
a mission can be completed by a partner vessel or are there 
additional missions that NOAA can use external ships to 
complete or reduce pressure on the NOAA fleets?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Yes, sir. We perform our oceanographic and
hydrographic and fisheries research work with actually a kind 
of suite where we have our own vessels, but we also match that 
with sometimes contracted vessel support. And we do this in 
hydrography all the time. In fact, I would say it is roughly, I 
think 43 percent of our hydrographic surveys are contracted. 
The reason I think we can't entirely contract and use partner 
vessels, even though--because ships are expensive, is the fact 
that there are just some capabilities and instances where we 
will need a government only solution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    A great example was the hurricane season, sir. NOAA's ship, 
Thomas Jefferson, was able to go in to Puerto Rico and all 
around the southeast, actually, right after the storms hit and 
do critical hydrographic surveys to open ports. Now, that ship 
opened up 18 ports in as many days following Hurricane Maria in 
the U.S. Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico. And so that was 
something we, a surge capability we just couldn't contract out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; OK. Let me go ahead and Mr. Serrano.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Maybe this is not a question for you, but for
other people, but I would like to get an answer from as many 
people as I can. Right after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico 
and the devastation that we saw, that many people claim is the 
worst ever under the American flag, it took such a long time 
for things to get going. And some of the excuses they were 
giving was that Puerto Rico was an island. And I sarcastically, 
or profoundly, said it was easy to invade it in 1898, so it was 
probably not difficult to reach it now. What was the problem? 
Was it administrative delays? Was it indifference, if you are 
free to say that? Is it the fact that it is a territory and 
they don't play in the same ballfield as states? I mean, 
something went wrong. Here goes that phrase again. Something 
went wrong and even people who are keeping quiet about it 
because they don't want to attack the administration or the 
agencies know that something went wrong.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Well, Congressman, again as I mentioned
earlier based on personal experience, the people of Puerto Rico 
have my deepest sympathy. In my position at NOAA, I really--it 
is not mine to comment on the overall response of first 
responders and of FEMA. I met with Brock Long and we have a 
great partnership. I think I can tell you that NOAA's response, 
as I mentioned with the ship, Thomas Jefferson, and much the 
work we are doing now to remove derelict vessels and areas 
where hazardous material and oil has been spilled, restored 
habitat in many areas that--and thank you again for the 
supplemental appropriations, which we will apply. It is a very 
good effect in Puerto Rico and other areas that were affected.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="589" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    So I can tell you that NOAA's response has been terrific 
and I am very proud of the people of my organization.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="590" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Thank you. Well, you know, I just wanted to
throw more information into the pot, if you will, because I 
have no qualms with NOAA. NOAA and NASA are two of our favorite 
agencies here, you know, except you are not sending anybody out 
into space anytime soon, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="591" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; No, sir. No, and we are not funded to do it
either. But I will tell you that we have----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="592" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Some staff members only.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="593" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; The former administrator had some experience
there, you know. But we have a very active ocean exploration 
program with our ship, Okeanos Explorer, which is discovering 
new things every year: a new species, new phenomena, and I 
think it is a program we are really proud of.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="594" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; That is great. That is great. Among the many
NOAA programs the administration wants to eliminate are the 
National Sea Grant Program and the Educational Partnership 
Program with Minority Serving Institutions. Among the many 
benefits these programs have provided is that they have 
encouraged a pipeline of talented young scientists to choose 
careers at NOAA. Admiral, won't the elimination of these 
programs harm NOAA's ability to maintain a high quality work 
force in many critical areas? I mean, you have been getting a 
lot of talent from those programs. How difficult is it going to 
be now?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="595" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Well, I will acknowledge and thank you for
your support of both of those programs. And I will say that the 
sea grant program is a great one. It is very--we have recruited 
out of sea grants and the educational partnership program great 
talent. I have met many of our--of scientists in NOAA now who 
are veterans of those two programs. And in fact, last month, I 
spoke at the educational partnership program event at Howard 
University and I was able to see some new, young students who 
are all doing great research and partnership with NOAA. NOAA 
mentors these students. Our scientists enjoy that. And we gain 
because of it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="596" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    So I will tell you yes. We have benefitted from and we have 
been able to build a more diverse workforce based on those--
support from those two programs. So they are important. I can 
only explain to you how previously that we had to make some 
tough calls given the cuts we were required to execute. And so 
some of the core services, like weather forecasting and the 
oceanographic and hydrographic surveys, are what we preserved.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="597" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Thank you. One last question here, Admiral.
Would you please talk about the backlog of maintenance and 
repair needs at weather forecast offices? How bad is the 
problem, and to what extent is the backlog further harming the 
ability of the National Weather Service to make timely and 
accurate weather forecasts?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="598" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Thank you, Congressman. And again, I really
appreciate your support to the weather service. It is just a 
really terrific organization, affecting Americans for the 
better every day. Yes, we have identified facilities across all 
of the weather service that are in need of repair. And I don't 
believe they are posing significant risk to the mission today. 
We are still saving lives, protecting property all across the 
country. And we proved it during this hurricane season.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="599" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    But you are correct in acknowledging that I am concerned 
about a number of our facilities and that--not only at the 
Weather Service, but across all of NOAA. And so we are looking 
closely at what we need to recapitalize at fisheries too, and 
in other locations to ensure our workforce has the best place 
to do the best job.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="600" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Thank you. Just one last comment, a selfish
comment, but important to our districts. Some years ago, you 
set up a weather station at a community center populated by a 
lot of young people in my community. And in all honesty, you 
know, the years go by and I don't know in what condition that 
weather station is. If you could just check on it to see if it 
is where it should be because at one point, we were having 
local cable T.V. channels pick up the weather forecast from the 
weather station at the community center, which was really a 
great thrill for the kids and a great learning experience. So 
if you could just check on that, we would appreciate it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="601" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; We sure will, Congressman. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Serrano&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="602" speaker="Mr. Serrano"&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Aderholt&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="603" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"&gt; Mr. Cartwright.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="604" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral, I want to
pick up on--we were talking about some specific cuts and really 
these are--the overall budget is something that comes from the 
administration and some--many of the folks in your position are 
treated as, well, this is something we have to live with that 
is coming down from on high. And we have talked about some of 
the comments from the administration officials basically 
denying climate change. A lot of the cuts seem to align with 
those beliefs. I went through a bunch of them with you already.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="605" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    The one that may be absolutely heartbreaking to you, 
Admiral, is the administration has proposed eliminating the 
arctic climate research program, hasn't it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="606" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="607" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; And I know you spent much of your career
working on arctic research. Are you concerned about the effects 
of the elimination of that program on our national security?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Congressman, I thank you for your interest
in this important area. I am not concerned because we are 
doing--even though that research line has been eliminated, it 
doesn't mean we are not doing arctic research. I was just at 
the Pacific marine environmental lab in Seattle and they have a 
very active program that is continuing various lines of arctic 
research, but not in the name of an arctic research program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;For example, we have just contracted with an organization 
called Saildrone that operates unmanned surface vehicles. And 
we actually executed an arctic survey this year, just near the 
Bering Sea. And so we are undertaking a good amount of arctic 
research in the ocean and on the ice and we operate the 
National Ice Center in Suitland, Maryland, which I encourage 
you to visit sometime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    So we do have a fairly--we are still continuing to do 
arctic research, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; I want to follow up about talking about
ice. I know NOAA published its 2017 arctic report card last 
December. It found that the arctic was warming at a rate that 
was unprecedented. Am I correct in that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; That is something the world has not seen in
the last 1,500 years, am I correct in that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; I don't know the exact number, sir, but it
has been warming, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; And it is warming at twice the rate of the
rest of the globe in the arctic, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; That is correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; Last month, arctic sea ice, which we were
just talking about, hit a record low, never before seen in the 
satellite era, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; For the winter, yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; And it was 62,000 square miles smaller than
the previous record set just the previous year, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; Well, warmth in the arctic affects the jet
stream, does it not?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Yes, sir, it does.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; And you said that before. What you said
was, ``Unlike Vegas, what happens in the arctic doesn't stay in 
the arctic, it affects the rest of the planet.'' Have I quoted 
you correctly?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; You have done your homework, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; All right. Well, Admiral, you were the one
who delivered the 2017 arctic report card to the 
administration, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Correct, yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; And you said, ``The public should have high
confidence in us,'' and that, ``The White House is addressing 
the report, acknowledging it, and factoring it into its 
agenda.'' Did you say that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; That is correct. The Office of Science and
Technology policy under the White House is supporting our 
arctic research efforts.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; But with all these cuts to climate
research, does it not seem like the White House is failing to 
address it and properly factor it into its agenda?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="630" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Again, sir, I think that the answer is no.
The Office of Science and Technology policy under the White 
House has supported, for example, our arctic research and the--
if not zeroed out our climate work. If you go to drought.gov or 
the Climate Prediction Center's website, you will see that we 
continue to put out seasonal and long range outlooks that are 
benefitting Americans and businesses in terms of drought 
temperature.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="631" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;We continue to look at the arctic and support arctic with 
research and forecasting. The Navy recently completed or is 
conducting--just conducted its ice exercise, something I 
attended two years up in the (indiscernible) where two 
submarines were basically doing research and tactical 
development. And we provided forecasts for--of the ice and the 
weather that supported the safety of those operations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    So I believe that through NOAA, we are continuing to do 
very good work. We haven't eliminated our climate work, it has 
just been reduced.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; Well, I want to leave you with this. I want
to have confidence in you, Admiral Gallaudet, and I do. You are 
clearly a good scientist, an able leader. I would say a good 
soldier or in your case sailor----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Sailor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    Mr. Cartwright [continuing]. Sticking up for the folks up 
top. But looking at this budget, I just don't have confidence 
in the administration. I think this budget is going to hurt our 
national security. I think it is going to hurt our economy. I 
think it is going to hurt our country and the world for 
generations to come. And I think this is a budget written by 
climate deniers that would derail the great work that has been 
going on, largely under your leadership at NOAA. And I hope 
this committee can fix the serious problems in this budget 
proposal. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt; Thank you, Chairman. And thank you, Admiral,
for being with us. I have got a few things I was hoping to ask 
about. First off, I would like to ask for a status update on 
the process of distributing funds to communities impacted by 
recent fisheries disasters. As you know, Congress approved $200 
million in supplemental funding to support those communities, 
but they continue to wait for relief while the agency works to 
develop a plan for how to distribute those funds. Can you tell 
the committee what the process--you know, when the process will 
be completed so that those funds can get out the door? We have 
got communities and folks who have been waiting for years.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Yes, Congressman. Thank you for your support
of NOAA and your interest in this issue of fisheries disasters. 
We have developed a spend plan on how to allocate the $200 
million of funding, both for the west coast fisheries disasters 
that were declared in 2017 and, of course, those that were 
declared in the wake of the hurricane season.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    And so our spend plan is currently being reviewed at the 
department and will go to OMB we hope by the end of the--in the 
next two weeks or so. And then when OMB approves that, then we 
will be able to share--we will share with the states the 
allocations and then we will figure out exactly what those will 
fund in concert with your state and others.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt; Great. If that is something once it is cooked
by OMB that you can share with us, it would be very helpful.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Absolutely, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Thanks. I want to shift gears and thank you for
visiting my state and learn more about the NOAA programs that 
are done in partnership with UW and that are pretty central to 
the economy in the Pacific northwest. In our neck of the woods, 
one of the most important programs is the IOOS program, which 
provides some real time data about ocean conditions, that is 
used by fishermen, and shellfish growers, and a host of other 
industries, and agencies, and stakeholders. Unfortunately, the 
fiscal year 2019 budget doesn't reflect the value of this 
program. The proposed cut of more than 30 percent would really 
cripple that system and jeopardize the livelihoods of folks 
that rely on that data, not to mention the impact it would have 
on other critical services, like search and rescue, and flood 
warnings, and navigation safety that also depend on this data.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    Now that you were able to go to Washington State and see 
the value and success of that program, I would be interested to 
hear whether you believe it is in the Nation's best interest 
for NOAA to divest from that critical program.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; That is a great question, Congressman, and I
have met with all the IOOS regional managers just recently in 
Washington, DC and I will say--I will agree it is a very 
important and impactful program. Being a career oceanographer, 
I get it very well. Again, as I mentioned, I don't think you 
were in the room, but we--in coming up with our fiscal year 
2019 budget, we had to make some tough calls. And we decided to 
prioritize core government services, and so grants and local 
related work was what we had--we picked to reduce or in some 
cases eliminate, not because we didn't think they were 
important or good, it was just that we had to prioritize.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;Finally, let me ask about the role your agency
plays in mitigating coastal hazards. About 40 percent of the 
U.S. population lives in coastal areas, so NOAA is very 
important in everything from protecting communities from 
hurricanes, to tsunamis, to sea level rise. Unfortunately, the 
administration hasn't made this a priority. The district I 
represent is already experiencing some of the threats of sea 
level rise. We also happen to be a tsunami zone. So NOAA is an 
incredibly important partner in our region from the national 
tsunami hazard mitigation program to regional coastal 
resiliency grants.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt;    NOAA provides a lot of funding and expertise that is really 
important for communities like Westport, where I was just last 
Friday, and Neah Bay, Ocean Shores. I could give you countless 
examples from my home state. But the fact is, every single 
coastal state, roughly half of all states in the Nation, 
benefit from these programs. In my view, we should be doubling 
down on them because these are communities that are really at 
risk. That is what I am going to advocate as part of this 
committee. And I am not going to ask you to defend the proposed 
cuts to these programs, but I would like you to tell the 
committee how these cuts would affect NOAA's ability to 
continue to protect vulnerable coastal communities?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Sure, Congressman. And I, again, have deep
appreciation for your interest and support of these--of the 
coastal zone management programs and resiliency efforts that we 
will leave reduced. Again, we are not eliminating all of our 
coastal work and support, if you will. I mentioned this to 
Congressman Meng, that I have been a coastal state resident in 
three states and several countries, so I--and I live on the 
Chesapeake Bay. So I very much appreciate these programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;And I will tell you, there is good work that will continue. 
Habitat restoration, for example, in Louisiana I visited a 
restored marsh that had been under water for decades that we 
restored and that is--that provided an effective storm surge 
barrier during this hurricane season to the residents of that 
state.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    And in your state, there is great work we are doing too. We 
have restored an estuary in your district, I believe, that is 
now very active for the salmon hatchery. We will continue good 
work and we just had to make reductions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt; Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate the time. I
will just say as I yield back, I was in Westport and visited 
the Coast Guard station there and was meeting with a group of 
Guard members and their families and asked them, ``What is 
keeping you up at night?'' And the number of people who have 
mentioned the risk of tsunami was really significant.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Well, and that is great, sir. I will say,
though, that again we continue to fund our tsunami program in 
this budget. It is reduced, but not eliminated. And I think the 
men and women that are working at our tsunami warning centers 
are experts, doing very good work, and we will--it is important 
for us to continue that capability.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kilmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Mr. Kilmer"&gt; I agree. Thanks. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt; Thank you very much. Welcome, Admiral, it is
an honor to have you here. I am from West Virginia and NOAA has 
made a real investment in our State. One of your supercomputers 
is in Fairmont, West Virginia, and that has been an important 
driver of high tech talent into our state coming out of our 
universities and bringing people to West Virginia. Can you give 
me any sense of kind of NOAA's view of that positioning in West 
Virginia, and the supercomputer, and your investment in our 
state, and the future that you see of NOAA in West Virginia, 
that facility in Fairmont, in particular?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;Yes, Congressman. And thank you for your
interest and support, again. And definitely I enjoy your state. 
I am going to be visiting it next month for the Eagle Horizon 
exercise, that is our backup site, if you will, for when we 
have to do continuity of operations. And I look forward to that 
time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt;    And our supercomputing capability there is important to us. 
It is foundational for our numerical or high performance 
computing numerical weather prediction. And so we will maintain 
our presence in your State because that capability is so 
important.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt; Great. Thank you. There was a proposal for 10
years' worth of contracted work in the $533 million range. I 
appreciate your comments about the continued commitment to West 
Virginia. On your radar screen, some of this potential 
contracted work, half a billion dollars in West Virginia at 
this facility, your familiarity, what the game plan is, and 
what the outlook is?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Gallaudet&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Mr. Gallaudet"&gt; Sir, I actually can't comment. I am not a--I
will have to take this for the record on what our exact--in the 
fiscal year 2019 budget, what our program funds are for and our 
plans going forward in the future. I don't recall the numbers 
and so I will have to come back to you with that one.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Jenkins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Right. Thank you. I have no further questions.
Thank you for being here. I understand we have had two rounds 
already, so unless there is nothing else, I will move that this 
hearing is adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Mr. Jenkins"&gt;Wednesday, April 18, 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
