    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREGG HARPER, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;We will call to order the hearing today on the
Drug Enforcement Administration's role in combating the opioid 
epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Today, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations 
convenes a hearing on the DEA's role in combating the opioid 
epidemic. This crisis is a top priority of the nation and 
certainly of this committee and subcommittee. Opioid-related 
overdoses killed more than 42,000 people in 2016. That's an 
average of 115 deaths each day. An estimated 2.1 million people 
have an opioid use disorder.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Since our earliest hearings in 2012, this subcommittee has 
been investigating various aspects of this epidemic. In May 
2017, the Committee opened a bipartisan investigation into 
allegations of ``opioid-dumping,'' a term to describe 
inordinate volumes of opioids shipped by wholesale drug 
distributors to pharmacies located in rural communities, such 
as those in West Virginia. From press reports and this 
investigation, we have learned of opioid shipments in West 
Virginia that shock the conscience.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Over 10 years, 20.8 million opioids were shipped to 
pharmacies in the town of Williamson, home to approximately 
3,000 people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Another 9 million opioids were distributed in just 2 years 
to a single pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, with a 
population of 406.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Between 2007 and 2012, drug distributors shipped more than 
780 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills in West Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;These troubling examples raise serious questions about 
compliance with the Controlled Substances Act, administered by 
the DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The CSA was enacted through this committee in 1970. This 
law established schedules of controlled substances and provided 
the authority for the DEA to register entities engaged in the 
manufacture, distribution, or dispensation of controlled 
substances. The CSA was designed to combat diversion by 
providing for a closed system of drug distribution in which all 
legitimate handlers of controlled substances must maintain a 
DEA registration, and as a condition of maintaining such 
registration must take reasonable steps to ensure their 
registration is not being used as a source of diversion. The 
DEA regulations specifically require all distributors to report 
suspicious orders of controlled substances in addition to the 
statutory responsibility to exercise due diligence to avoid 
filling suspicious orders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;This hearing has two goals. First, the subcommittee seeks 
to determine how the DEA could have done better to detect and 
investigate suspicious orders of opioids, such as the massive 
amounts shipped to West Virginia. The DEA has acknowledged to 
the committee that it could have done better in spotting and 
investigating suspicious opioid shipments. What were the 
deficiencies and has DEA addressed them? DEA has a 
comprehensive electronic database containing specific 
information at the pharmacy level. Could DEA use that database 
more effectively to investigate diversion and to facilitate 
compliance for the regulated industry?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The second goal is to find out whether the current DEA law 
enforcement approach is adequately protecting public safety. 
DEA statistics reveal a sharp decline since 2012 in certain DEA 
enforcement actions, immediate suspension orders, or ISOs, and 
orders to show cause. The number of ISOs issued by the DEA 
plummeted from 65 in 2011 to just six last year. Former DEA 
officials alleged in the Washington Post and on CBS' ``60 
Minutes'' that the DEA's Office of Chief Counsel imposed 
evidentiary obstacles and delays for ISO and for orders to show 
cause submissions from the DEA field. The conflict between the 
DEA lawyers and the DEA investigators allegedly resulted in 
experienced DEA personnel leaving the agency and a loss of 
morale.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The goal of laws regulating controlled substances is to 
strike the right balance between the public interest in 
legitimate patients obtaining medications in a timely manner 
against another weighty public interest in preventing the 
illegal diversion of prescription drugs, particularly given the 
rampant and deadly opioid epidemic throughout the Nation. Our 
investigation is intended to assist the committee's continuing 
legislative effort to strike the right balance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;It is unfortunate that it's been a battle to get 
information out of the DEA. We have made recent progress with 
the DEA, but at this time our investigation still does not have 
the full picture. DEA has made some commitments that should 
hopefully help the committee gain the information it needs, and 
we expect the DEA to honor those commitments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And I welcome today's witness, DEA Acting Administrator 
Robert Patterson. We have serious concerns about policy that we 
need to discuss today. But we are steadfast in our support and 
certainly want to salute the dedicated workforce at the DEA. We 
need an effective DEA in this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. Gregg Harper"&gt;    I also want to thank the Minority for their partnership and 
hard work in this investigation. I now yield to my friend, the 
Ranking Member, Ms. DeGette.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;And I am happy to kick off the whole series of hearings 
with the Energy and Commerce Committee this week with this 
Oversight and Investigations hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Opioid overdose is now the number-one cause of 
unintentional death in the United States. Every day we hear 
reports of Americans dying and leaving loved ones, often 
children, to pick up the pieces, and these reports are 
heartbreaking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;The crisis has also had an economic toll. Estimates are 
that it's cost this country a trillion dollars since 2001, and 
here's the point at my opening statement where I show that 
Congress can still be bipartisan because today I want to talk, 
as the chairman did, about our committee investigation, 
examining exactly how the opioid epidemic developed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Our investigation, as the chairman said, focused on West 
Virginia, which has the highest opioid death toll in the 
Nation. The numbers that we are seeing coming out are simply 
shocking. A major 2016 news investigation, for example, 
reported that distributors shipped 780 million opioids to this 
state between 2007 and 2012. Again, in 5 years, they shipped 
780 million opioids to this small State of West Virginia. Now, 
we focus on West Virginia but I am hoping that the lessons we 
learned will apply nationwide, including in my home State of 
Colorado.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Administrator Patterson, I join the Chairman in welcoming 
you here. We have a lot of questions and we'd like to know what 
you think failed us in West Virginia and, more importantly, 
what we can do to avoid this again. We know something had to 
have gone wrong. For example, in DEA's own court filings, in 
2008 the distributor shipped one pharmacy in West Virginia 
22,500 hydrocodone pills per month. But our investigation also 
found that a number of pharmacies were sent even many times 
more that amount. For example, the Chairman talked about 
Kermit, West Virginia. We looked at one pharmacy in Kermit, 
which has a few hundred people. Drug distributors supplied this 
pharmacy with more than 4.3 million doses of opioids, more than 
350,000 per month in a single year, and then the next year 4 
million doses of opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;What on earth were people thinking? Now, when the DEA 
finally shut down this pharmacy and took its owner to court, 
the owner admitted at its height the pharmacy filled one 
prescription per minute. Who could think that this was a 
legitimate use?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;News reports from the time describe pharmacy workers 
throwing bags of opioids ``over a divider and onto a counter to 
keep pace.'' One law enforcement agent noticed a cash drawer 
``so full the clerk could not get it to close properly.'' And 
this was not the only pharmacy to receive such massive 
quantities of opioids. In another example, between 2006 and 
2016, distributors shipped over 20 million doses of opioids to 
two pharmacies in one town of 3,000 people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I want to know if the DEA thinks that this amount of pills 
sent to these pharmacies was excessive. In addition, the 
Controlled Substances Act and applicable regulations required 
the distributor to tell DEA how many pills that distributor 
sold and to what pharmacies. DEA compiles this information into 
a database called the Automation of Reports and Consolidated 
Orders System. It's called ARCOS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I want to know how the DEA made use of ARCOS data from 2006 
on and whether it relied on that data to monitor the number of 
pills that distributors sent to West Virginia. Did the DEA 
perform analytic assessments of the pills the pharmacies 
received? Did it look at how many pills distributors sent to a 
town or region as a whole? And if so, I want to know why the 
DEA didn't act to stop these shipments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I want to know whether the distributors themselves 
exercised appropriate due diligence before sending millions of 
pills to pharmacies. For example, in a letter sent to all drug 
distributors in 2006 and 2007, the DEA gave them a list of 
circumstances that might be indicative of diversion, all of 
which plainly require distributors to know their customers 
before shipping them any opioids at all. I want to know if the 
drug distributors met this standard when they shipped those 
pills to tiny West Virginia and, similarly, did the 
distributors comply with their obligations. And I want to know 
also what the DEA is doing right now to stop painkillers from 
flooding our communities today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;We have had a lot of hearings on this, Mr. Chairman, but 
this is the first one to look in a hard way at this crisis 
developed. We spend countless hours of law enforcement time 
trying to stop illegal drugs from coming into this country and 
here we are, sending millions of doses of opioids to tiny 
little towns in West Virginia, all of this supposedly legally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I think I can speak for the whole committee to say this 
needs to stop, it needs to stop now, and we need to figure out 
how we are going to protect our constituents and our citizens.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREG WALDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GREG WALDEN"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the chairman of the full 
committee, Chairman Walden, for purposes of an opening 
statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your
leadership on this very important issue to the people we 
represent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;For nearly a year, this committee has been investigating 
how inordinate numbers of pills were shipped to pharmacies in 
rural West Virginia. The numbers that we have seen thus far, as 
you've heard, Mr. Patterson, are nothing short of staggering--
more than 20 million prescription opioids shipped to a West 
Virginia town with a population of fewer than 3,000 people. 
Another West Virginia pharmacy, in a town with a population of 
fewer than 2,000 people, received an average of 5,600 
prescription opioids a day during a single year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;As part of our investigation, we have also looked at the 
Sav-Rite pharmacies in Kermit, West Virginia, a town with a 
population of about 400.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;During last October's full committee hearing, I asked your 
colleague at the DEA a very straightforward question: which 
companies provided the Sav-Rite No. 1 pharmacy with so many 
opioids that it ranked 22nd in the entire United States of 
America for the number of hydrocodone pills received in 2006?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;After an extended and unnecessary delay, we finally 
received the DEA data and now know the answer to that question. 
But this isn't the end of the matter, however.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;We have learned that in 2008, a second Sav-Rite location 
opened just 2 miles away from the original pharmacy. However, 
the second Sav-Rite was forced to close and surrender its DEA 
registration after it was raided by federal agents in March 
2009. Now, in most instances, this would be a success story. 
But in this case, the original Sav-Rite pharmacy--the one that 
had received 9 million pills in just 2 years--stayed open for 
another two years, and in those 2 years, Sav-Rite No. 1 
dispensed about 1.5 million pills into the community. So the 
question is, how did that happen? How is it possible?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;The raid on Sav-Rite 2 was based on observations made 
during undercover investigations conducted at both Sav-Rite 
locations as well as a pill mill medical practice. As part of 
the undercover operation, Federal investigators saw pharmacy 
customers sharing drugs with one another in the parking lot, 
and as you've heard, a cash drawer so full the clerk could not 
close it, and learned that the owner of the Sav-Rite pharmacies 
apparently developed a ``get-rich-quick scheme'' with a pill 
mill medical practice. This scheme may have filled their cash 
drawers, but it was devastating to the community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;It doesn't make any sense as to why the DEA did not shut 
down both pharmacies at the same time. They were owned by the 
same person. They were part of the same criminal scheme. DEA 
has acknowledged that breakdowns occurred and lessons were 
learned, in this case and in others.We need to make sure DEA 
has fixed its own problems so that an effective DEA is part of 
the many solutions needed to combat the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;As you know, people are dying. Lives are being ruined. We 
must be united in our efforts to end this horrible epidemic. 
That is why myself and this entire committee have been so 
frustrated that it has taken so long to obtain DEA's full 
cooperation in this investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And while progress is being made in DEA's efforts--and I 
appreciated our meeting on Friday--we still have plenty of 
unanswered questions coming in to today's hearing. So I am 
hopeful we can learn the answers to those questions today and I 
am also pleased with the commitments DEA has made to fulfill 
our remaining requests in this investigation. And I expect 
those commitments to be honored, period. If they are not, we'll 
be back talking again soon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Our most pressing questions are intended to get DEA on a 
better path. Every one of us on this dais and in this room 
supports a strong and effective DEA. We know you have an 
enormous and important job to do with dedicated agents and we 
are grateful to all those in law enforcement personnel at your 
agency. Quite simply, we want you to have the tools and the 
resources you need to help us combat this epidemic, among the 
other many duties you have at DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So I want to thank you for again being with us today, 
Acting Administrator Patterson, and we look forward to your 
candor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And I would like to yield the balance of my time to the 
gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Griffith. Before I do that, I 
would remind the committee we will have two full days of 
hearings starting tomorrow and Thursday reviewing 25 pieces of 
legislation on the opioids epidemic, and we hope and expect 
everyone on the committee to attend those hearings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;Prepared statement of Hon. Greg Walden&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;With that, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing on DEA's 
role incombating the opioid epidemic, a top priority of this 
committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;For nearly a year, this committee has been investigating 
how inordinate numbers of pills were shipped to pharmacies in 
rural West Virginia. The numbers that we have seen thus far are 
nothing short of staggering--more than 20 million prescription 
opioids shipped to a West Virginia town with a population of 
fewer than 3,000 people. Another West Virginia pharmacy, in a 
town with a population of fewer than 2,000 people, received an 
average of more than 5,600 prescription opioids a day during a 
single year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;As part of our investigation, we have also looked at the 
Sav-Rite pharmacies in Kermit, West Virginia, a town with a 
population of approximately 400 people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;During last October's full committee hearing, I asked your 
colleague at the DEA a very straightforward question: Which 
companies provided the Sav-Rite #1 pharmacy with so many 
opioids that it ranked 22nd in the entire country for the 
number of hydrocodone pills received in 2006?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;After extended delay, we received the DEA data and now know 
the answer to that question. This is not the end of the matter, 
however.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;We have learned that in 2008, a second Sav-Rite location 
opened, just two miles away from the original pharmacy. 
However, the second Sav Rite was forced to close and surrender 
its DEA registration after it was raided by federal agents in 
March 2009. In most instances, this would be a success story. 
But in this case, the original Sav-Rite pharmacy-the one that 
received 9 million pills in just 2 years-stayed open for more 
than two years. In those two years, Sav-Rite #1 dispensed about 
1.5 million pills into the community. How is this possible?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;The raid on Sav-Rite 2 was based on observations made 
during undercover investigations conducted at both Sav-Rite 
locations as well as a pill mill medical practice. As part of 
the undercover operation, federal investigators saw pharmacy 
customers sharing drugs with one another in the parking lot, a 
cash drawer so full that the clerk could not close it, and

    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;People are dying. Lives are being ruined. We must be united 
in our efforts to end this horrible epidemic. That is why 
myself and this entire committee have been so frustrated that 
it has taken this long to obtain DEA's full cooperation in this 
investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;And while progress is being made in DEA's efforts, we still 
have plenty of unanswered questions coming into today's 
hearing. I am hopeful that we can learn the answers to those 
questions today. I am also pleased with the commitments DEA has 
made to fulfill our remaining requests in this investigation. I 
expect those commitments to be honored. If they are not, we'll 
be back here again soon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;Our most pressing questions are intended to get DEA on a 
better path. Every one of us on this dais, and in this room, 
supports a strong and effective DEA. We know you have an 
enormous job to do and we are grateful to all of the dedicated 
law enforcement personnel at the agency. Quite simply, we want 
you to have the tools and the resources you need to combat this 
epidemic, among the other many duties of the DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden"&gt;    So thank you again for being here with us today, Acting 
Administrator Patterson. We look forward to your candor, and I 
would like to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman 
from Virginia, Mr. Griffith.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;We have an implied constitutional responsibility to conduct 
oversight and ensure that the Controlled Substances Act strikes 
the correct balance between the public interest in legitimate 
patients obtaining medications against the weighty public 
interest in preventing the illegal diversion of prescription 
drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;A key issue is whether the DEA is adequately protecting 
public safety. DEA statistics reveal a sharp decline and 
immediate suspension orders--ISOs--since 2012. ISOs are a DEA 
administrative tool not to punish but to protect the public 
from rogue doctors or pharmacists who would continue to provide 
opioids to drug abusers unless their registration was 
immediately suspended.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Former DEA officials alleged in the Washington Post and on 
CBS ``60 Minutes'' that the DEA's office of chief counsel, 
starting around 2013, changed its evidentiary requirements for 
ISO submissions from the DEA field. DEA documents provided to 
the Committee seem to substantiate this allegation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Now, ISOs remind me of DUI cases in Virginia. When a police 
officer gets a driver off the road who's been drinking, their 
license to drive is administratively suspended in order to 
protect the public.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Trial on the merits is delayed, but not public safety. It's 
a similar principle here. Immediately suspend the rogue 
operator and protect the public.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR., A REPRESENTATIVEIN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. FRANK PALLONE"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the ranking member of the full 
committee, Mr. Pallone, for five minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;The opioid epidemic continues to devastate communities and 
families in every part of America, and every day 115 Americans 
lose their lives in an opioid overdose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;We must do more to help those struggling with addiction, 
and I am committed to working with all of my colleagues to 
advance meaningful legislation and resources to help combat 
this crisis. Families all across this nation are looking to us 
for help, and it is my hope that DEA will work cooperatively 
with us on this effort.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;In addition to advancing efforts to respond to this crisis, 
Congress also has a responsibility to figure out what went 
wrong and how it went wrong and how to make sure something like 
this never happens again. And that is why this committee has 
been engaged in a bipartisan investigation into the role both 
DEA and drug distributors have in addressing the ongoing opioid 
crisis and what systems failed to protect the communities that 
have been so overwhelmed by this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So I hope that the lessons we learn will help us address 
this urgent problem throughout the country, from New Jersey to 
West Virginia and beyond.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Clearly, something went wrong. The safeguards designed to 
prevent opioids from being diverted into the wrong hands simply 
did not work and our committee's investigation has found that 
drug distributors shipped millions of pills to multiple small-
town pharmacies in West Virginia every year. For example, a 
pharmacy in a town of 2,000 people received 16.5 million doses 
of opioids over a 10-year period and there were other 
pharmacies in that area as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;There is simply no way that there was an actual medical 
need for this incredible volume of opioids in this rural 
sparsely-populated area and I would hope that DEA can tell us 
what broke down in the safeguards that should have protected 
communities from these abusive practices. These include 
failures by both the distributors and the DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;For example, I have questions about the data that DEA 
collects and why they did not use it more aggressively to 
prevent the oversupply of opioids in certain--in certain cases. 
We know that distributors are required to tell DEA how many 
pills they ship each month and where those pills go. It is not 
clear, however, that DEA has used this data in the past, and if 
DEA is using this data now to help it curtail excessive pill 
distribution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Distributors are also required to alert DEA when a pharmacy 
places an order for what appears to be a suspiciously large 
quantity of pills. It appears that distributors have not always 
alerted DEA of those suspicious orders and may not even have 
had adequate systems in place to identify inappropriately large 
orders. But at the same time, it is also not clear that DEA has 
always done enough with the suspicious orders they receive from 
distributors to alert the agency to possible anomalous 
shipments, and I hope we can get answers to both of these 
questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And when multiple distributors ship to a single pharmacy, 
possibly causing an oversupply, it is not clear that DEA has 
had an adequate system to identify and flag to the distributors 
that an oversupply problem may be unfolding. Unlike DEA, who 
has access to comprehensive distribution data, distributors can 
only see what they supply to an individual pharmacy. Yet, if 
DEA is not flagging when multiple distributors are at risk of 
collectively oversupplying a pharmacy, then the result is 
another example of a system failure that can lead to diversion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So it seems likely that failing to report suspicious orders 
by distributors has hurt DEA's ability to monitor the 
distribution of controlled substances and I hope that we will 
hear that this is no longer an issue today, and if it is, I'd 
like to know what tools DEA needs to help it to enforce this 
requirement. At the same time, I do hope that DEA is making 
full use of suspicious orders when they are reported to their 
field offices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Finally, Mr. Chairman, while our investigation has focused 
on what went wrong in West Virginia, I also want to know how 
DEA is monitoring distributors across the country now. 
Addictive drugs are still abundant in our communities and now 
new opioids are also being introduced to the market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So I hope that DEA is actively or proactively analyzing 
shipments of these pills and, where appropriate, stepping in 
and stopping the over-distribution of these drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So I just want to thank Administrator Patterson for 
appearing before us. This issue is extraordinarily important 
and no entity can address it alone. DEA and Congress must be 
allies in combating the opioid crisis and only by understanding 
what went wrong can we fix this system for the future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So just, again, I know you're in the hot seat today but 
this is something that we need to work on together.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

testimony under oath.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Do you have any objection to testifying under oath?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I do not.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;TESTIMONY OF ROBERT W. PATTERSON, ACTING ADMINISTRATOR, DRUGENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="TESTIMONY OF ROBERT W. PATTERSON"&gt;    Thank you again for being here, Mr. Patterson.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Thank you, and good morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Committee Chairman Walden, Subcommittee Chairman Harper, 
Ranking Members Pallone and DeGette, and distinguished members 
of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to be here 
today to discuss the opioid epidemic and DEA's role in 
combating this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Over the past 15 years, our nation has been increasingly 
devastated by opioid abuse, an epidemic fueled for a 
significant period of time by the overprescribing of potent 
prescription opioids for acute and chronic pain. This 
indiscriminate practice created a generation of opioid abusers, 
presently estimated at more than 3 million Americans.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Over the past few years, we have begun to see a dramatic 
and disturbing shift. As a result of the increased awareness of 
the opioid epidemic, prescriptions for opioids have started to 
decline--obviously, somewhat a success. But organizations, in 
particular the well-positioned--in particular, the well-
positioned Mexican drug cartels have filled this void by 
producing and distributing cheap powdered heroin, often mixed 
with illicit fentanyl and other fentanyl-related substances and 
selling it to users in both traditional powder form and, in 
some cases, pressed into counterfeit pills made to resemble 
illicit pharmaceuticals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;There are two central elements DEA is addressing as part of 
this administration's collective efforts to turn this tide, 
with a third piece that must also be addressed. First and 
foremost is enforcement. Based on our investigations, actions 
are undertaken every day using our criminal, civil, or 
administrative tools to attack the traffic in illicit drugs and 
the diversion of the licit supply.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Second is education. I strongly believe there is a real 
value and a natural fit for the DEA in this space and look 
whenever possible to partner with leaders in prevention and 
education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;The third element is treatment. The DEA is committed to 
doing what we can to improve access to drug treatment and 
recovery services, working alongside our partners at the 
Department of Health and Human Services, to utilize evidence-
based strategies that minimize the risk of diversion during 
this public health emergency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Ultimately, the only way to fundamentally change this 
epidemic is to decrease demand for these substances and address 
the global licit and illicit supply concerns through the 
efforts of DEA and all of its partners. The action of DEA's 
Diversion Control Division are critical with respect to 
addressing the licit supply. Diversion of prescription opioids 
by a few has a disproportionate impact on the availability of 
prescription opioids. The fact remains that a majority of new 
heroin users stated that they started their cycle of addiction 
on prescription opioids. As a result, we are constantly 
evaluating ways to improve our effectiveness to ensure that our 
more than 1.7 million registrants comply with the law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Our use of administrative tools and legislation that 
changed our authorities in this area has been the subject of 
numerous media reports. Let me address that issue up front. DEA 
has continued to revoke approximately 1,000 registrations each 
year through administrative tools such as orders to show cause, 
immediate suspension orders, and surrenders for cause. We have 
and will continue to use all of these tools to protect the 
public from the very small percentage of registrants who 
exploit human frailty for profit. Where a licensed revocation 
is not necessary we have aggressively pursued civil actions and 
MOUs designed to ensure compliance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Over the last decade, DEA has levied fines totaling nearly 
$390 million against opioid distributors nationwide and entered 
into MOUs with each. DEA has also reprioritized a portion of 
its criminal investigators and embedded them in with diversion 
investigators and enforcement groups, referred to as tactical 
diversion squads. We currently have 77 of these groups 
nationwide who are solely dedicated to investigating, 
disrupting, and dismantling individuals and organizations 
involved in diversion schemes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;DEA's Diversion Control Division has simultaneously worked 
to improve communication and cooperation with the registrant 
community. As an example of this outreach, DEA offers year-
round training free of charge to pharmacists, distributors, 
importers, and manufacturers. DEA just completed training more 
than 13,000 pharmacists and pharmacy technicians on the 
important role they play in ensuring they only fill valid 
prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;In May, DEA will initiate a similar nationwide effort to 
provide training on the vital role that prescribers play in 
curbing this epidemic. This effort will start with specific 
focus on States where we have seen little decrease or, in some 
increases, an increase in opioid prescribing rates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Administrative action, civil fines, and criminal cases are 
all important steps. Where we have fallen short in the past it 
is by not proactively leveraging the data that has been 
available to us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Although I am happy to discuss what happened in the past, I 
focus my time on moving our agency forward and appreciate the 
opportunity to update you on where we are today and where we 
intend to go. For example, in January we utilized ARCOS data 
overlaid with data from HHS and, when available, state PMP 
programs. The result was approximately 400 targeted leads that 
DEA was able to send to its 22 field divisions nationwide for 
further investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;We are working all the Federal agencies in the space while 
we continue to work well with our colleagues at ONDCP, CCD, 
NIDA. The mutual issues that we face today have created 
stronger and critical partnerships with FDA and HHS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I'll finish up by saying I'd like to recognize the Health 
Subcommittee's efforts to hold a legislative hearing starting 
tomorrow on more than 25 pieces of legislation. That effort not 
only underscores the unprecedented nature and complexity of the 
opioid crisis but also demonstrates that we must all take 
action to address this threat together.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Thank you for this opportunity and I look forward to your 
questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    [The prepared testimony of Mr. Patterson follows:]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Patterson. It'll now be the
opportunity for members to ask you questions regarding your 
statement and look for solutions to the problems that we have 
and I will begin by recognizing myself for 5 minutes for 
questioning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Over the past year, this committee has been investigating 
opioid dumping and as part of this probe the Committee found 
some disturbing examples, and I will share a couple of these, 
some that we have touched on. A single pharmacy in Mount Gay-
Shamrock, West Virginia, population 1,779, received over 16.5 
million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills between 2006 and 2016. 
Distributors sent 20.8 million opioid pills to Williamson, West 
Virginia, population 2,900, during the same period, and in 2006 
a pharmacy located in Kermit, West Virginia, population 406, 
ranked 22nd in the entire country in the overall number of 
hydrocodone pills it received with a single distributor 
supplying 76 percent of hydrocodone pills that year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Would you agree that, on its face, these distribution 
figures represent inordinate amounts of opioids shipped to such 
rural markets?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Distributors are required to file reports of
shipment amounts on certain controlled substances to the DEA 
database called the Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering 
System, or ARCOS. These reports are filed monthly. Is that 
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, either monthly or quarterly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; What's the distinction between when one is done
quarterly or monthly? Who makes that determination?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; It is done by a distributor or a
manufacturer.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; OK. Ten years ago, would the ARCOS database
have been able to flag DEA diversion investigators about 
unusual patterns such as the stunning monthly increases of 
shipment amounts or disproportionate volume of controlled 
substance sales at a pharmacy?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Ten years ago, I think that would be
doubtful.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; OK. Did the DEA attempt to leverage the data in
ARCOS to help support DEA investigations of opioid diversion in 
West Virginia?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Back at that time frame?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Just tell me when. When did they start
utilizing that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, so ARCOS data I think pre probably 2010
was an extremely manual process. As that system has gotten more 
robust and, certainly, through the last handful of years we've 
used that in a much more proactive manner.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Would the DEA ARCOS database be able to flag
such signals of opioid diversion today? Your answer is, 
obviously, a yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;In 2006 and 2007, DEA sent at least three letters to 
wholesale drug distributors regarding their compliance 
obligations under the Controlled Substances Act. The letters 
reminded the companies of their duties to monitor and report 
suspicious orders of opioids. Yet, during this time, according 
to DEA enforcement actions, drug distributors failed to 
maintain effective controls against diversion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Why did the DEA communications with industry fail to 
prevent the kinds of major breakdowns apparent in West 
Virginia?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I think when you go back to that timeframe
on the suspicious orders reports, there were two major 
failures. One was either a lack of information contained 
therein or not filing them in this instance that they had. I 
think that started the problem, quite frankly and a lot of the 
frustration came from chasing down the registrants and 
ultimately reminding them of their responsibility in this 
regulated area.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Over the last 10 years, the DEA reached
settlements with drug distributors for failing to maintain 
effective controls against diversion of opioids or failing to 
report suspicious orders. Yet, after these settlements, drug 
distributors continued to fail to comply with the regulatory 
requirements. Why were these initial settlements not effective 
in achieving compliance from these distributors?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; And again, this goes back to the frustration
of the day, and I know that the folks that were in diversion 
back in 2010 and 2012 struggled with the fact that these MOUs 
or MOAs have been put in place with these companies and they 
blatantly violated them again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; So how is DEA utilizing ARCOS today? Is it
effective today?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So, sir, ARCOS as a stand-alone database is
a good pointer. I think, as I said in my opening statement, 
ARCOS data and what we have learned, combined with state PMP 
HHS data, gives you a much better outlier problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    In some of the cases that we have looked at, depending on 
the situation, ARCOS data would not have found those particular 
issues, right. If it's a smaller level or a single place. So 
the reality is is what we need is all of these data sets 
essentially working in conjunction with each other.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Are there movements to improve ARCOS? Is that
constantly monitored and updated and refined?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; So we are constantly working with this data
now in a very proactive way. We've joined with two state 
coalitions of states' attorneys-general to work with data 
sharing in this space, especially with the PMP data as well as 
our counterparts at HHS.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Patterson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair now recognizes the ranking member, Ms. DeGette 
from Colorado, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and I agree,
Mr. Patterson, that we do need to look forward how we can 
improve things. But I don't think we can do it without 
examining the past, and this ARCOS system is the perfect 
example.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    I want to spend a few minutes following up on what the 
chairman was asking you, my understanding is ARCOS was in place 
during this whole time period, 2006 to 2016, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And so what was happening the data was just
being reported in but nothing was really being done with it. 
Isn't that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would say it was used in a very reactive
way.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Right. So you said that a lot of times you
wouldn't have been able to tell this from ARCOS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    I am going to assume, though, if we had been analyzing this 
data we would have found the 184,000 pills per month that 
McKesson was sending to Kermit if someone had looked at it. 
Wouldn't you think so?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I do agree with that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Yes. And wouldn't you agree that in Kermit--I
think you said yes when the chairman said this--it was 2.2 
million pills in a year in Kermit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    All you'd have to do is look at that raw data and see that, 
wouldn't you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;And so really the fact--well, let me--let me
ask you another question. The Controlled Substances Act and the 
applicable regulations require the distributors to know their 
customer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;So distributors are supposed to report orders of unusual 
size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and 
orders of unusual frequency to the DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Isn't that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; It is, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; So it's not just the DEA that has a burden to
analyze the ARCOS data and to identify problems. But even 
before that, the distributors have a burden, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; The key burden is actually on the
distributor.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Right. Exactly. So do you think that if you
were McKesson Corporation and you were looking at all these 
prescriptions in Kermit, would you think they knew those 
customers?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Well, one, the obligation was there to know
their customers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Right. Do you think that you possibly could
know the customers when you're sending that many prescriptions 
in there?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I think McKesson's answer would be that they
did their part on this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Well, what's your answer?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Obviously, I think they should have done
more.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Well, I would think so. Do you think that
orders of this magnitude--2.2 million doses of hydrocodone to 
one Sav-Rite pharmacy--do you think that that's an order of an 
unusual size?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I do, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And do you think that it deviates from a
normal pattern?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;OK. Let me ask you another question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Now, looking back on this case, do you think that the 
distributors in all of these situations that the Chairman and I 
have been talking about--do you think that they failed to 
adequately exercise good due diligence over what they were 
doing?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Certainly, on the appearance of it. I can't
tell you what their due diligence was. But----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Oh, we are going to ask them that. Don't
worry. You're not here to represent them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Now, in December, the Washington Post and ``60 Minutes'' 
reported that McKesson distributed large volumes of opioids 
from its Aurora, Colorado distribution facility in 2012. One 
pharmacy that received these shipments reportedly sold as many 
as 2,000 opioids per day. Have you retroactively applied ARCOS 
data to the Colorado situation to see if there were 
distribution patterns similar to what we saw in Kermit, West 
Virginia?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I believe that's the case, ma'am, that
ultimately the DEA litigated and received a settlement. I don't 
know if we went back currently and have looked at that same 
number.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And what was the settlement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; It was $150 million.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; From McKesson to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; The U.S. government.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; The U.S. government. As a result of McKesson's
failure to adequately follow the law on distributing those 
opioids. Is that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And so what do you think Congress can do so
that we don't have a total slip-up like we did in all of these 
cases in West Virginia and around the country, really?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Well, look, the fundamental change that we
have already made is our recognition of how we can use the 
various data sets and paying attention to what we are doing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;The outreach to industry--and I think this is a topic that 
I assume will come up at some point--we have to work with the 
industry and the industry, obviously, has their responsibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    But we have 1,500 people to monitor 1.73 million 
registrants.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; So, really, you think the initial burden to
assess this is on the industry. But then the DEA has an 
important enforcement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Oversight.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Yes, thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the chairman of the full 
committee, Mr. Walden, for 5 minutes for questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Mr. Patterson, we need to find out whether DEA is really 
addressing the lessons you say DEA has learned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Case in point is the one I raised, the questionable 
enforcement approach regarding the two Sav-Rite pharmacies in 
Kermit, West Virginia that I mentioned in my opening statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Sav-Rite No. 2 was shut down in April of 2009, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I don't know the specific dates. I know
there were two pharmacies. One was shut down and one wanted 
criminal----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; Yes, our data show April of 2009 Sav-Rite 2 was
shut down. Sav-Rite 1 was not shut down until over 2 years 
later when the owner of the pharmacy entered a guilty plea to 
charges that he illegally issued prescriptions, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And in April 1st of 2009, an article in the
local Herald Dispatch reported that the two Sav-Rite pharmacies 
and a local pain clinic were under federal investigation for 
operating a drug operation. The article reported an affidavit 
from Federal investigators who stated there were two overdose 
deaths linked to this network.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    So my question is why did DEA shut down Sav-Rite No. 2 but 
not Sav-Rite No. 1 in April of 2009 if both pharmacies were 
part of a network linked to deaths?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, I would have to get back to you on that
one particular issue and I will you the reason why. It's my 
understanding it was part of the criminal process in that case 
and I don't know the answer for why that was. But I would be 
happy to get that back to you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    So why would the DEA even consider such an arrangement when 
it knew the owner operated the pharmacies 2 miles apart, one of 
which the DEA claimed to be the prime reception location for 
the flood of pills--that's a direct quote--being sent to the 
area and linked to overdose deaths? Same owner, same operator, 
2 miles apart?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I agree with you, and it's something I will
get back to you on.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; During the time the DEA allowed Sav-Rite No. 1
to remain in operation, this pharmacy received somewhere 
between 1 and 2 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills. 
Allowing Sav-Rite 1 to continue to dispense such a volume of 
opioids posed a continuing risk to public health and safety. 
Isn't that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would agree.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; So, Mr. Patterson, what's the biggest priority?
Protecting public safety or deferring to an ongoing criminal 
investigation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; It should have been to protect public
safety.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So in this case, the government originally
entered a plea agreement with the pharmacy owner that didn't 
even call for any prison time. The lack of any prison time 
troubled the judge and eventually the defendant was sentenced 
to 6 months in prison.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    What kinds of evidentiary challenges would have been 
involved in such a case and would putting an immediate 
suspension order on hold really help solve these challenges?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So putting an immediate suspension order on
hold, again, I don't know the particular facts of that criminal 
case and I would be happy to get back to you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    I will tell you that I have a very strong opinion and this 
has been relayed throughout our agency that whether it's an 
immediate suspension or whether a surrender for cause, that if 
we are having harm issues that that suspension needs to occur 
even in lieu of a criminal prosecution.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; And have you gone back and looked? Are there
any records in your possession that would speak to this issue 
of why that decision was made?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would be happy to go back and look, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; And will you provide those to us unredacted?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would be happy to take that back and take
a look at it for you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; That wasn't the answer I was looking for.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I don't want to commit to the department's
files. But I would be happy to take that back and I will take 
your concern back about getting them unredacted.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Yes. We've had this discussion in private.
We'll have it in public. We'll have it in private.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;The long and short of it is we just want to find out what 
was going on, what was the thinking, why the change in 
operation. People died and things were not--we don't want to 
see your agency repeat that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    We are beholden to the constituents we represent and I 
think the public has a right to know, don't you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I fully understand your concern and I agree
with you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; Would this happen again today?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Certainly, I think with our mentality, the
answer would be no. Like I said, what we wish to do, sir, is 
stop public harm. I've had this conversation with U.S. 
attorneys' population, states' attorneys' population.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    I see in too many instances on ISOs, current ones that I 
sign off on, where there has been a delay that I don't find 
appropriate.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; So how do you weigh when to proceed with an ISO
versus a criminal case?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I would take it, quite frankly, no different
than what we would do in a criminal case in the field, and in 
this case, I find that we have the ability.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    So we have certain protocols where we evaluate risk of 
ongoing criminal activity in traditional criminal cases. In 
this case, because the person has a registration, we can 
immediately stop that harm.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; And what's immediate? Is that 90 days? Twenty-
five days? Tomorrow?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I think the frustration in this is it takes
time to build even that ISO charge, which is the reason why, in 
a lot of cases, we've gone to surrenders for cause or a 
voluntary surrender in which we go in and try and remove that 
registration.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; So how long are we talking about to build that
case?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I think probably, in an efficient manner, 45
to 90 days.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; So during that period, they can continue to
dispense these drugs?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;The same way an illicit person would be out
on the street as we gather the evidence we needed to present 
the charge.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    That's why, sir, I go back to my point on surrender for 
cause, or a voluntary surrender. If I can walk in and lay out 
to that person why they need to surrender that and I can do it 
in a day and that's the method that we have actually been using 
much more aggressively than the ISO process, then we are going 
to do that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; What's the average time to go to a voluntary
surrender?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;It depends. With very aggressive people it
happens relatively quickly. There's always a quick balance with 
a criminal case and then evidence that they need to look at for 
that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    And, like I said, again, our conversations with prosecutors 
in the field have been that decision has to get made quickly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;All right. I know my time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;I would imagine Mr. Griffith is going to have a comment or 
two on this as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back, and thank you again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the full 
committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Mr. Patterson, I want to ask you about another pharmacy in 
West Virginia so I can better understand why DEA was not able 
to stop the distributors from oversupplying certain pharmacies. 
This one is the Family Discount Pharmacy in Mount Gay-Shamrock, 
West Virginia. Mount Gay-Shamrock has a population of just 
under 2,000. DEA's data shows that distributors shipped 16.5 
million opioid pills to this pharmacy between 2006 and 2016, 
including 2 million pills in three consecutive years. By 
contrast, the Rite-Aid Pharmacy down the street received a 
total of about 2 million pills during this entire 11-year 
period.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    So do you agree that over 16 million pills is an excessive 
amount of opioids for Family Discount Pharmacy to have received 
relative to the size of the town it served?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Especially when you compare it to the other
pharmacy. Correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;One distributor has provided evidence suggesting that 
between May 2008 and May 2009 they sent DEA 105 suspicious 
order reports stating that this pharmacy regularly ordered high 
volumes of pills.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;For example, this distributor apparently told DEA that 
Family Discount ordered 25 500-count hydrocodone bottles on 
June 16th, 2008, and that's 12,500 pills just in the one day. 
On October 10th, Family Discount ordered 32 500-count 
hydrocodone bottles, or 16,000 pills in a single day, again, 
for a town of only 2,000 people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    Now, merely reporting these suspicious orders does not 
absolve the distributor of its additional responsibilities. Is 
that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt; So distributors still have to actually refuse
shipments to suspicious pharmacies?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; They can, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Additionally, it appears that distributors
continue to ship this pharmacy over a million opioid pills each 
year in the 5 years after these reports were made and even the 
distributor who told us they reported the pharmacy to DEA 
continued to supply them after submitting those reports.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    So, Mr. Patterson, it would appear that, again, something 
broke down to allow so many opioids to be shipped to this 
pharmacy. Just tell us what happened here. Why are so many 
opioids sent to this pharmacy at the same time that DEA has 
received a number of suspicious order reports? What do you 
think happened?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Sir, so, again, on any of these
individualized cases I am going to have to go back and take a 
look at the specific instances of what happened.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I will give you, I think, the concern I have with the 
ARCOS--not just ARCOS data but the suspicious orders, which is 
that was a decentralized function. It would go out to our 
division--those reports.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    We are now bringing those in as well to our headquarters 
for proper deconfliction and visibility of what we see. I will 
take on face value the facts that you just proffered to me and 
I would be happy to go back and take a look at the Family 
Discount scenario. As I sit here, I don't have the particulars 
on the case from that time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Well, we appreciate your following up. That's
obviously why we are asking the questions. I don't expect you 
to know everything right off the bat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    But let me just say this. Between 2006 and 2010, did the 
DEA have any data analysts assigned to scrutinize information 
from distributors about the amount of pills shipped to 
particular pharmacies? Did you have any kind of data analysts, 
in that respect?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So my understanding of the people that were
handling the ARCOS data it was a completely manual process, 
meaning everything was coming in on paper or tapes, which would 
have to be verified.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    So you have this 1-month to 3-month delay to begin with. 
They would have to have errors in their report that would go 
back and forth. So what you found yourself with is a set of 
data that sometimes would take a year-plus to get correct, and 
then in that timeframe, sir, we are using it very much as a 
reactive tool. In other words, someone would come in and 
provide some piece of information on a pharmacy or a doctor or 
some other issue and then they would go and look at the ARCOS 
data. It was not done in a----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt; So does that mean then, if I understand you,
that it would be too long a period of time before would they 
realize how excessive this was?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Well, if it was still ongoing, obviously, it
would be an ability to look at that current situation. In a lot 
of these cases you see where these problems occurred for either 
a year or two and then disappeared or they were ongoing. But--
--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt; And is that problem being corrected or what do
you suggest we do?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; It has been corrected, sir. So, again, I
think that for the Committee to understand is ARCOS is an 
extremely different tool in 2018 than it was even in 2010 or 
2011.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt; So you feel that you already have the tools to
correct it--you don't need anything else?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I feel that tool, with other data, is an
important way for us to look proactively at the very specific 
issues that we are talking about today.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt; All right. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. 
Barton, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;This is a difficult hearing because I think everybody has 
the same bottom line. But your agency doesn't appear to be 
willing to aggressively try to help us solve this or at least 
deal with this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;According to the latest numbers that this committee staff 
has, 115 people a day are dying of opioid overdoses and two-
thirds of those are legally prescribed drugs. So about 80 
people a day are dying from taking legally-prescribed 
prescription drugs. Now, they may be getting that prescription 
in an illegal way--in other words, they don't really need it. 
You're the head of the agency that's supposed to do something 
about it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Now, I don't know much about you but, apparently, your 
background has been on the illegal side of DEA. Is that 
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That is correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; OK. How long have you been in your current
position?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Since October of 2017.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; OK. And I doubt that you volunteered for the
job. We still don't have a Trump administration appointee who's 
been recommended to the Senate. So for the foreseeable future 
in terms of drug enforcement the buck stops with you, even 
though you're, as I understand it, a career civil servant. Is 
that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; OK. Are you familiar with the Washington Post
articles that have been running the last 3 to 4 months? One of 
them talks about the tension between the field enforcement 
offices and the Washington administrative officials.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I have.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; OK. Do you agree or disagree with the basic
thrust of those articles--that the enforcement people were very 
enthusiastic and willing to really go after the distribution 
centers and the drug manufacturers and the pharmacies and the 
Washington staff, for lack of a better term, stonewalled them 
or toned them down?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; So I believe that's an overstatement. I
think you have a number of issues that, quite frankly, play out 
in this space, some of which have to do with personalities. But 
I don't find that the folks in the field, for the most part, 
had this belief that they were shut down. I do think there were 
people that felt that way at headquarters but not necessarily 
in the field.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Are you familiar with a gentleman named
Clifford Lee Reeves, II?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; You don't think he stonewalled them or toned
them down?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, as I've talked about with everybody
I've met on this situation, I will simply explain this. I could 
put three people in a room and talk about probable cause and 
they could all have different opinions on----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Well, let me put it this way. You and your
associates in Washington have stonewalled this committee for 
the last 6 or 7 months.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;It took a threat of Chairman Walden to subpoena the 
attorney general of the United States to finally break loose 
some documents. We didn't get those documents, I understand, 
until yesterday. Now, that's not the Washington Post, sir. 
That's your people in Washington interacting with Energy and 
Commerce Committee staff on a bipartisan basis. That's not 
hypothetical. That's real.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Now, we are as much a part of the problem as anybody 
because the Congress has not aggressively addressed it. But we 
are beginning to, and as long as you're the head of the DEA, I 
personally, as Vice Chairman of this committee, expect you to 
work with us and to tell your people to work with the committee 
staff. Can you do that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, I took over this job in October. I met
with----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; OK. I want to know will you do what I just
asked you to do? Yes or no. Will you tell your people to work 
with committee staff to help address this problem?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Of course, and I have since November and
we've been turning documents over since that time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Well, you didn't turn them over until
yesterday, sir, and some of the documents you turned over were 
so redacted that it just looked like black marks on the pages.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, we've been turning documents over since
November to the tune of more than 10,000 pages of documents 
that have come over here in the last month.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Yes, and how many of those pages do you think
are useable?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Well, we sat down yesterday with staff to
go----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Because this hearing was today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Mr. Patterson [continuing]. The concerns. Sir, I would 
respectfully disagree with that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Well, at least you're respectfully disagreeing
and I appreciate that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I am fully committed, sir, to working with
this committee and being as transparent as I can be.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Well, you just remember, 80 people a day are
dying because of legal prescription drugs that are probably 
being illegally prescribed. Remember that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the gentlewoman from Florida, 
Ms. Castor, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Harper.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Administrator Patterson, I am sure you know about the 
multi-district opioid litigation in the Northern District of 
Ohio, which consolidates over 400 lawsuits brought by cities 
and counties and other states' communities against the drug 
distributors, manufacturers, and pharmacy chains. The most 
important source of information in that major lawsuit is going 
to be most likely the ARCOS data, and I understand DEA 
initially resisted providing ARCOS data to the federal judge.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;A DEA official testified in response to my question in the 
Health Subcommittee hearing last month that the resistance was 
based upon a need to protect proprietary information. But now 
the court in this case has recently entered a protective order 
describing how the parties should treat the confidential ARCOS 
data when DEA disclosed it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    It's apparent to me that the ARCOS data will be pivotal in 
appropriately resolving the case and assigning accountability. 
Do I understand now that DEA has agreed to provide 9 years of 
data on opioid sales including the identifies of manufacturers 
and distributors that sold 95 percent of opioids in every State 
from 2006 to 2014?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That is correct, under the protective order.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; Under the protective order. So this will not be
the last major challenge to manufacturers and distributors and 
others that are responsible. Will DEA likely cooperate in those 
cases too? Have you set up a standard--is this a decision, 
going forward, that other judges and litigants can count on?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would believe it's under the same
circumstances and conditions that we would comply the same way 
with anyone else that came in under those same terms.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; So when will that data be provided to the
Federal court in the northern Ohio case?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I can get back to you on the date. I think
it's very short term.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;OK. The Committee's analysis of ARCOS data has
been very concerning. The trends in West Virginia--we've just 
really skimmed the surface, I think.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;My colleagues have outlined some of these. I am concerned 
that there are other regions all across the country where 
distributors may have supplied pharmacies with excessive 
quantities of opioid pills and that that information may be 
overlooked.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    How is DEA currently using the older ARCOS data, say, from 
2006 to the present to go back and look at past crimes, and if 
you could explain what you're doing now.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;No, I appreciate the question and I think
it's an important issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So the 400 packages that we just put out are current-day 
packages that we want to investigate--in other words, where 
harm is continuing. I shouldn't say where harm is definitely 
continuing but where those outliers are that we want to go back 
and take a look at, why is that occurring, right?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Some of these actually end up being reasonable issues. 
There's an oncology department there. There's some reason why 
there's a higher level of that medication going to that area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I think the key is is that once we get a handle on current 
issues that we are dealing with we want to roll backwards and 
look at 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 where we still have the 
ability to take a look at that data and make it make sense.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    I can tell you that there's a number of cases ongoing in 
DEA without going into detail on them, looking at just that 
issue right now with manufacturers and----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;And what is the statute of limitations? If you
go back and the Committee has seen some of this in graphical 
forms where 2006 it ramped up and then because now the 
spotlight is being shined on it that the excessive distribution 
has scaled down.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    Do you have the ability to go back and hold them 
accountable for that peak dangerous distribution of opioids?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; So on the criminal side, I believe it would
be 5 years. On civil, I would have to find out. I am not sure 
how far back you can go civilly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; So you are----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; As long as it is an ongoing issue, then you
fall into that timeframe.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; And there was a lot of criticism by the
Pulitzer Prize-winning Charleston Gazette Mail that the state 
didn't take advantage of data at their fingertips. How are you 
cooperating with states in providing that data so they can hold 
folks accountable?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So this gets back to the issue, I think,
with PMP which--and this is why these two data sets are so 
critical with each other.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;We see the distribution to the pharmacy. PMP data in the 
states will then show you the distribution out of the pharmacy, 
right. So that whole connection, that's where those other 
outliers become very critical for us to take a look at.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Some states, and this is the issue that we have addressed 
throughout the members that we've met through and the states 
that we've talked to, some states share this data. Some states 
require a subpoena, which is also fine. Some states don't 
share. This is a problem that we have and, frankly, I think an 
issue that I would hope that someone looks at on a legislative 
fix, at a minimum to make the states cooperate with each other 
because you have bordering states, in some cases, that are 
still not participating and cooperating with each other, which 
is exactly how a lot of this diversion happens.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; Thank you very much. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Before we proceed, I want to clarify for the record that 
the DEA has been producing documents and the vast majority of 
the roughly 9,700 pages we have received have come in during 
the last month.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Those documents had substantial redactions. Staff 
identified key documents for you and yesterday the DEA brought 
up some of those for us to view in camera. And I will note that 
those documents still contain some redactions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    So there's still much work to be done. I wanted to clarify 
that for the record, that the bulk of these came in after 
Chairman Walden's press conference and we'll continue to work 
with you in this effort.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Thank you, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Now the chair will recognize the Vice Chairman
of the Subcommittee, the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Griffith, 
for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Mr. Patterson, I am going to need your assistance on some 
of this because what I am going to do is ask a series of 
questions which require a yes or no answer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    First, if you would take a look at the email before you 
dated 5/6/2011. I show it to you here, and I would ask 
unanimous consent to put that into the record.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Without objection.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; And apparently, secret DEA official wrote,
because his name is blacked out, our first and most prominent 
social responsibility as government officials in the DEA is to 
protect the public. I think that trumps all other activities. I 
think that's what Congress/citizens would expect us to do. You 
agree with that statement, don't you? Yes or no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;One of the key tools for DEA to fulfill this
mission is through an immediate suspension order--I will 
henceforth refer to those as ISOs. This is an administrative 
tool used as an emergency intervention to stop a rogue doctor 
or pharmacist from continuing to prescribe or dispense opioids 
that would possibly kill drug seekers and/or put the public at 
risk.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    You agree with that as well, don't you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; An essential element for requesting the ISO
is concern about imminent danger to public health or safety. A 
pharmacy in Oviedo, Florida received an increase of oxycodone 
of almost 2,500 percent compared to 1 year earlier. Local 
police arrested customers in the parking lot of this pharmacy 
for selling/trading pills. Police officers were concerned 
customers were getting high in the parking lot and getting on 
the roads, endangering the public. The continued dispensing of 
opioids by this pharmacy with its parking lot of drug pushers 
and drug users who get high and then drive on the public roads 
would pose an imminent danger to the public, wouldn't you 
agree? Yes or no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; You would also agree, I assume, that speed is
crucial in issuing imminent suspension orders to protect the 
public? Yes or no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; I will just tell you, 45 to 90 days that you
told the Chairman of the Full Committee is not acceptable. 
Please refer to another email before you and I ask unanimous 
consent to put that in the record and this one is dated August 
22nd--or 20th--there's two different dates on it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Without objection.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;2013.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;All right. The email chain in August 2013 shows that DEA 
lawyers were requiring the DEA field to submit an expert 
witness report to describe the expert's assessment of data and 
documents prior to submitting either or both request for an 
immediate suspension order and orders to show cause.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Are you aware of this new requirement that was imposed in 
2013? Yes or no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; No.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;And I expected that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Regarding medical experts being required, DEA counsel Lee 
Reeves wrote, ``To be clear, this is not a chief counsel office 
requirement policy. This is the requirement of the 
administrator and the courts.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Are you aware that the medical experts are required by the 
DEA administrator? Yes or no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; No.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Mr. Reeves also wrote that as a general
matter, these cases without expert testimony are the exception 
rather than the rule.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    So, generally, DEA is requiring medical expert testimony 
before the field can submit an ISO to the chief counsel's 
office for review. Is this still the policy of the DEA? Yes or 
no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; It is not a policy, no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I appreciate that. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Mr. Reeves cites the DEA administrator's decision in the 
Ruben case for requiring medical experts. However, the Ruben 
case is a show cause case, not an ISO.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    This decision basically says that if a state doesn't 
provide guidance on certain medical standards, the DEA must use 
an expert to explain why the doctor's activities fell below the 
standard of care. However, you would not need a medical expert 
if the state had a statute of regulations on prescribing 
standards. Yes or no, or I don't know?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I don't know that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;All right. Fair enough.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Let's discuss this policy of requiring experts, and I know 
that you're trying to shift from some of that but let's discuss 
it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    It would take some time for the DEA field to find a medical 
expert, wouldn't you agree?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; And to obtain the services of a medical
expert the DEA would have to issue a sole source contract and 
the agency and the expert would have to figure out and reach an 
agreement on fee and deliverables. Isn't that true?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I don't necessarily know about the contract
but it would require some type of compensation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; And after all of that, the medical expert
would need to review prescription monitoring program, data 
patient files, and other information. It's going to take some 
time for the medical expert to review and render an opinion, 
isn't it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; It would.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; Yes. After the medical expert completes the
review then the chief counsel's office would need additional 
time to review the field submission of the request for an 
immediate suspension order. Isn't that true?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; This scenario assumes no delays along the
way, and realistically this process, in many ISO cases, will 
take weeks, won't it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would believe so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; And that's where you get your 45 to 90 days.
If the DEA registrant sought a restraining order against the 
ISO, the delay in timing getting the medical expert and going 
through all the steps we just went through would in fact weaken 
the DEA's case in court for immediacy, wouldn't it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would believe so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Yes, it would.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    And so in fact, insisting on an expert medical testimony 
for the ISO--I get the trial in cheap, the merits. But to 
protect the public, insistent on a medical expert in advance is 
endangering the public and endangering your case on the ISO 
because it takes away the immediacy factor. Wouldn't you agree?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes, and I----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;OK. I got to keep moving because I am already
out of time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    All right. Maybe I can get some more opportunity later. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Gentleman yields back. The chair will now
recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Ruiz, for 5 
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;Mr. Patterson, thank you for coming. I am a
board-certified emergency physician and I can't tell you how 
personally I take it whenever a patient comes in overdosed, not 
breathing, and blue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;It's not uncommon to see a blue-colored patient being 
strolled in in an emergency situation, having been dumped from 
a car from friends who found this person overdosed, not 
breathing. And as emergency physicians we cut to the chase and 
we start resuscitating the patient. We know exactly what to do 
no matter if it's from overdose of opiates or any other reason 
why a patient is comatose. Whether we start the ABCs--airway 
breathing circulations--and we bring them back, as much as 
possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;So I am going to cut to the chase here and ask you to be 
very frank and direct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;You screwed up. The DEA knew that there was a lot of 
opioids being shipped, an extraordinary amount and not 
outliers, and when you said earlier that there's two things 
that you were going to do from now on it's very concerning that 
those two things were to recognize how to use the data, and 
two, pay more attention to what you're doing. That leads me to 
believe that you were collecting data that you did not know how 
to use, and two, you weren't paying attention to your job 
within the DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;    So I am going to be very straightforward. What are you 
doing different now that you're going to recognize how to use 
the data?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, I appreciate the concern and I think
what I've tried to explain is the data--when we are talking 
about a lot of these cases that you have brought up we are 
talking about a time period in which this data was----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; OK. Be specific on what are the changes you're
going to do now. Not giving me the reasons why or an excuse. 
Tell me what are you going to do now that's different.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; So let me give you a handful of the
differences.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;On the suspicious orders, we have
regulations that are in the final stretch to deal with that. We 
have a website that's now been built for the distributors to 
understand their customers better where they can go in and see 
partial information on other people that distributed to that 
particular pharmacy for the past 6 months.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    We are working with all of our other partners both in the 
Health and Human Services side and the states to try and 
combine all this data, to look at it in a very proactive 
manner.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; What are your flags? What numerical equations
have you used to flag something for the pharmacies and for the 
distributors?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would have to get you what the specific
flags are for them. I mean, they----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; Are they new flags or are they old flags, like--
--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;No, they're our baselines for any given area
as to traditional, what the prescribing rates have been in 
those particular areas and anything that's an anomaly to that 
is a flag.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    All right. So when we've talked about these issues before 
we have a----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; And who's looking at those flags? Who's the one
in your department who's actually putting their eyes on this 
computer and reporting these?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; A unit within the diversion.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; OK. And how many people are in that unit?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would have to get that number for you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; OK, because you have----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Again, most of it's generated by computer.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; So it's not necessarily a manpower-intensive
endeavor to do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; OK. And so when you said that now you're going to
start paying attention to what you're doing, tell me about 
that. What are the organizational changes that you have made to 
start paying attention to doing your job?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I don't think I said now that we are doing
it. I think we've been doing it for a period of time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;Well, you said moving forward that now, what you
have to do is to pay attention to what you're doing. That means 
to imply that there was some kind of slip-up before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;    So what exactly are you doing? What are the changes? I want 
to practice my ABCs for a patient who's coming in. I want to 
know what you're doing exactly that you're going to make sure 
that this doesn't happen again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Again, that's some of the issues I just
talked to you about and how we use data, or not community 
outreach. Well, community outreach with the prescribing----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;Have you changed any organizational structure? Is
there any accountability metrics that you have included in your 
department? Have you increased the staffing in certain areas?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;    What are you doing to pay better attention to your job?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Over the past few years, we've increased
staffing and diversion. We have a new head of diversion control 
coming in. He and I have sat down and spent time on this 
particular issue as to other proactive ways we can look at it. 
I met with the U.S. attorney and states' attorneys to talk 
about these issues of working criminal cases or civil cases and 
how they impact our administrative issues for the criminal 
prosecutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    They want to continue to gather evidence. If we have some 
harm that's being done and we can stop it, then we have to 
start to balance this out in a better and more proactive way. 
So there are dozens of things we are doing differently. This is 
not just a one issue fix.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; Well, those are the things that I am particularly
concerned and want to know more about because that's what's 
going to create the change is by making changes in your 
department in order to use your data more efficiently and also 
to start paying attention whether it's through computers or 
personnel, because a computer can flag all it wants to flag but 
if a human is not taking those warnings and having action based 
on what your computer is flagging then it's just going to be a 
flashing flagging computer.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Understood.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Dr. 
Burgess, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And Mr. Patterson, I want to acknowledge that I asked for 
you to come to my office and you complied with that, and for 
that I am deeply appreciative with the information that you 
shared with me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Obviously, this is something about which many of us feel 
very, very strongly. Clearly, we want to get some answers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    The subcommittee has interest in knowing about differences 
between voluntary suspension orders and immediate suspension 
orders. I will stipulate that both exist and that we could 
argue which is a more propitious path to follow. Are there 
other tools you have in your tool box in addition to immediate 
suspension order and the voluntary suspension order?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sure. There's a whole range. There's letters
of admonition, orders to show cause. There's a host of 
administrative tools that we have that we can use in this 
space, and depending on--and to go back to an issue that Mr. 
Griffith had brought up, depending on, quite frankly, whether 
it's a doctor or a pharmacy may be a very different reaction 
than what we would do or evidence we would gather against maybe 
a distributor.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Let me ask you a question, because I can't
take credit for it--my staff did this--but went to your 
Diversion Control Division and pulled down a document that's 
called ``Cases Against Doctors'' and this is produced by the 
U.S. Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    I presume it's your product. It's about a hundred pages 
long. It goes back, basically, to 2002 through October 12th of 
2017. It's a hundred pages or about three cases per page, so 
that's 300 cases against doctors in the last 15 years. Does 
that sound about right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, I don't know. That's a complete list of
all doctors that cases have been worked or is it a guide to 
help people and where people have gotten into trouble?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Well, I will tell you what concerns me as I
look through this is that most of the dates are pre-2009. So I 
guess my question would be where is the data from 2010 onward 
and perhaps that's something we can follow up with together 
because I do share the provider's perspective on this. We want 
to be able to provide pain relief when it's required of us and 
it's appropriate.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;At the same time, we obviously do not want to be 
jeopardizing public safety and the integrity of society the way 
the opiate crisis is endangering us currently. But I think this 
could be very important information. You referenced, at the 
start of your testimony, that over-prescribing is perhaps one 
of the number-one problems. Well, if that's the case, then it's 
this sort of information that is, I think, going to be very 
helpful to us as policy makers how do we develop the correct 
policy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Let me just ask you, did I understand this figure 
correctly? You referenced $309 million in fines at the DEA 
level. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; In civil fines, $390 million or $309
million.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;So OK, that ballpark--$300 to $400 million.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;We'd appropriated a billion dollars in cures for treatment 
of this problem. We are looking at another $6 billion in the 
appropriations bills that are coming through right now. So you 
see the disparity there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Someone, whether it be suppliers, prescribers is causing a 
problem to exist. You're finding them but it's only minuscule 
compared with the amount that it's actually costing society in 
trying to save people, salvage people, get people back to 
productivity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    That doesn't even address the fact that, again, people are 
taken out of being productive citizens when they enter into 
this type of behavior. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I agree, sir. And may I just add? So these
fines come as, again, and some of the members have already 
mentioned this balance, right, of ensuring pain medicines for 
people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    So I think the fines generally come with, quite frankly, 
the heavier piece of that is the memoranda of understanding or 
memoranda of agreement of how they'll behave, moving forward.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Correct. I get that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Let me just ask you this, because I think it was Mr. Barton 
referenced 80 people a day who were dying--115 was the total 
number but 80 per day are dying because of what you described 
as over-prescribing. And then we've got these lists that in my 
observation are not up to date. Do we know how many people were 
dying a day from over-prescribing in 2007, 2008, 2009 in that 
timeframe? Do you have a figure?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I don't have it here. I would be happy to
get that stat for you. It still was an alarming number, even 
back in that time period, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And then that begs the question. And again, I
appreciate the effort that you're putting into it now. But it's 
been right there in front of us for well over a decade, decade 
and a half and, clearly, it requires all hands on deck in our 
approach. And, again, I appreciate your being very forthcoming 
with my office and I appreciate that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I will yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the gentlewoman from New York, 
Ms. Clarke, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our
ranking member.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;Mr. Patterson, it's clear in many cases certain drug 
distributors supply very large volumes of opioids to some 
pharmacies in West Virginia. But we've also seen from DEA's 
data that many of these pharmacies were buying from multiple 
distributors. For example, in 2009, the West Virginia pharmacy, 
Hurley Drug, received over 2 million opioid pills from six 
different distributors, including over 300,000 from one 
distributor, over 600,000 from a second distributor, and over 
900,000 from a third.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;So it's bad enough if one distributor over-supplies a 
pharmacy. But when you look at the total shipments that Hurley 
Drug received from all distributors, it was about 2 million 
pills, which is over seven times what a similar pharmacy will 
be expected to receive, according to DEA's own data.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;    So DEA is the only entity that can see the volumes that 
multiple distributors are simultaneously sending to a single 
pharmacy. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; From the distributor level, yes, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt; So, Mr. Patterson, was DEA performing analytics
a decade ago to identify these kinds of patterns at individual 
pharmacies?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Again, ma'am, in a reactive manner at that
time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;OK. So I would like to look at DEA's data on
another pharmacy in West Virginia--Sav-Rite Pharmacy in the 
small town of Kermit received hydrocodone from five different 
distributors in 2008. A few distributors provided relatively 
normal amounts that don't seem to raise alarms. However, one 
distributor shipped 1.2 million pills and another shipped 
nearly 2 million. All told this pharmacy got nearly 4 million 
pills that year, which is nearly 15 times what a similar 
pharmacy would be expected to receive, according to DEA's data.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;    Mr. Patterson, if you rely on distributors to report 
suspicious orders from pharmacies, how do you flag pharmacies 
trying to stay under the radar by buying from multiple 
distributors?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So, ma'am, this is where, again, the data
that we use today--not the data, I shouldn't say the data--but 
how we use the data is very different today, and this is also 
where the critical nature comes into us working with the 
states.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Those same pharmacies, that PMP data which show that amount 
of distribution from those pharmacies, so we have that 
distributor in and then the pharmacy out, depending on the PMP 
program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So the key is for us to work together on that and, again, I 
can say repeatedly in 2008, 2009, and 2010 we did not use this 
data in the way that we are now using it and I think that's the 
key.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    I get that we have this issue from a decade ago, that we 
have to resolve in terms of how we used it. And, again, where 
we fell short in that we'll take responsibility for it. I think 
the system is much more robust and used in a much different way 
in----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt; So can you give us a little bit more insight
into how you're proactively analyzing the data to ensure that 
pharmacies are not being over supplied by multiple 
distributors? That has not come across clearly to us this 
morning. How are you actually doing that disruption?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Again, so as we talked about in the opening,
we are proactively looking at data not just across DEA and that 
ARCOS database that we've talked about but HHS, PMP programs 
where we are sharing that information and looking to 
proactively target outliers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt; So what happens once you're flagged in this
regard?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; So we----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt; What exactly happens?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; We send that information out to the field
for investigators--those TDS groups or diversion groups, 
depending on how they're being used to go out and work those 
cases to find out is it a legitimate amount of prescriptions 
that are going there or is there illegitimate diversion 
occurring in those areas.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt; And has that worked thus far? Because, you said
this was over a decade ago. I am assuming that you have already 
begun sort of this new protocol. What are your findings?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Yes, ma'am. So the interesting thing is of
those 400 packages that went out, a good majority of what we 
saw in that data and the outliers and what they identified were 
ongoing cases that we already had, which shows that that data 
set works to develop and target those areas where we have 
problems.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    To the extent that we didn't have cases on those other ones 
and they were warranted, we've opened cases on those facilities 
or doctors or distributors to take a look at that behavior.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;Mr. Patterson, I just want to share with you
that this is an ongoing crisis. Once we are able to disrupt 
this supply chain, we know that these supply chains become 
supplanted by more nefarious actors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt;    And so, I really want to impress upon you and your agency 
to be as forward leaning in this regard as possible because 
once those pills are cut off, we know that that's when the 
illicit trade picks up in velocity.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes, ma'am. And as we've talked about,
again, in the opening, I think that shift has already occurred.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Clarke&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Ms. Clarke"&gt; Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Gentlewoman yields back. The chair will now
recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Collins, for 5 
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr.
Patterson for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;I think you can tell and your get out of jail free card 
today, you have been in this particular job 5 months. I would 
hope 5 months from now you would not be giving many of the same 
answers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;Following up on what Mr. Ruiz said, I think we are just all 
frustrated. There seems to be the bureaucracy mindset in the 
DEA today, much like we've seen in the VA. And we are finally 
seeing heads rolling in the VA. Not as fast as we want. I am 
just curious, because there's no doubt there was an abject 
failure of the DEA, going back the last 10 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;    Have a lot of heads been chopped off? Have you got a new 
team in place?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, so as I said, we have a new head of
Diversion Control. I think the last two people that have done 
that job have done and both successful in turning around that 
program.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;Well, not to interrupt but to interrupt, I
think the right people can turn this around in 48 hours. I am a 
turn around guy. That's what I've spent my whole life doing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;You bring a new team in and people get called in the office 
every day and they walk out saying, somebody just hit me up the 
side of the head with a baseball bat. I am either going to get 
my act together or I am going to get out of Dodge.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;This isn't a time to be polite or nice or let's do better 
tomorrow. No, this is an abject failure, and if I am sitting in 
that seat and McKesson processed 1.6 million orders and only 16 
were deemed suspicious, that's absurd. I don't know what kind 
of computers you have but that's absurd. It means no one was 
watching.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;And you can say well, that was being done in the district 
level. But it's indefensible. When we look in West Virginia and 
two suspicious orders so, let's maybe jump ahead, and in 2008, 
Cardinal Health was fined $34 million for not reporting 
suspicious orders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;All right. So let's go forward 8 years later. They're still 
not doing it. Two guesses. First--second one doesn't count. How 
much do you think you fined them 8 years later for the same 
problem? Thirty-four million dollars, the same amount. In most 
places the second offense--all right, first offense $34 
million, eight years later the same problem, the same fine? 
Should have been tenfold. Should have been $340 million 
dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;What did your agency do? And this was a year and a half 
ago. You guys don't get it and if you're not--this committee 
agrees on a lot. I don't think we've ever agreed across the 
board on an issue as much as we are agreeing your agency needs 
to be turned upside down, not just a little shakeup here and 
there but turned upside down. It starts with you. If you can't 
do it, you ought to get out.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;So when I look at some of the things--so we have 
distributors. We have pharmacies. We have doctors. Well, I 
happen to live next door--literally, next door to one of the 
doctors, Dr. Gosy, in Clarence, New York, and I saw his six 
sports cars parked out there with all new--his name in the 
community was Dr. Pain. And this wasn't something new.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;When I look back, it took the DEA a good 7 years to come 
after my next door neighbor. By the way, he doesn't live there 
anymore. But he had set up a script line in 2012 where people 
could call in and fill scripts with PAs under basically no 
supervision.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;So at what point--how could you allow a single physician--
my next door neighbor, literally, in Clarence, New York--to 
write more prescriptions for opioids, millions of them, than 
any other doctor or in fact any other hospital in the State of 
New York?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;There's 20 million people in New York. My particular town 
of Clarence has about 50,000 people, and one doctor in the town 
of Clarence was writing more prescriptions than any doctor in 
the State of 20 million people or any hospital including New 
York City.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;    Took you guys 5 years to figure out there might be 
something suspicious? Would you agree that's unacceptable?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, so I wouldn't have any data on a
particular prescriber. DEA doesn't hold that set of data.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt; Well, he's now been indicted. They've seized
his cars. They've seized his bank accounts.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; So at some point, whether that was a DEA
case or a state local case, I don't know what it was that 
investigated him and----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt; It was a federal case.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; OK. So at some point we learned of that and
then there was----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;Yes, but what's going on with your computer
systems and other things? It takes you 4 or 5 years. I know how 
computers work, pretty much. I don't know how old yours are. 
Maybe they're XT tabletops. I am not sure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;    But this kind of data should be instantaneously available.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; And, sir, I go back to the states control
prescription monitoring program, not DEA. We control into a 
pharmacy. The doctor----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collins&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;Well, maybe you should be kicking some butt
going down the chain. I mean, if I was sitting in your job and 
you're on the hot seat right now, and you're telling me now, I 
mean, placing the blame on the states, that doesn't cut it in 
our world here. We are not looking to place blame. We are 
looking for solutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;My time has expired. We look forward to you coming back in 
another 4 or 5 months and having a different set of answers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Mr. Collins"&gt;    Thank you, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the gentleman from New York, 
Mr. Tonko, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;I want to find out if DEA uses data gathered through its 
ARCOS system to game disability into how many opioid pill 
distributors send to a town or region as a whole, even if the 
distributions are spread out over multiple pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Administrator Patterson, one town examined by the committee 
was Williamson, West Virginia, population 3,000. Our 
committee's investigation focused on two pharmacies in 
Williamson. The first is Tug Valley Pharmacy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Mr. Chair, could I ask that we please show minority exhibit 
three on the screen?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    OK. We have here the Tug Valley Pharmacy. According to 
DEA's ARCOS data, between 2006 and 2016, Tug Valley Pharmacy 
received over 10 million doses of opioids from 13 different 
distributors. This includes over 3 million pills just in 2009. 
So Administrator Patterson, this is an unbelievable quantity of 
opioids for a pharmacy this size in a town of 3,000. Does DEA 
believe the amount of opioids this pharmacy received was 
excessive?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; In 2009 I would say so, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;And, again, Mr. Chair, if we could please put
minority exhibit four up on the screen. This is the second 
pharmacy in Williamson--Hurley Drug--that we see on the screen 
here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;ARCOS data show that Hurley received over 10.5 million 
doses of opioids from 11 different distributors between 2006 
and 2016. This includes over 2 million doses in both 2008 and 
in 2009. Mr. Patterson, again, this strikes me as an excessive 
amount of opioids for a pharmacy in a town of 3,000 to receive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    Do you agree that this is unreasonable?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would agree.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;I've mentioned that both of these pharmacies are
located in Williamson and, incidentally, both of them are still 
in operation today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;I want to show you where they are located. So if we could 
please post minority exhibit five on the screen, and combined 
distributor shipped over 20.8 million doses of opioids to these 
two pharmacies, which you can see on our screen, are located 
only blocks apart and they did that 20.8 million doses of 
opioids between 2006 and 2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    Mr. Patterson, between 2006 and 2016, what kind of ARCOS 
data analyses did DEA do to alert it when distributors shipped 
an unwarranted amount of opioids into a town or region so that 
it could stop these excessive distributions?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Again, sir, I would have to go back and look
at that specific example and look at the data set in terms of 
where those periods of time were.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    As I already testified previously, we use the data in a 
very different way today than we did then. But I would want to 
go back and specifically look at the time frame and what was 
going on and I can get back to you on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; If the data were used today, as you use it today
would it have avoided something like this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would hope so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; Well, can we have a little more of an answer? I
am hoping is good, but----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I would like to--part of the important issue
that we are talking about today is to go back and look at these 
specific examples.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Like I said, I have seen examples where on ARCOS data we 
actually can't see some of these anomalies. So I think, in 
taking these examples back and looking at them and we are using 
a time frame of 2006 to 2016, I can't tell you for the last 
couple of years what that ARCOS data has been, as I sit here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Traditionally, what we've seen is very high levels of 
distribution into those places between 2008 to 2010 or 2011 
when we started to look at this data in different ways.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Still not nearly as proactively as we do today. But that's 
why I would like to take this example back and look and get 
back to you on essentially what's happened with that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;I have been dealing with this issue a great deal in my 
district and when I hear of opioids being the gateway to the 
illness of addiction, it's very disturbing, and the heartache 
and the pain and, unfortunately, the death associated with that 
illness is a crisis and we need to do something very valuable 
here and I would implore that the folks at DEA be smarter in 
their approach.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chair.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania, 
Mr. Costello, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    Are you aware that the DEA's chief ALJ authored quarterly 
reports describing DEA's declining use of ISOs and noted in 
June 2014, ``an alarming low rate of agency diversion 
enforcement activity'' on a national level?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I have read those, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;For the last several years, the chief ALJ has
reported declining number of ISOs to the DEA administrator on a 
quarterly basis. This issue had also been raised in the 
committee's investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    Why has the number of DEA ISOs declined significantly over 
the past few years?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I think there's two things when you look at
those statistics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    I think that, although warranted, the statistics were very 
high in 2010 and 2011 because of the issue that we were dealing 
with in Florida and how those ISOs were being used. I think 
during this latter part we have gotten to a point of in trying 
to expedite the surrender of registrations we have much more 
gone into a posture of trying to get voluntary or surrender for 
cause orders.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Is there still a need today, as there was in
2011, for the DEA enforcement tool of ISOs?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;A 2013 report by the chief ALJ stated the
DEA's chief counsel had ``instituted a new vetting QA 
initiative'' that could be slowing the progress of diversion 
cases.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    What was this initiative?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I don't know if it was initiative or if it
was guidance. I think the----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; What was the guidance? Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I think the issue at play here was directed
towards distributors, not necessarily directed at doctors and 
pharmacies.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Have you provided that guidance in full to
this committee?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; We have not.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Will you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's a conversation that we've had with
Mr. Walden and we'll continue to work forward on that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; When a state revokes the medical license of a
doctor, that doctor is no longer eligible to have a DEA 
registration associated with that medical license, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; When the doctor no longer has state authority
to prescribe does the DEA have to conduct any further 
investigation or can DEA execute revocation of DEA registration 
by just obtaining the certificate of the medical license 
revocation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; We can do an order to show cause.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; No investigation is needed?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct, because they've lost state
authority.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; After a state revocation of the doctor's
medical license, how quickly is DEA notified about the 
revocation and how long does it take for DEA to revoke the 
doctor's DEA registration?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's where we need to be working with the
state medical boards to learn of that information. Our field 
division offices are responsible for that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Are the vast majority of DEA enforcement
actions in diversion litigation cases comprised of these no 
state authority cases that do not involve DEA investigation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; In terms of the orders to show cause?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Yes?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Is it estimated to be about 80 percent of
their actions?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would believe that's probably a fair
number.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Mr. Chair, I would like to yield the balance
of my time to you, Mr. Griffith.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;When I was asking you questions earlier, we talked about 
the ISOs and the apparent requirement--I know you didn't do it 
but the apparent requirement for a medical expert in advance of 
issuing an ISO and the fact that that would take a number of 
weeks and you said 45 to 90 days. I went through all the 
different steps that might actually lead to that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;So you agree that it's the DEA's mission to protect the 
public safety and we agree that there's a tremendous amount of 
delay and part of that delay in no small measure is the 
requirement that before you get that administrative tool of the 
ISO you have to get a medical expert.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    So can you, as acting administrator, agree with me today 
that you would be willing to reexamine the medical expert 
requirement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; And I appreciate that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; And again, we are using the word
requirement. I think these documents are in reference to 
distributors and not doctors and pharmacies. But I would be 
happy to go back and look into that further.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Yes, it was actually reference to doctors and
pharmacies. But that's OK. As long as we are working it out, 
that's where we want to go. We want to make things better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;And one of the reasons that I get so passionate about this 
is you saw Mr. Tonko's minority slide of Hurley Drug earlier. 
Well, Hurley, Virginia, is 33 miles from Williamson, West 
Virginia, where that drug store is located. And anybody with 
any sense knows that a big bunch of those pills were coming 
into my district.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Likewise, I had some additional questions that dealt with 
the fact that we have problems with red flags being raised that 
apparently takes a while to be picked up on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;So we had a doctor in Giles County who was sending his 
patients over to West Virginia to get drugs. We have a 
situation in Martinsville where they have, according to the 
CDC, they prescribe more opioid pain killers than anywhere else 
in the U.S. per capita and where another doctor was prescribing 
opioids for patients in North Carolina.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    So I look forward to working with you to solve these 
problems. But these are real world problems, real world people, 
and real word deaths.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I agree with you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I yield back. I now recognize Congresswoman
Walters for five minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Mrs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Mr. Patterson, it's my understanding that the DEA often 
uses tips and information it receives from state and local law 
enforcement to develop cases against entities or individuals 
suspected of engaging in or facilitating illicit drug 
diversion. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Walters. According to the DEA, the Automated Reports 
and Consolidated Ordering System, or ARCOS, provides the agency 
with retail level data regarding controlled substance 
transactions. Does this mean, for example, ARCOS can show many 
doses of hydrocodone or oxycodone an individual pharmacy 
received in a given year?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Mrs. Walters. In fact, as part of its investigation, the 
Committee has obtained and analyzed ARCOS data for parts of 
West Virginia to great effect. So we recognize how important a 
tool it can be.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;In February of this year, DEA announced that it was adding 
a feature to ARCOS that will allow manufacturers and 
distributors to view the number of companies that have sold a 
particular controlled substance to a prospective customer in 
the preceding 6 months.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mr. Paterson, does this policy enable companies to see the 
amount of controlled substances its current customers are 
receiving from other suppliers?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Yes. Part of the suspicious orders is them
knowing their customers to know when to file these concerns.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Walters. Does the newly added features in ARCOS 
provide state and local law enforcement with greater access to 
the system's retail level data?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I would have to find out if it provides at
the state level. When we work investigations with the state 
level--the state and local level, obviously, we can share that 
data as part of an investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;This is also part of the issue that we are dealing with the 
states' attorneys general on as to how to share these data sets 
to be more proactive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Mrs. Walters. OK. According to a letter the DEA sent to the 
committee in November of last year, DEA will share ARCOS data 
with law enforcement on a need to know basis and when they are 
operating in coordination with the DEA for investigative 
purposes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    So is it fair to say that the state and local law 
enforcement entities do not have access to DEA ARCOS data on a 
real-time basis?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;If we are working an investigation we'll
share that data in real time with them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Walters. OK. Is DEA developing any proposals that will 
enhance state and local law enforcement's ability to access and 
utilize ARCOS data?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Again, we are working jointly with them and
this also goes back to the effort with our states attorneys 
general.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Mrs. Walters. OK. In order to effectively combat the opioid 
epidemic we need an all hands on deck approach. The DEA has 
data that could assist state and local law enforcement to 
identify potential sources of illicit drugs in their 
communities and I think the agency should be exploring every 
avenue to provide this data to law enforcement as quickly as 
possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;It seems to me that providing state and local police with 
access to ARCOS data would be beneficial to the DEA as well, 
effectively providing the agency with additional eyes and ears 
on the ground, likely resulting in additional leads being 
produced to the agency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mr. Patterson, will you commit to examine ways to improve 
state and local law enforcement's access to ARCOS data so that 
bad actors might be able to be identified with greater 
frequency and effectiveness?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Yes, ma'am.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Walters. Thank you, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I now recognize the gentlelady from Indiana,
Mrs. Brooks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Hello, Mr. Patterson. Since 2011, the number of immediate 
suspension orders issued by the DEA, as you have even noted, 
declined significantly from a high of 65 in 2011 down to a low 
of 6 in 2017. So I want to talk about that a little bit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Are there instances in which the DEA pursues an immediate 
suspension order, the ISO, in parallel with related potential 
criminal investigation?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So, ma'am, since October, so the
administrator's position signs the ISOs when they're issued. 
What I have traditionally seen is because of the process of 
where a criminal case is being investigated there's been a 
delay in the ISO process as they're gathering evidence.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;One of the concerns I have, and it goes back to, again, 
what Mr. Griffith said, is that cuts against the very argument 
that we have an imminent problem that we are trying to deal 
with.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So, again, my conversations that I've had with both U.S. 
and states attorneys are is that we have to act much faster in 
these cases in terms of if we have ongoing harm and we have the 
ability to stop that harm, even at the peril of a criminal 
case, then that's what we should be doing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And let's be clear. The U.S. doesn't do the 
immediate suspension orders. Those are done by the DEA.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;The DEA. It's an administrative action.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And are you saying that the U.S. attorneys 
were asking--as a former U.S. attorney are you saying the U.S. 
attorneys were asking or telling DEA not to issue ISOs?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;In trying to gather evidence in their
criminal case.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. I understand, but that can take months if not 
years sometimes in criminal cases. Do you believe that's what 
happened prior to you coming in October of 2017--that delays 
happened?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I think that's been an ongoing theme of what
some of these delays are caused by.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And why would the DEA delay that type of 
administrative action in pursuit of a criminal investigation? 
Why?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Because people believe that the criminal
investigation is an important endeavor towards whether it's 
that doctor or that pharmacy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Well, it is very important, no doubt, because 
that person is, obviously, distributing--or the belief is 
distributing illicitly. But why would an immediate suspension--
is that so that undercover operations can happen with the 
physician?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Yes, ma'am.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And the prescriber?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;The gathering of evidence.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And what is the new guidance, and I appreciate 
the importance of gathering of evidence, but what is the new 
guidance relative to ISOs and criminal investigations that you 
are contemplating or that are in place now, and is that 
guidance in writing?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So it is not formalized. This is
conversations that I've been having with the AGAC, the, you 
know, advisory----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. I served on the attorney general's advisory 
counsel.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;And to the extent that I've been meeting
with states' attorneys to try and talk to them about the same 
issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So I think we have to, again, a lot of this is striking a 
balance. I, frankly, feel that a lot of these cases can be 
worked backward on the criminal aspect.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I understand that their desire in a lot of these cases is 
to be able to get contemporaneous evidence, use undercover, 
right, as opposed to having to use witnesses that have come in 
that maybe not have the best of backgrounds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So I understand that balance. The concern I have, like I 
said, if we are using an ISO, it feels awful weird to be 
signing that ISO a year after we learned of that problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And I noticed in the document that Dr. Burgess 
had there was some of that, that the ISO was a year after the 
arrest even.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Although at the time of the arrest, typically 
that individual would be under their medical licensing 
procedures as well. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. But wouldn't it make more sense to in many 
ways implement an ISO in the middle of the criminal 
investigation because those can take months if not years, and 
in the meantime we've got all of these people dying.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I couldn't agree with you more and, quite
frankly, even in the absence of the ISO, my concern is is that 
why aren't we trying to get a voluntary surrender as quickly as 
we have. And we have a lot of offices that do that in a very 
expeditious manner.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And will your proposed guidelines impose a cap 
on the length of time it can be delayed? Is that the kind of 
discussion you're having. You're looking at, like, 30 days? 
Forty-five days?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I think, striking that balance, we have to
figure out where the days are. There will probably always be 
that exception that comes up and I think as long as people are 
willing to--whether it's a U.S. attorney or a states' attorney 
that is willing to put in writing why we need to delay and we 
can evaluate that, I think that's something.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;The process itself I think we have to work through. Like I 
said, we have new head of diversion control. This is an issue 
that has been bothering me greatly. Since October I've seen 
these and I've signed them and I have generally the same 
question every time, which is why are they taking so long.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And for the record, I would just like to 
acknowledge when I became a U.S. attorney in 2001 one of the 
very first huge cases we did was against a doctor, Dr. Randolph 
Lievertz, for over-prescription of oxycodone, and DEA in 2001, 
2002 and beyond said prescription drugs were going to be the 
next crisis in this country. Didn't start in 2010, didn't start 
in 2011. It was back in 2001, 2002, and we had a huge focus on 
it during that period of time and it's just really been very 
devastating, seeing that we fell off of that commitment it 
feels like in the last several years. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the chairman of the Full 
Committee for some follow-up questions. Mr. Walden.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you. I appreciate the indulgence of the
committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;You raise an interesting issue about the U.S. attorneys 
weighing in here and saying to the DEA, stop--don't do your 
ISO--we want to proceed with the criminal investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;One question--do they have the authority to override your 
ISO authority? That would be one. And then I want to know the 
who, what, when, where, why.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Who are the U.S. attorneys that interceded on which cases 
in what areas and told the DEA suspend, and do they have that 
authority? Because, to Mrs. Brooks' point, people continue to 
die during this period, and I want to know this--this is part 
of our public policy debate here is does a U.S. attorney's 
office somewhere have the authority to tell you don't do the 
ISO, don't stop the death because we got to investigate and go 
criminal, which will have a bigger penalty, which I respect.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    But is it one agent somewhere? One U.S. attorney in one 
state, is that why West Virginia went off the rails? And so I 
would like you to get back to the committee with answers to 
those questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would be happy to do so, sir. And look,
what I can assure this committee is I think this is a topic 
that we have had some robust discussion on lately as we've gone 
through these and I will also assure you that the direction of 
this administration is to stop the harm as quickly as possible.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; But I think you should be able to answer the
one question. Do the U.S. attorneys have the authority to 
overrule your agency's decision making? I know you weren't 
there running it at the time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I would believe that we could issue the ISO
even against the wishes of a U.S. attorney or a state's 
attorney. It probably doesn't help relationships to take those 
kinds of unilateral actions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    But, that said, I think part of this is the education of us 
holding up these things, why they look at either criminal or 
civil actions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; I would go back to Mr. Griffith's analogy. If
you have got a drunk driver driving down the road, you don't 
wait until they have the fatal accident to pull them over and 
stop them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I couldn't agree with you more.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;You can prosecute them along the way and I
would think you could make the case, going backwards, because 
the prescriptions have been written. The pills have been sent 
out.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    These two pharmacies we raised with you months ago are, my 
understanding, still operating in West Virginia. Are they not?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I don't know. Those are the ones I have to
go----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;They're not operating. All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Well, if you can get back to us on the who, what, when, 
where, why on these U.S. attorneys that would be good.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, 
Mr. Carter, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Patterson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Mr. Patterson, I suspect you know that currently I am the 
only pharmacist serving in Congress, and Mrs. Brooks makes a 
good point. This is not something that started in 2010 or 2011. 
It was going on in 2001 and 2002. I was practicing back then. 
Now, granted, I haven't practiced in quite a while. It's 
probably been 4 or 5 years since I practiced. But I still know 
what's going on out there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;We've been kind of nibbling or you have been nibbling 
around the edges here. There have been great questions asked 
here but I want to follow up on the questions that 
Representative Collins asked about the beginning of where this 
problem starts and that's the doctors who are writing these 
prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Now, I am not naive enough to believe that there aren't 
pharmacies out there that are in collusion with doctors or 
filling fraudulent prescriptions. But I want to talk about the 
doctors who are writing these prescriptions who are obviously 
out of control and why it's taken DEA so long to get them in 
control or under control.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I will just give you an example. I served in the Georgia 
State legislature for 10 years. I sponsored the legislation 
that created the prescription drug monitoring program back in 
2009. I was jumping up and down then, saying this is a problem, 
we've got to get it under control, and it was falling on deaf 
ears. There are doctors right now in our community that our 
pharmacists won't fill prescriptions for. They just say no, 
that doctor's out of control, I don't fill for that doctor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I was working one President's Day. We were out during our 
session. On President's Day we are always out. I had someone 
come into my pharmacy, a young lady who had the holy trinity of 
drug abuse--180, oxycodone, Xanax, and Soma, three 
prescriptions there. I looked at them. She gave me her driver's 
license from Florida. I said, I am not filling these 
prescriptions. She drove off in a car with Kentucky driver's 
license plates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Now, I am not going to fill those prescriptions unless I 
have a legitimate prescription, OK, and I didn't want to fill 
that. But you're putting me in the position where I've got to 
judge whether that patient is legitimate or not. I am not 
trained in law enforcement, but as a pharmacist. But I want to 
know why, when there are doctors out there who are writing 
these prescriptions why can't you get them quicker?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Mr. Collins is right. You ought to be able to turn that 
around in 48 hours. The first time I get three prescriptions 
for 180 of the oxycodone, Xanax, and Soma I know that doctor is 
out of control. Something's wrong there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I had a doctor who we didn't fill for, Dr. B. I went home 
about a year ago and some of the pharmacists were telling me, 
oh, they finally busted Dr. B. I thought, wow, why did it take 
them 5 years to bust him? We never filled his prescriptions for 
5 years but he kept on practicing. Well, they didn't exactly 
bust him. They got him for Medicare fraud. Didn't even get him 
for writing those prescriptions--never did.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Another example here, Dr. D.N. He got literally thousands 
of people addicted to these medications, and then he goes 
before the Composite Medical Board and gets slapped on the 
wrist, and they come back and they make him practice under the 
supervision of another doctor. That's his penalty. Now he lives 
on the waterfront, a beautiful home, beautiful cars, and yet 
thousands of people have been addicted because of these 
prescriptions that he has written.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="579" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;We wouldn't fill his prescriptions. He's a rogue doctor. We 
are not filling those. Tell me why it takes you so long to get 
to the alpha, to the beginning, to the doctors who are writing 
these prescriptions who are out of control. Explain that to me, 
because I don't understand it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    All you have to do is go into a community and say, what 
doctors do you not fill for, and the pharmacists will tell you, 
we don't fill for this doctor and we don't fill for that 
doctor.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Well, and that's, quite frankly, what we
have to rely on. Look, the one thing I am not going to do in 
this space is shift blame anyplace. This is a collective----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Well, it appears to me that that's what you're
doing because Mr. Collins is right. You can turn this around in 
48 hours. Just get those doctors out of there.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;But in the cases of these doctors, look,
when we do our reviews we ask information, try and solicit 
people to essentially, in the registrant community to come in 
and talk about the registrants they have problems with.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    If that doesn't happen, then our next course is someone 
that's been arrested that says, this is what's happening in a 
criminal case.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; But you can understand our frustration. When we
don't fill prescriptions for that doctor but for years--
literally, 4 or 5 years, they continue to practice.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I understand, and this is where PMP data
becomes absolutely critical and it's because that isn't----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; But what can we do to help you to be able to
get these doctors under control? What can we do? Tell me what 
we can do in Congress.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; The PMP data is really what it boils down
to.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="589" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; We've had the PDMP since 2009 in Georgia.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="590" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; But, sir, DEA doesn't have access to that
data. It depends on the state.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="591" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Can you shut the doctor down? Can DEA shut the
doctor down or is that up to the Composite Medical Boards of 
the states?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="592" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; No, if we had someone that was showing us
that a doctor was over-prescribing then----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="593" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; But when you get this information of pill
dumping you know that that pharmacy is getting those 
prescriptions from somewhere. Then that ought to be an 
indication to you. We need to go to that community and we need 
to find out what's going on here. They're coming from 
somewhere.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="594" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Understood.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="595" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="596" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="597" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the gentleman from West 
Virginia, Mr. McKinley, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="598" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As not a member of
this committee, I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to 
raise some issues with that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="599" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    Again, Mr. Patterson, thank you for being here. Are you 
familiar with this book written by John Temple called 
``American Pain?''
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="600" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; No, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="601" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;This is about the clinic down in south
Florida that was the epicenter of the opioids. I really would 
suggest that you and everyone else that's paying attention to 
this read that book.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="602" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;But anyway, because with all due respect for the way some 
of your testimony has gone on this about ARCOS, he was able to 
assemble all of this book about drug abuse without access to 
ARCOS. So for someone to say that we couldn't access it, we 
couldn't use it because it was manual, it was too much 
information, this man was able to put it together and be able 
to demonstrate tthis ``American Pain'' clinic down in south 
Florida prescribed two times the amount of medicine of all the 
doctors combined in the State of Ohio. He was able to put that 
together long hand, and he's not an agency with all the 
resources you have to be able to do that. He also was able to 
put together all of the pill mills in Florida combined. So nine 
times the amount of pain medicine that was issued by every 
state in the country. He did that long hand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="603" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;So with all due respect, I don't think you can hide behind 
the fact that you didn't have the resources to be able to do 
this because it was coming in manually.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="604" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;If I could, I am curious about the production quotas with 
it because in the book he talks about how speed pills back in 
the 1970s were becoming a problem, and DEA stepped up and they 
cut the production by 90 percent and the problem went away.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="605" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;And then in the 1980s we had a problem with Quaaludes--same 
thing. They cut the production and it went away. Now, fast 
forward to today or what we've been dealing with over the last 
10 years or so, the opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="606" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;We continue to increase the production of opioids, continue 
to distribute those. Didn't we learn anything from the past 
experience, that we should be cutting back? And it wasn't until 
2017 that we actually had our first reduction. But it's still 
nearly 50 percent more than we were 10 years ago in production 
of opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="607" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    How would you respond to that? Didn't we learn anything?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;No, I understand that, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;And look, the quota numbers are set, unfortunately, to 
ensure access to the patients and you can see the disturbing 
trend that happened with quotas. The industry said more and 
more people needed these prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    We worked aggressively in the last year and a half to try 
and work on the quota issue and pull this back. I give a lot of 
the credit to the states.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;If I could recover my time, because I think
that perhaps I know you're meaningful to do this, to correct 
it, but it failed, because I am coming from that state that has 
52 drug overdoses per 100,000 people. We are leading the Nation 
with this. Someone has to get to this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    So I am just curious, I know you have the ability to 
transfer resources and funds within DEA. So my question goes 
back to you--have you made any transfer back into West 
Virginia? Are you going to put more resources there in West 
Virginia as a result of your ability to do transfer?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; We have, and we are continuing to do so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt; We just put in a year or so ago down, a
tactical diversion squad in Clarksburg. I think that's the 
second one we have in West Virginia. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt; Leading the Nation--is that sufficient? Do
you think that you have diverted enough attention into West 
Virginia that you don't need to divert any more funds and 
resources into West Virginia?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Sir, the creation of the Louisville
division, which polled three states all struggling with this 
same problem: Tennessee, West Virginia, and----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt; I am sorry. I am just dealing with West
Virginia. It's the epicenter. You know that and I know that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Sir, so we----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Mr. McKinley [continuing]. It has been there for nearly 10 
years. It's been the highest level and we've not seen the 
resources come in to West Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;And now I appreciate very much that you put a tactical 
diversion squad, or your predecessor did, into Clarksburg. But 
I've got to think there is a lot more attention needs to go 
with it because if this man can do this by long hand, can put 
this information together, I think you all could do it. With 
your resources, you could do a far better job and save a lot of 
lives and turn some families around.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    So I am asking you, please, to look at more diversion into 
West Virginia--some of the funds and resources that you can to 
help out in this situation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Again, sir, we've been working on that and
we are continuing to put more resources into that particular 
division.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;So what are the optics on this, in the 10
seconds I've got left? How am I going to be able to measure 
whether you're successful with what you're doing?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    Because just last year in county we've already had a 50 
percent increase in overdose drug--overdose deaths in West 
Virginia in my county. How are we going to measure this? Are we 
going to see a drop next year?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Look, the concern we have had is that we've
seen the shift into fentanyl and other illicit substances. The 
goal is to continue to drive down the prescription rates and 
the diversion of prescription pills, and we are going to have 
to work this licit market and, frankly, the place----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt; Again, what are the optics? Am I going to see
a decline next year?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would hope we see declines across the
board. I think some states are going to take longer than 
others, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt; Thank you. Yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="630" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="631" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the vice chairman, Mr. 
Griffith, for follow-up questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate
it, and this question was from Mrs. Brooks, who, unfortunately, 
had to step out for a minute.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Do the Medicaid fraud control units run by the state AG's 
offices still exist in many states?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would have to find out, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;All right, because what she was indicating
was was that these particular MFCUs who are going after 
Medicaid fraud often can also pick up over prescribing data and 
that that's a collaborative unit that you all ought to be 
looking at in the various states to figure out who the rogue 
doctors are and that would help you in that regard as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Mr. Patterson, moving on, can you explain to me how can you 
all maintain that voluntary registration surrender can be as 
effective a tool in protecting the public safety as an ISO if 
it takes years to get the voluntary surrender as in the case of 
the owner of the Sav-Rite No. 1 in Kermit, West Virginia?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would assume in that case and, again, I
need to get the particular facts on it--the voluntary surrender 
probably came as part of the criminal case.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; And so what you would do is you would reverse
that order and have the voluntary surrender or an ISO happening 
early on?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Absolutely, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Again, I can't go back and necessarily understand why 
certain people did certain things----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; But you can make sure, going forward, that we
shorten the time?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Absolutely, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;All right. In your written testimony, you
mentioned prescription drug monitoring programs as a tool that 
can be used to combat prescription drug diversion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    How does the DEA currently utilize the PDMP data in its 
investigations?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; So this varies state to state because the
concern is, again, is our access to this data and how we can 
access this data and that is a state by state decision. And so 
every state varies. This is one of the big conversations that 
we've had with the 48 states that are parts of these two 
coalitions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;All right. Let us know how we can help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Your written testimony also mentioned that law enforcement 
access to PDMP data varies widely from state to state, as you 
have just told us. Can you tell me what the DEA is doing to 
address those concerns and to address any access barriers the 
agency currently faces with respect to the PDMPs?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Again, working with all the states
individually on these issues and to the extent that we can 
leverage the coalitions to help us in that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    Look, in a perfect world we have a federal PDMP process 
that we can take all this data and put together. I think in a 
less than perfect world at a minimum the states all need to be 
able to share this data with each other.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; And in your experience, are there areas--and
you just have gone over some of it--but is there some other 
areas that we might be able to improve the PDMP process?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I think that's the key piece.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. I yield----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mr. Patterson, just to give you a little update, I am going 
to recognize Mr. Carter in just a minute for a follow-up 
question. Then Ms. DeGette and myself will have concluding 
questions and we'll be done shortly. So thank you for being 
here with us today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize Mr. Carter, the gentleman from 
Georgia.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be very brief.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I just want to follow up, Mr. Patterson. You're correct, 
you can't do anything about what happened years ago. But you 
can do a lot about what's happening now. I want to give you a 
sincere caution here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="659" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;What's happening with the wholesalers when they are 
limiting the pharmacies from getting a certain amount of drugs 
whereas that has all the best of intentions--what it causes 
sometimes is for some of our patients not to be able to get the 
medications that they need and I just warn you to please be 
careful with that. There are patients out there, i.e., hospice 
patients, who truly need these medications.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="660" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;We found ourselves running out and we couldn't order it 
from the wholesalers because we'd already used up our limit for 
that month. So that put these people in a very precarious 
position and it's not a good position.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="661" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;It's a very bad feeling for a pharmacist to have to profile 
and have to go out and say, oh, this patient doesn't need pain 
medication. Who am I to say that the long-haired tattooed body-
pierced person is not in pain? That's not fair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="662" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;We've got to make sure that we get this under control and I 
still maintain that starting with the physicians and tell me 
what I can do to help you, to give you the tools that you need 
so that you can react quicker and get them under control when 
they get out of control.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="663" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;That's all I am asking you to do is tell me what you need 
because I promise you I will do my best to get you those 
resources so that you can get these rogue physicians--and 
they're not all of them but some of them--a good amount of them 
are out of control and they get out of control quickly and it 
gets out of control very, very quickly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="664" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Patterson.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="665" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Understood.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="666" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="667" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The chair will now recognize the ranking member, Ms. 
DeGette, for concluding questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="668" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thanks, Mr. Chairman, and I want to echo, this
is a rough topic, Mr. Patterson, and we know you haven't been 
there that long. But we also know that it's urgent that we get 
this right. It's just urgent for the safety of our 
constituents.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="669" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    There's just a couple of areas I wanted to clarify. Mr. 
Collins was asking you some questions about these--the 
settlement that the DOJ has had with some of the distributors 
because of issues--reporting suspicious orders and it's really 
important that they report these suspicious orders to you 
because you can't do your job unless you get this reporting. 
Isn't that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="670" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="671" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Now, for example, the DOJ has reached two
settlements with Cardinal Health. In 2008, Cardinal agreed to 
pay $34 million to resolve allegations that it shipped large 
quantities of opiates to pharmacies without reporting those 
orders to the DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="672" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    And then in 2012 again, Cardinal agreed to pay $44 million 
to resolve similar claims. Now, do you know, broadly speaking, 
why the Department of Justice decided to pursue these cases 
against Cardinal?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I don't, ma'am. I know that, from the
documents I have seen on the 2012 case, the frustration was is 
that the MOUs or MOAs in that scenario essentially they had 
gone back and violated again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; So that is probably the basis for----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="676" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; That's your understanding?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Now, McKesson similarly reached two agreements
with DOJ agreeing to pay $13.25 million in 2008 and again $150 
million in 2017 to resolve allegations that it failed to report 
suspicious orders. Would you suspect it's the same kind of a 
situation that you talked about a minute ago?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Now, do you agree that suspicious order
reports are a key part of preventing diversion?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="681" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Absolutely, because, again, I go back to the
fact that the manufacturers and distributors are the key 
registrants that we need to hear from.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="682" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Right. Right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="683" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Now, if distributors fail to report suspicious orders, they 
really do undermine your ability to oversee the supply chain. 
Is that right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="684" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="685" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;One more topic, and this is following up on
something Ms. Walters was asking you about, and I don't think 
maybe you understood her question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    On this website that you have been talking about that you 
have for distributors to look at, it lets other distributors 
see if other distributors are providing to these pharmacies. 
But it does not tell volume. Isn't that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; I would have to check it. I believe it does.
It goes back a 6-month window. But I would get back to you on 
that particular issue.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; I think so, because it's my understanding that
the distributors object to disclosing volume. Here, your 
associate's handing you something.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="689" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; No volume.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="690" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;No volume. OK. And, from my perspective I can
understand what they're saying about that impacting trade 
secrets and so on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    But the problem, from my perspective, is if you're just 
saying, OK, we are going to have a website where you can see if 
other distributors are providing in that area, if you don't 
know the volume then it's really hard for somebody to see 
whether there's an abuse going on or not. Wouldn't you agree 
with that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Yes, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="693" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I think this website is something we should
probably talk about more and maybe you can supplement your 
answers to see how we can use that effectively, because just 
knowing if other people are going in there I don't think that's 
going to solve our problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="694" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="696" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Just for clarification, it appears in 2008 that Cardinal 
Health paid $34 million in civil penalties and then again in 
2016 an additional $10 million was paid out through one of its 
subsidiaries, Kinray--if that clarifies that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="697" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Through our investigation, Mr. Patterson, the committee has 
learned certainly that as early as 2008 the DEA received almost 
daily suspicious order reports, which received millions of 
opioids that had been tied to known pill mill physicians like 
Mr. Collins' neighbor that he referenced. Yet, most continue to 
remain in operation and it's unclear to what extent, if any, 
DEA followed up on the suspicious order reports it received.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="698" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    So tell us what is the process that the DEA takes when 
evaluating suspicious order reports it receives and the actions 
that the agency takes in response?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So, sir, when those come in they're
currently reviewed by and looked at for investigation by the 
divisions. This is one of the changes that we are making by 
bringing this into headquarters process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="700" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;Some of these companies, obviously, have districts all 
throughout the country. One of the reasons why we want to look 
at them is because we want to look at them as a corporation, 
not just as individual entities or other problem areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="701" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    So that is a change that we are doing. I would be happy to 
go back and look at specific issues on----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Sure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mr. Patterson [continuing]. Any of SORS database and what 
was or wasn't done. I think the decentralization--we have had 
structural problems, I would say, in terms of how we used not 
just some of this information but how we looked at it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Those structural changes we are rapidly trying to get a 
handle on to make these--especially in the suspicious orders 
reports more beneficial because, one, we need them for the 
registrants, but two, we have to do something with them when we 
get them. And you have discussed implementing the process to 
improve and to process those suspicious orders at DEA 
headquarters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Has DEA identified breakdowns in the way its field division 
processes suspicious order reports in the past and what 
corrections or adjustments have been made or do you anticipate 
being made?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="706" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So, again, I think the uniformness of how we
look at these things and the accountability that we hold the 
people to when we get these reports is critical.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="707" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;So that's one of the big changes for us to make sure that 
as we are looking at these--I have had conversations with all 
of the staff in this space, whether, it goes back to the ALJ or 
the folks in chief counsel that do it with our expectations, to 
go back to what Mr. Collins was talking about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="708" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    It has not been comfortable conversations. But we have to 
essentially do the things that we are supposed to be doing each 
and every day and personalities can't play a role in this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="709" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; And when you were making decisions at DEA
headquarters, the personnel at the headquarters probably have 
field experience in some level in DEA. Would that be a fair 
assessment?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="710" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="711" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; And as you're looking at these, are you also
taking into consideration those that are in the field now maybe 
that have never been to headquarters to try to get their input 
on the actual boots on the ground?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="712" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;I think it's important and, look, I haven't
spent years in this diversion world. In fact, I've really only 
done it for about the last 18 months as the deputy and now as 
acting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="713" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt;    What I will tell you is that fresh sets of eyes on problem 
sets are always critically important.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="714" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="715" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;You talked about well, what do we do--prevention, 
education, treatment. Your role is really in enforcement and 
prosecution, at least laying the groundwork for that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="716" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The problem that we see as we look at this in great detail 
is local law enforcement does not have the capability to take 
care of this issue. That's why you see many of these cases 
coming out of rural areas. So we would certainly want to make 
sure that you're doing things to pivot, to take care of the 
rural areas in this country as you're looking at that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="717" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Now, there were a number of times that you referenced, I 
will get back to you or we'll get you that information. So just 
know that we'll have follow-up on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Patterson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="718" speaker="Mr. Patterson"&gt; Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="719" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And we'll look for that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="720" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;We should be able to work together on this, and just know 
that we are not happy that the chairman of the full committee, 
Chairman Walden, had to even call for a press conference.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="721" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;So we want to make sure, going forward, there are things 
that we need to know or things that we need to inquire on or 
things that you have for us. We would prefer more openness 
between the committee and the DEA, going forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="722" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And with that we thank you for your time today, for what 
turned into a fairly long time for you. It's been helpful to us 
and we look forward to the follow-up questions that we have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="723" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I want to thank the members who have attended today and 
participated in today's hearing and I will remind members that 
they have 10 business days to submit questions for the record 
and I would ask, Mr. Patterson, if you would see that those are 
responded to promptly as you receive those.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="724" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;With that, the subcommittee is adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="725" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;[Whereupon, at 12:23 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="726" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;[Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
