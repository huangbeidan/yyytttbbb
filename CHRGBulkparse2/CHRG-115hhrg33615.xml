    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF BRENT ORRELL, VICE PRESIDENT, FAMILY AND ECONOMIC&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="BRENT ORRELL"&gt;               STABILITY, ICF INTERNATIONAL, INC.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. ORRELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member
Davis, for inviting me here today. I am here to discuss a 
report that I co-authored with Dr. Harry Holzer at Georgetown 
University and Robert Doar of the American Enterprise Institute 
on ``Getting Men Back to Work: Solutions from the Right and 
Left.'' I want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for 
the excellent summary and introduction as to the problem at 
hand. I am going to skip over another explanation of the 
problem and instead talk about solutions to this problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;If we want to reverse this downward spiral that we are 
facing, in terms of availability and willingness to participate 
in jobs, we need to look at three key areas, and I would like 
to highlight those. First of all, building skills among men 
seeking work, incentivizing job creation, and then focusing on 
special populations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;To improve employment and wages among not-in-labor-force 
males, it is vital to enhance skills in the form of 
postsecondary credentials--including certifications and 
associate degrees--using research validated sector-based 
strategies that focus on high-growth, high-wage occupations. 
This will require regionally focused, data driven employment 
programs that align training with high-growth industries and 
occupations. Congress should provide guidance to the 
Departments of Education and Labor to expand sector-based 
strategies in secondary, postsecondary, technical training 
programs, and apprenticeships, as well as consider new 
strategies to apply these specifically to out-of-workforce 
males.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;Second, Congress should review laws governing existing 
public development finance instruments to expand employment 
opportunities for disengaged workers through the use of 
community benefit agreements, or CBAs. ICF has been working 
with Sagamore Associates in Baltimore, Maryland to leverage a 
CBA associated with the passage of a recent $525 million tax 
increment financing package to create a robust project-specific 
workforce development initiative.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;Sagamore has committed to setting aside for Baltimore 
residents 30 percent of the estimated 40,000 jobs this project 
will generate, and this commitment is backed by $40 million in 
developer-funded workforce development activities to find, 
train, and place Baltimore residents in construction and 
follow-on jobs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;Third, we need to focus on special populations. Large 
numbers of men come into contact with government agencies 
through child support enforcement and the corrections and 
criminal justice system. Congress should take steps to 
strengthen workforce development aspects of both of these 
programs. In child support, we endorsed continued Federal and 
State efforts to right size child support orders and to develop 
debt forgiveness strategies that will encourage work rather 
than penalize it. We also believe more needs to be done to 
improve employment opportunities for noncustodial parents 
through innovative strategies like NCP Choices in Texas that 
combine a clear work, pay, play, or pay the consequences option 
with enhanced workforce development services. We also recommend 
that Congress increase incentives to States to pay for these 
enhanced services by strengthening the Federal child support 
match for employment-related services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;Finally, for incarcerated populations and those who have 
recently returned from prison, we have a key opportunity to 
increase engagement of men in work. Through the U.S. Department 
of Labor, Congress has invested in pre- and post-release 
programs that pave the way for post-incarceration employment. 
These projects focus on connecting returning citizens to faith 
and community-based groups that help manage reentry and connect 
clients to training and employment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;A recent study funded by the Ford Foundation found that the 
highest performing of these DOL grants had a number of common 
attributes: they all worked closely with the criminal justice 
system, they all created tailored reemployment plans, and they 
all focused on helping clients gain industry-recognized 
credentials to boost post-release employment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;The Council of State Governments is doing groundbreaking 
work in aligning recidivism risk assessments with market-driven 
employability assessments in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and I highly 
recommend taking a close look at that. These and other 
successful strategies should be sustained, evaluated, refined, 
and then replicated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MIKE HENDERSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ABC BALTIMORE&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MIKE HENDERSON"&gt;    Mr. Henderson, you may begin.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. HENDERSON&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;Good afternoon. My name is Mike Henderson. I
am the president of Associated Builders and Contractors in 
Baltimore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, committee 
members, for your kind invitation to appear before this hearing 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;I am here today to talk about a workforce development 
program we developed 11 years ago in Baltimore city called 
Project JumpStart. I am joined by Mr. Tyrone Ferrens. He is a 
journeyman electrician, and one of our star graduates.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;Project JumpStart is an 89-hour pre-apprenticeship and job 
placement program. We run six classes every year, three on the 
east side of town and three on the west side. We have an 80 
percent graduation rate, and we graduate approximately 120 
students every year. But far more important than our graduation 
rate is our job placement rate, because at the end of the day 
the only true measuring stick that really matters with a 
workforce development program is this: are people getting jobs? 
And not just jobs, but jobs that have progressive salaries, 
jobs that provide recognized accredited training, and the 
opportunities to grow in their profession and in their careers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;In our case, our job placement rate is 75 percent, and that 
is an average over the 11 years, but in just the last couple 
years that placement rate is better than 80 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;Our program is primarily funded through private foundations 
like the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Weinberg Foundation, 
but over the last few years, we also are getting funding from 
the city of Baltimore and the State of Maryland. For the 
purposes of this hearing, my goal is to share with this 
committee some of the invaluable lessons that we have learned 
over the last 11 years on those elements that help make a 
program like ours successful. Hopefully, once I give you some 
background and some context about the program and our students, 
it will better explain why we are asked to be here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;To begin, our students are all Baltimore city residents. 
Seventy-five percent are ex-offenders. Nearly half of our 
graduates are over the age of 35. Many of our best success 
stories, including that of the gentleman seated next to me, 
involves graduates over the age of 40. Over the past couple 
years, there has been a strong push by our public and private 
funders to focus more on the 18-to-24-year-old population, a 
group that traditionally we have not done as well with.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;After the riots in Baltimore in the spring of 2015, we 
decided to bring in 20 to 25 of our best graduates and we held 
a focus group. One of the questions we asked them was: ``Why 
were you able to succeed when the guy who sat next to you in 
class or the guy who grew up across the street from you did 
not?'' They said they saw Project JumpStart as their best, last 
chance to succeed in life, and if they didn't stick with it, 
and apply themselves fully to it, in 6 months' time they would 
either be back in prison or dead.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;That wisdom and that sense of urgency is something we have 
seen from our older students, individuals who made a mistake 
earlier in life and are now looking for an opportunity to right 
that ship. Unfortunately, you don't get that kind of a life 
perspective without making mistakes and taking your lumps.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;A year ago, Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins 
Hospital wanted to meet with us to try to figure out why 
JumpStart works. Between those two entities, they spend over 
$100 million a year in construction, and part of Baltimore 
city's programs (where they encourage local hiring), they 
worked with a variety of workforce development programs. They 
said when they work with other programs, sometimes it takes 20 
candidates before one placement actually sticks. With us, we 
send them four and two or three of those people actually get 
jobs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;I can only speak to the population we work with every day, 
but the problem in Baltimore city is not that you have men who 
don't want to work, but you have men who don't know the path to 
get a good job. They don't have the connections with those who 
are making those hiring decisions. No one ever taught them how 
to build a network or how to make those connections. One of the 
most important things we learned, is that you have to be part 
of a community--employer community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Henderson follows:][GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Henderson "&gt;    ABC Baltimore represents nearly 650 commercial builders in 
our region, and we represent more builders' employers than 
anyone else in our area. There is a lot of well- meaning work 
development programs out there, but they are disconnected from 
the employment community. The employers have to be central to 
your program. And I can see I am running out of time.

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF TYRONE FERRENS, GRADUATE, PROJECT JUMPSTART&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="TYRONE FERRENS"&gt;    Mr. Ferrens, you may again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;I thank you for having me here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;Mr. Davis, the beginning of your statement sounded like you 
were describing me to a T. I was raised in a single-parent 
home. My father was an addict and a drug dealer in Brooklyn. He 
still is to this day. I saw him only on the weekends maybe once 
a month, and yet my two older brothers and myself followed him 
down that path exactly. We all have felony convictions. We have 
all spent time in jail. We have been through rehabs. I 
personally spent 16 years in the grips of a crack and heroin 
addiction prior to coming to JumpStart.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;My last conviction was a felony assault, and part of my 
sentence was a year of inpatient rehab. It was during that time 
I kind of came to grips with the fact that I was never going to 
amount to anything; but, I did leave with a single goal, and 
that was to see that my son didn't have to go through the same 
path I did. And in order to do that I was going to need to get 
a job and I was going to need to stay out of prison.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;I went to a career center in Baltimore, and they referred 
me to Project JumpStart. They were offering a $50 stipend to 
attend those classes, and that was enough for me to be 
interested in it. It was during the orientation I received a 
glimpse of hope for a better future, something I hadn't had. 
During my addiction, on plenty of occasions I didn't want to 
wake up in the morning. I didn't care if I lived or died. I 
didn't see any way, any route to a better future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;During that 13 weeks of training, I received training in 
everything as far as math to residential wiring. We had resume 
preparation, mock interviews. We did conflict resolution. We 
did an OSHA 10-hour class. They seemed to have had everything 
that we would need to be prepared to be successful in the 
workplace. We were taught what employers were expecting from 
us, and how to be successful on the job site. The different 
demographics and the different people from different 
ethnicities, races and religions on a job site is something 
that I hadn't been exposed to before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;In the beginning, they explained to me that if I graduated 
at the top of my class, that they could pretty much guarantee 
me a job. I graduated at the top of my class. Two weeks later, 
I was placed on a job. They were able to get me hired even 
though I had an 8-year gap in my resume. Four years after 
that--well, actually, 6 years, I completed my 8,000 hours of 
on-the-job training, 4 years of apprenticeship classes with 
ABC, and today I am a licensed journeyman, as Mike said.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;The biggest impact that this program has had on my life is 
that it goes far beyond me. My son is the first one to step 
foot on a college campus. My mother had retired and was 
struggling on Social Security, and after years of torment that 
I put her through as an addict I was able to move her into my 
home. I became a first-time homeowner last year. My daughter, 
who is 30 years old, spent half of her life with a father that 
was an addict and a disgrace and an embarrassment. She is 
presently in a JumpStart class that is taking place now. She 
looks up to me, she admires me, and she wants to follow in my 
footprints. That is three generations in my family that has 
been changed from this program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;I now mentor younger JumpStart clients. Throughout this 
entire process--I graduated 9 years ago--JumpStart has been 
there supporting me every step of the way. I mean, my problems 
have evolved. In the beginning, it was court dates and 
probation hearings and charges, pending charges. Now I call the 
director in regards to parenting skills. Because I didn't have 
a father I struggle in that area. She always reminds me how far 
I came, because my problems are the same problems regular 
people have now. We call them ``regular people problems.'' She 
explained to me that everyone has problems in relationships and 
with their spouses and with their children. I am grateful for 
that as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;It is just a genuine gift to have this program in my life. 
And I get questions all the time asking if there is one like it 
in other States. I get calls from my family members, and 
unfortunately, I have to say no. But I would like to see this 
committee just do something in this field to help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF ANTHONY LOWERY, DIRECTOR, POLICY AND ADVOCACY,SAFER FOUNDATION&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ANTHONY LOWERY"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Davis,
and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity 
to testify on the decline in the labor force participation of 
men. I represent Safer Foundation, a Chicago based nonprofit 
that has provided employment and support services for people 
with criminal records over the past four decades. The Safer 
Foundation believes that men and women who have made mistakes 
in the past should have an opportunity to be self-sufficient so 
that they can take care of their families and make our 
communities safer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;There is dignity in work. Our clients come to us because 
they want to work, and are willing to do everything in their 
power to earn the right to work. But our society's overemphasis 
on punishment at the expense of rehabilitation is affecting 
labor force participation rates and workforce morale. My 
interaction with directly impacted individuals has taught me 
that hopelessness rather than choice keeps people out of work. 
I have seen many very qualified people who have criminal 
records be denied employment, housing, or a license, decades 
after they have served their time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;The issue of criminal justice reform is a socioeconomic 
one. Our country cannot afford to continue to deprive returning 
individuals of a second chance to become contributing members 
of our communities. Instead of shunning them, it is imperative 
that we begin to view their reintegration as vital to our 
country's prosperity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;We have been good at filling prisons with sluggish and 
fostering reintegration and economic inclusion, an important 
ingredient of public safety. Our National Employment Law 
Project, one of our national partners, estimates that one in 
three Americans have some type of an arrest or conviction 
record that would interfere with their ability to get a job. 
Nearly half of U.S. children have a parent with a criminal 
record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;As a result, our agencies, our taxpayers are burdened by a 
preventable problem. Take the example of Illinois where, 
according to one estimate, 42 percent of working-age adults 
have an arrest or conviction record and where almost half of 
the 30,000 people released from the Illinois Department of 
Corrections were returned to it within 3 years of release. The 
Illinois Sentencing Policy Advisory Council estimates that 
recidivism amongst probationers and parolees and the formerly 
incarcerated cost the State of Illinois $16 billion over a 5-
year period.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;Mass incarceration and employment barriers faced by people 
with criminal records, combined with the opioid epidemic, have 
deflated the U.S. labor force participation rates, which are as 
low today as they were over 30 years ago. This has a tremendous 
negative impact on our economy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;The U.S. is experiencing a long period of economic 
expansion, but experts warn that this expansion will end 
prematurely if we don't relieve these structural strains on the 
labor force participation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;Safer Foundation has worked with people with arrest and 
conviction records for over 40 years. Research, in Safer's 
experience, has shown that employment is the most direct link 
to reduce recidivism. I go into prisons, I go into schools, I 
go into churches, and the biggest question I ask people when I 
go into the correctional facility is ``What are you going to do 
to stay free?'' Dignity, understanding, and viability are 
dependent on their ability to get a job.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;A Federal commitment to create more job opportunities or 
skills training will reduce the attendant strain on our 
criminal justice system and on taxpayers. It will increase the 
tax base, give employers credentialed employees, stabilize 
violent communities, and pull families out of intergenerational 
cycles of poverty and violence.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;As the labor market tightens, employers are more ready than 
ever to give people with records a fair shot. Safer is 
partnered with hundreds of employers to meet their workforce 
needs. Our newest initiative is our Safer Demand Skill 
Collaborative, which came out of our clients' desire for living 
wage jobs and economic mobilities in some high-growth 
industries like healthcare.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;As a result of our participation in healthcare, and when we 
started with our healthcare initiative, I think I was here a 
few years ago testifying and just looking at opportunities in 
high-growth industries, and we picked healthcare. We also 
partnered with Johns Hopkins Hospital, who have been hiring 
people with criminal records for over the past 15 years. We 
partnered with Hopkins. Now we have a consortium in Chicago 
with over 12 healthcare hospitals and networks, where out of 
the first 60 people we have got hired in healthcare, only one 
person has left that job.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;    So, again, what we feel that the Federal Government can 
provide incentives to contractors, and pass legislation modeled 
after laws in Michigan, Ohio, and Texas that provide negligent 
liability protection for employers who hire people with 
criminal records. We feel that would be an important pathway to 
employment and increasing opportunity in the workforce.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;Thank you very much. I really appreciate
each of your testimony. It is refreshing to see a focus on 
solutions. It is easy to identify a problem around here, it is 
more difficult to focus on solutions. As you speak from 
experience, it is important that you share your perspective, 
and, Mr. Ferrens, I can't thank you enough for sharing in a 
very direct and helpful way for us. We salute you. I look up to 
you, as well, for really making a difference in your life and 
allowing others to help with that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;I hear from employers all the time that they need 
employees. We have a large number of people who would like to 
leave poverty and, through economic opportunity, we can fill 
these gaps. I think we are more productive this way. JumpStart 
is important in this regard, especially as it impacts families.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;    Mr. Ferrens, if you could go back in time, what would have 
been something you would have changed to help you achieve 
success earlier in life?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;I thought about that in the past, and I
struggled in school. I was diagnosed with dyslexia in high 
school and I have just been diagnosed with adult ADHD as well. 
Academics weren't a strong suit for me, but hands-on and visual 
learning work well for me. Being that there is an emphasis on 
going to college, and I was struggling in school, I didn't see 
that as my route. I tried athletics, but my genetics failed me 
there. I wasn't given too many other options.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;    Had I been exposed to tradesmen, and known that you could 
make close to six figures as an electrician, and that it could 
be another route to live a successful, productive life, I would 
have probably chose it way earlier in life. It was just 
exposure to other things, to other routes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt; So you discovered JumpStart through a
career center and a stipend associated?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;Yes. I went to a career center just trying to
get anything. I really thought I would be working at McDonald's 
for the rest of my life. That ban-the-box thing is high on my 
agenda because people don't come out of prison wanting to go 
back to prison. It is due to a lack of opportunities and 
desperation that you go back to doing the things that you are 
accustomed to doing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;    Even now, 10 years in, there are jobs I can't get, as far 
as placements in facilities because of my conviction. I tried 
to move into a nicer neighborhood in a better school district 
for my son and I qualified financially, but because I had to 
put ``convicted of a felony,'' I was denied. It is a huge 
obstacle.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt; For about 10 years you are saying?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt; My last conviction was in 2007.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt; Mr. Henderson, if you could elaborate a
little more on JumpStart and what led to the creation and also 
deploying that and how you think that has been most effective 
in impacting the community. How long has it been around now?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. HENDERSON&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;Eleven years ago, Johns Hopkins was getting
ready to spend a billion something dollars to create a biotech 
community in their footprint of the hospital. They wanted to 
make sure that people who lived in that community benefited 
economically, so we responded to an RFP. We were selected.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;We made mistakes in the beginning. In the beginning, we 
tended to side towards leniency, and we realized that we were 
not producing candidates that employers wanted. They did great 
for a couple weeks, and then they flamed out. So very quickly 
we learned you train the way you work and need high standards, 
and that it is not for everybody. That is kind of an anathema 
to a lot of city politicians that it is not for everybody. But 
we maintained very high standards to get in, high standards to 
stay in, and high standards--a lot of times, and Tyrone can 
tell you this, that first placement isn't always the best 
placement. We have a full-time placement director, and she says 
do it, work hard, listen, show interest, I am going to find you 
a better placement. But it was kind of his proving ground.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;And so high standards, and it is so important that you are 
connected to employers. Everything we do is centered around 
what employers are looking for. One of the most effective 
things we do is we bring people like Tyrone back and they talk 
to students in class. Because at some point they have all been 
through a program, and when they first got into JumpStart they 
thought, well, this is just another program that somebody sent 
me to, maybe my probation officer. They found out very early 
JumpStart is different, because we have been able to build a 
team of people who are very serious about helping them succeed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;Is that pretty much what you are looking for? Chairman 
SMITH. I appreciate that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;    Any other comments others would like to offer? Mr. Lowery.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;Well, first of all, I would like to commend
Tyrone on his journey, also being a person with a past criminal 
record is one of the greatest challenges a person will ever 
face as far as having the anxiety, letting your family down, 
letting yourself down, then trying to reenter the workforce. 
Today, I am the director of policy and advocacy of Safer, 
recognized as a national advocate. In Illinois, I initiated the 
ban-the-box legislation, the occupational licensing 
legislation, the sealing legislation, but let me go and apply 
for a job, a 20-year-old criminal record would determine what 
the employer felt I was.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;    I always talk to our people with every class that comes 
into our building, and we see about 5- or 6,000 people a year, 
as far as what we are trying to do is create a new image of who 
you are in the eyes of the employer. And just talking to our 
people about the impact of the record so they can explain to 
their families because, again, when you see a lot of situations 
of people having a record and have promised that they are going 
to do the right thing don't get the opportunity, as Tyrone 
said, then they go back to the old streets, the old things that 
they used to do and they wind up incarcerated again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt; You spoke briefly about legal liability
addressing that. Could you elaborate on that a bit?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;Yes. What we had to do, in the State of
Illinois, we, about 18 years ago, passed legislation, what we 
call a certificate of good conduct, which provides when the 
court looks at a person's rehabilitation, the court declares 
that person rehabilitated. And with that certificate of good 
conduct contains negligent liability protection.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;As far as doing this for the years I have been doing it, 
the biggest concern from employers were if I hire a person with 
a record and they do something on the job, I can get sued. So 
the negligent liability was critically important. And doing the 
healthcare work we were surprised, when we went to Ohio and we 
went to Texas, that they had negligent liability legislation on 
the books to kind of erase that fear that employers have so 
that they can look at the candidate, they can look past the 
fear.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;    What we are doing in Illinois is pushing forward negligent 
liability protection for all employers who hire people with 
criminal records, because that will eliminate that fear so they 
can get good people, so that people can get that job, transform 
themselves, their families, and then ultimately communities in 
which most people in Illinois with criminal records live in.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt; Maybe there could be some negligent
liability protection for Congress passing bad bills from time 
to time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[The prepared statement of Mr. Lowery follows:][GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Lowery "&gt; Yeah, that might help.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt; All right. I thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Davis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Davis"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DAVIS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. DAVIS"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. DAVIS"&gt;    Mr. Lowery, given the fact that I live in Chicago and the 
fact that Safer is based in Chicago, I am aware of the long 
history of engagement in this type of work. What has fascinated 
me the most has been the relationship developed with Johns 
Hopkins University Medical Center. Could you share a little bit 
more how you made that contact and how you decided that you 
would pursue the health industry as an area to explore?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;Okay. Thank you, Congressman. And again, I
would like to thank you for your part as far as making all of 
that possible. I was invited here a couple years ago at a 
Father's Day event, and I think with the featured Attorney 
General Holder, and in doing research for that event I saw a 
staggering number of 15 million jobs in healthcare, and I was 
like this is unbelievable. Cabrini Green Legal Aid, which is 
the leading criminal records advocate in the State of Illinois 
had called me about a lady who had a 30-year-old misdemeanor 
conviction and couldn't get a job as a CNA in a healthcare 
facility, and I said this is un-American.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;So when I came here and talked about the need for people--
for congressional members to go back to their communities, talk 
to healthcare entities because healthcare is the largest 
employer, fastest growing sector in this country. Congressman 
Davis does a workshop at the legislative annual caucus, and he 
featured Pamela Paulk from Johns Hopkins Hospital, who was the 
head of human resources at the time. When we heard Pamela talk 
about how she had been hiring--Hopkins had been hiring people 
with criminal records for the past 15 years, we said, well, 
wait a minute, we need to do this in Chicago.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;So we invited Hopkins to come to Chicago, and Pamela was so 
gracious to come. Congressman Davis came and joined the event. 
We got Chicago Urban League Cook County Board of Commissioners, 
and we had the first healthcare forum in the city of Chicago 
where we brought hospital CEOs, and hiring managers, to talk 
about an untapped workforce.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;We highlighted one of our former clients, Melody Young, who 
as a young mother addicted to drugs, had went to prison, came 
out, got a job in healthcare, but when the background check 
came back, she was let go. She continued to go to school, work 
on her clemency and pardon, and now she is a nurse with Great 
Lakes Naval for the Veterans Administration.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;When Melody told her story and her journey about redemption 
and challenges and opportunity saying that ``I am not a bad 
person, I made bad choices,'' she changed the face of who 
healthcare employers thought people with criminal records were. 
That allowed us to have the opportunity and open up hiring 
opportunities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;News came to Washington about what we had did and our 
national partner, National Employment Law Project, collaborated 
with us, so we did additional forums in Dallas, in Cleveland, 
and in Oakland, California. Now, we have healthcare employers 
as part of our consortium sending us open positions. What we 
have done is changed that image and opened up that opportunity. 
The opportunities when we were in Texas, the lady who has the 
consortium in Dallas, said, all the graduates in all the 
medical schools in Texas, we still do not have enough people to 
fill these positions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;    When looking at healthcare being a natural, and then just 
eliminating that barrier, getting those to see that people make 
mistakes, they are credentialed, there is protection, can we 
just have a basic American opportunity to work.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DAVIS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. DAVIS"&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. DAVIS"&gt;    And, Mr. Ferrens, listening to you was kind of like being 
in a church of God and Christ church and manna coming down from 
heaven, to be very honest about it. Your experience, your 
success really makes you a role model for individuals who have 
had similar circumstances. If you pinpointed one barrier, what 
would you say was the most difficult challenge to get beyond?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt; To pinpoint one, I think the most difficult
part for me, it wasn't even so much the training, it was 
cutting loose of people and things that I was accustomed to, 
people that surrounded me. When I decided I wanted to change my 
life and I was attending this program, I still lived in the 
community I used to get high in. I still lived in the community 
that I sold drugs in. I think breaking those relationships and 
stepping out, being strong enough to say I am not going back 
that route, was probably the most difficult part of that 
change.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DAVIS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. DAVIS"&gt;Thank you. Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. DAVIS"&gt;    And thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;    Ms. Sewell you are recognized.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. SEWELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ranking member.
This is a really timely subject, and I want to thank all of our 
panelists for being here today. I grew up in Selma, Alabama, 
and I have the opportunity now to represent Birmingham and 
Selma here in Congress, but I can tell you that the difference 
between Birmingham and the rural communities is vast, yet I 
represent both.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt;My first question is, how do we take programs like 
JumpStart, programs like Safer Foundation and scale them to 
smaller communities, rural communities?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt;I know, Mr. Chairman, you and I both are very passionate 
about rural communities and the systemic barriers to employment 
and--their systemic barriers and there's structural barriers, 
but in rural communities it is lack of transportation, it is, 
lack of skills, obviously, but also lack of economic 
opportunity. So as we see people graduating from these rural 
communities, they are not coming back, and they are becoming 
smaller and smaller. And this Nation was founded on small 
communities. And so I don't want to lose that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt;    My question to both you, Mr. Lowery, and you, Mr. 
Henderson, is how do we scale your kind of programs to small 
rural communities?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. HENDERSON&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt; Boy, that is a great question. I don't have
rural communities. We have suburbia. And I don't think that 
counts.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. SEWELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt; It doesn't count.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. HENDERSON&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt; I mean, what drives these programs are our
programs are driven by economic activity. There is a severe 
shortage of skilled workers in the construction industry 
nationwide, but we are at the epicenter where the Sagamores of 
the world and Johns Hopkins of the world are spending hundreds 
of millions of dollars annually. How that translates into--wow, 
I don't know. I wish I had some--it is a long way of saying I 
can't help. I don't know.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. SEWELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt; Mr. Lowery?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt; Well, what our experience has shown is that
then we also operate two work release centers for the Illinois 
Department of Corrections where we do the training, and we look 
at the areas of high employer needs. Because again, to 
eliminate the stigma of hiring a person with records, the need 
has to be tremendous. So we collaborated, and we had a program 
a few years ago where we had job training, computer training in 
every State prison in the State of Illinois, all 27, and we 
collaborated with community colleges to do the training in 
those areas.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. SEWELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt;That is a very good point. My time is almost
up, and I really want to commend Mr. Ferrens. You really are at 
the face of what is possible if you want to change your life, 
and you have the resources and the opportunity to do so and the 
will to do so, so I want to commend you for that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt;Unemployment in my district--the average unemployment in my 
district is 9 percent, even though the national average is 4, 
so it is almost double. And we have a job fair every year, and 
we alternate urban and rural because I have both in my 
district. The first one we had was in Birmingham and it drew 
over 5,000 people. People were wrapped around in a very hot 
August day around the civic center, showing to many of the 
folks who think that people don't want to work that they do 
want to work. People do want to work. I think that there is an 
indomitable spirit and that nothing is more important than the 
dignity of knowing that you can take care of yourself and your 
family.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt;    And so my next question, or last question really, is to 
you, Mr. Ferrens. One doesn't walk this road alone, and were 
there any Federal programs that helped--that were wraparound 
services that helped you while you were being trained through 
JumpStart?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt; None that I was aware of.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. SEWELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt; If you could sort of figure--if you could have
a magic wand and sort of help all of us understand second 
chances, what would you say to those who don't believe that 
people deserve second chances?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt; I can tell you JumpStart graduates, I can
speak from my perspective.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. SEWELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;And on the job we operate at a whole other
level. I mean, the level of gratitude we have for someone 
giving us the opportunity to perform. There is no reason for 
you to hire me. So when you give me a job, you know, JumpStart 
graduates are genuinely grateful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;    We had a MICA job that was behind, it is a school, 
education. They opened 7 days a week for us to work. My company 
has over 100 employees. There were probably 17 that showed up 7 
days a week for 4 weeks. Nine of the 14 of the 17 were 
JumpStart graduates. My company only has 14 JumpStart graduates 
on its staff. You know, it was a chance for us to show our 
commitment to our company and thank them for hiring us.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. SEWELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Ms. SEWELL"&gt; And to your community. Yes. Thank you. Well, I
commend you and thank you for being here today, all of you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;Mrs. Walorski.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;Mrs. WALORSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;Well, I am all fired up listening to your story because it 
is, I think, the answer and the solution we are looking for.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;And I kind of want to address this to you, Mr. Orrell, just 
kind of like the bird's eye view of just a couple of things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;One was you talked about in your written testimony, Mr. 
Orrell, about the need for a consistent message about the 
socioeconomic and personal importance of work and self-
efficiency. You trace it back to the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, 
and I want to go a little bit further than that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;A 1935 State of the Union Address President Franklin 
Roosevelt said, ``Work must be found for able-bodied but 
destitute workers.'' Posters for his works progress 
administration blared in big letters all over the country: 
``Work promotes confidence.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;And I want to get to you also, Mr. Ferrens, after I ask you 
this question, and I know the how is different in today's 
culture, but FDR was also a big believer in the idea that those 
that can work must work, and we must discourage sitting on the 
sidelines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;In my district in northern Indiana, the home of the RV 
industry, today, right now, in just one county we have 30,000 
jobs available. We are at full employment because of about 1.7 
percent unemployment, meaning 1.7 of the people are not going 
to work. Thirty thousand jobs today. There are plenty of 
reasons for this. I hear it every day from everybody and their 
brother. They can't hire workers that can't pass the drug test. 
And this is in relation to this latest onslaught of opioid 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;    We have looked at this at several layers in my State, the 
Governor--we are engaged now with a task force. Drugs are in my 
State and the Federal level as well looking at our State of 
Indiana. These opioid deaths now are being called deaths of 
despair, but there are still tens of thousands of jobs 
available. And I guess, Mr. Orrell, from the big picture can 
you give us some perspective on the relationship between 
unemployment and the rapid rise of opioid addiction in our 
country? And then does anybody have any conclusive evidence to 
determine is this a causal relationship and then followed up 
by, if so, does unemployment lead to addiction or is it vice 
versa?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. ORRELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;So it is a complex interplay of factors. I
highly recommend the study by Anne Case out of Princeton 
University on this, who she and her husband coined this phrase, 
``the deaths of despair.'' She really looked at after you tease 
out all the factors that could contribute to the opioid 
addiction, what you get is a cumulative impact on people's 
lives that is founded in unemployment. It is not only 
unemployment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;    Mrs. WALORSKI. Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. ORRELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;It is breakdown of families. It is the
dissolution of other community institutions. It is problems in 
marriage. It is all sorts of things that feed into it. But 
after you control for all of that, you don't really see the 
rise in the kind of deaths of despair that we have seen until 
you see the deindustrialization of the American economy and the 
loss of those jobs. Unemployment, they argue, is really at the 
base of this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Ferrens, thanks also for your story. 
But, you walked through this world, maybe not just with 
opioids, but certainly drug addiction. And so for you, you have 
already said kind of how you got turned into and got turned 
around into something else when you changed your mind. But as 
you kind of look out over the scale of the map today, do you 
think it is also the same kind of--is it an unemployment issue 
that turns your head around to say I need to be responsible, I 
can do this?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;    I am thinking of the people in Indiana right now, 30,000 
jobs and, technically, people still talking about there is no 
jobs, there are no good jobs. Do you have a perspective on 
that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;It is hard for me to fathom that situation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;    Mrs. WALORSKI. Oh, I know.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;You know, from the inner city it is always a
lack of opportunities. But I know in my walk, drug use starts 
earlier in life than unemployment before you even start looking 
for a job.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;    Mrs. WALORSKI. Right. Exactly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;You know, so I would probably go with the drug
use leads to unemployment, just from my perspective in the 
inner city. And a lot of it is the single parent homes and 
the--I guess you would call it depression. You know, it is hard 
to look at your kid--as a father, you have single parent homes 
because you don't want to be reminded of your failure. It is 
hard when you can't put sneakers on your kid's feet to be in 
that kid's life. It is much easier to turn and run because you 
are unemployed, rather than stay in that kid's life and feel 
like a complete failure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;It is a big picture, and you turn to drugs to deal with 
feeling like a failure. It is far more big than what I can 
offer you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;Mrs. WALORSKI. I appreciate your perspective.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt;    And thank you gentlemen, and thank you, Mr. Chairman. I 
yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bishop&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Bishop"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. BISHOP&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the
panel for being here and sharing your time and your testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"&gt;    Mr. Orrell, I was wondering, much of the success of a 
program like this has to do with changing the culture in our 
country of basing success on who can send their kid to a four-
year--or to a college to further their career. How do we deal 
with that? How do we go from a society that puts so much 
emphasis on college only to come out on the other side with 
huge debt and no job? How do we transition to a position where 
we actually encourage folks to use their talents that they have 
today and transition right into the workforce? What is the 
message--what can government do to encourage that kind of 
mindset?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. ORRELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;I think it is a great question as to how we
encourage young people to think about non-four-year 
opportunities. The reality is that everybody in the economy now 
and, in the future, is going to need some sort of postsecondary 
training. What we need to do, is make young people aware of the 
opportunities. There are good livings to be had in the trades, 
in technical fields, in manufacturing, in healthcare, that 
don't require four-year degrees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;    So encouraging people, encouraging youth to understand, 
providing the information, here is what is available to you. 
Did you know it is not uncommon these days for welders to make 
$100,000 a year? Did you know that there are manufacturing jobs 
that will start you out at 40-, $45,000 a year and with great 
career pathways? And you won't have to have the $80,000 in debt 
that you get out of a bachelor's degree for something you may 
not be able to use.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. BISHOP&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"&gt;Interesting. It is a conundrum that we want to
put emphasis on higher education, but at the same time there 
are some folks that just do better, as Mr. Ferrens indicated, 
outside of school, hands on, and that is the kind of thing that 
public policy should support and not look down upon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"&gt;    I wonder if, Mr. Henderson, you might be able to comment on 
whether or not you think that the groups, the projects like you 
have been working on, Project JumpStart, government, community 
colleges, talk to each other. Do we talk outcomes based to 
suggest how we can best work together? And if not, how can we 
encourage that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. HENDERSON&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;It is a challenge. We work with the
community colleges. We work with the public schools. Everybody 
has their own fiefdom. Everybody has their own set of 
objectives they have to meet, and sometimes they feel like in 
order to get it, in order to get funding, they have got to do 
it unilaterally and would it make sense to bring other people 
into the program? And I especially see this with the community 
colleges. They are an important partner for us, but they have 
their own dealing with funding, dealing with changing student 
body.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt;    I just want to tag on real quickly what the gentleman was 
saying about school. Change the way you incentivize and judge 
and hold principals and guidance counselors accountable. Give 
accredited industry-recognized training the same way that they 
give AP tests and four-year college degrees and you will see a 
change.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. BISHOP&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"&gt;A very solid recommendation. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Ferrens, your testimony, your story is really quite 
inspiring and compelling. I am wondering if you might be able 
to tell me, you drew my interest with regard to criminal 
conviction. Mr. Lowery also spoke on the subject, and how that 
is an impediment to your future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"&gt;    Has there been any effort afoot to try and create an 
expungement process so that you can expunge your record and not 
have to go through life with that anchor around your neck?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt; I have attempted in the past. There was a lot
of bureaucracy as far as regards to your last offense being a 
conviction, whether it can be expunged or not. It just got 
extremely frustrating for me. And it bothers me, because I feel 
as though my son and my children are still paying for that 
mistake, in regards to the opportunities that I have that would 
affect their lives and our living situation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. BISHOP&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"&gt;The purpose of expungement and the reason why I
raise it is because it is supposed to give people like you, who 
have proven themselves to society, who are not likely to be a 
recidivists, who are productive members of society, a second 
chance. I have always supported, and I think it makes sense to 
support public policy that encourages that kind of fatherhood 
and citizenship going forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"&gt;    So I appreciate your testimony and I think it sheds light 
on an important need in public policy in this country.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;I just wanted to jump in for a second as far
as--in Illinois we just passed the largest expansion of sealing 
in the history of the country. Where before you had only 9 
felony convictions that can be sealed. Now there are hundreds 
that can be sealed after the waiting period, after the 
appropriate rehabilitation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;    I think the biggest change that needs to happen, and I know 
Congressman Davis had introduced Federal legislation about 
sealing the record, but the biggest thing is the perception of 
who a person with a criminal record is. And, again, 
rehabilitation is not a made-up word. People turn their lives 
around. Given the opportunity to turn their lives around, the 
basic dignity of work, there has to be a commitment and a 
messaging from the Federal Government to allow people second 
chances to just basically work. And I think that will go a long 
way with resolving issues, labor place, and all the other 
associated ills that we are facing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt; Thank you. Mr. Reed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REED&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt;Thank you, Chairman. And thank you to our
panelists for the input. And I want to focus my opportunity 
here to really get beyond the data, and I spent a lot of time 
measuring the data, looking at an evidence-based perspective. 
But to have a conversation with you, Mr. Ferrens, primarily 
about the human experience that you went through. I, too, am 
the son of a single mother. Father passed when I was 2. I have 
11 older brothers and sisters, and I was inspired by her to 
lead the life that I have led in order to sit here as a Member 
of Congress, relatively coming from nothing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt;I am interested in getting to--sometimes of a debate that 
we have here in Washington, D.C., that I really try to look at 
it from the perspective of the other side of the aisle. When it 
comes to the conversation about work requirements, when it 
comes to the policies that we are trying to advocate for 
purposes of giving people the opportunity to get an education, 
volunteer in their community, to go to school, to get that to 
work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt;And sometimes I am chastised for advocating for that type 
of policy. That I am heartless. That I am clueless. That I 
don't know the difficulty that that represents in a human 
being's life as they go through that requirement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt;And so sometimes I also have a conversation about the 
unintended consequences of what are good faith initiatives by 
many people here in Washington, D.C. when it comes to providing 
cash welfare or government assistance. And I don't think there 
is anyone here who is fundamentally opposed to that. But I want 
to understand the human psyche, because we experienced it in 
our family when we relied on government programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt;    Is there any consequence to you as a human being when you 
are given a government program, a government check, as opposed 
to earning that government check or earning that resource that 
you bring to your family? Did you ever experience any of that 
in your life experience, and could you share with me that 
story?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. FERRENS&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. FERRENS"&gt; Yes. I have been a recipient of welfare, food
stamps, a lot of government assisted programs. And there is no 
comparison. None whatsoever. It is innate that as a man you 
want to be the provider, the protector of your home. You can't 
describe what it is to earn something versus just being given 
something. I would have much preferred someone giving me or 
exposing me to a program like JumpStart, rather than me getting 
a check on the third. There is no pride that comes in that. 
There is no appreciation for it. There is no value in it. 
Anything that comes easy you don't appreciate. I wouldn't 
compare the two.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REED&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt;I appreciate that experience because that is
exactly what I have heard as I travel around the country and 
when we have taken initiative on welfare reform. The dignity, 
the pride of earning that resource, even if it is a government 
program. That you are showing up and you are volunteering in 
your community, you are giving back to that community. I have 
seen such dignity as a result of that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt;    Would you, Mr. Lowery or Mr. Ferrens, would you agree that 
sometimes what we do with the well-intentioned purpose of what 
we are trying to do may have an unintended consequence that 
gets to the psyche, the dignity, and the ability of an 
individual then therefore to achieve success because they have 
lost that dignity, they have lost that pride, they have lost 
that innate experience that Mr. Ferrens just testified to.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt; I think what we really have to understand is
that government assistance is not a career pathway. In the 
State of Illinois, I think a person is entitled to a Link card, 
for food assistance. I think that is only 140 bucks a month. So 
the fallacy of a person is depending on a $140----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REED&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt;Well, Mr. Lowery, I am not talking about the
dependency on that $140. I am talking about the dignity that is 
associated with receiving that Link card for nothing in return 
for it. What Mr. Ferrens just testified to is a human 
experience that I think we should advocate for here in 
Washington, which is that even at the $150, just the simple 
request of having an individual volunteer in their community, 
to earn that card, gives that person dignity so when they stand 
in front of their children, when they stand in front of their 
wives or their spouses or their husbands, they say, you know 
what, I have given something in return. I have earned it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt;    To me, that is a fundamental policy shift that we need 
respect. And this isn't about dependency. This isn't about 
having a discussion about what is the level of resource to 
give. We can have that discussion all day long. It is about a 
fundamental policy that rewards the dignity of work, the pride 
that comes with it, and not destroying the human psyche, even 
though we are very well-intentioned with the purpose of the 
programs in which we are advocating for.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;I think, again, the biggest thing, and I don't
have time to share my experiences as far as being a person with 
a record, the denial of opportunity, even with a college 
degree, having been a director of the highest rated public 
housing drug elimination program in the country. I lost that 
job. I had to work that earn fair job to get that assistance 
from a college degree with a staff of 75 and a budget of $5 
million.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;    I was chopping jerk chicken and vegetables in a Jamaican 
restaurant just to fulfill that work requirement. But, again, 
what we have to understand is that people want to work 
because----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REED&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt; I agree with that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt; There is dignity in work, and when I go into a
facility----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REED&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt; My time has expired.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt; The biggest challenge that people--can I get a
job? Can I get a job? Can I get a job?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REED&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt; I understand.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;So if the Government can kind of be a drum
major as far as second chances, encouraging employers with 
incentives, with negligent liability, to give people an 
opportunity to work. Because, as the gentleman said, out of his 
program, the people who work 7 days a week were the people who 
had records, who had a loyalty, a commitment, who honored that 
second chance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt;    I think we are hurting ourselves by denying people that 
second chance, because you have a workforce of millions of 
people around the country.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REED&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. REED"&gt; Well, I appreciate that--my time has expired. Mr.
Ferrens, thank you for that human experience and your 
successes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt; Thank you. Mr. Reichert.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REICHERT&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;I thank the witnesses for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;And, Mr. Ferrens, congratulations on your life and your 
success. We all have challenges that we go through.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;I come from a family that struggled as we were growing up. 
Ran away from home, lived in the street, lived in an old car 
when I was 16 years old.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;Some stories--you know, mine is bad enough, domestic 
violence, that kind of stuff, but everybody has a cross to 
bear. And we all go through struggles, some a lot worse than 
others. But we all deserve second chances. That is what the 
Almighty God who created us tells us, right? We are all 
forgiven and deserve a second chance, and I strongly believe 
that myself.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;When you look at these reasons as to why there is 
unemployment. I just looked down the list here, if I can read 
them off very quickly, and I hope I can get through some of 
this stuff and get to my question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;Number one, lack of post-secondary education and training 
resulting in lower wages. Growing dependency on public benefit 
programs. High levels of opioid dependency and drug abuse. 
Rising prevalence of criminal records, along with unmet child 
support orders. Absence of available jobs in many depressed 
communities. Weakening of social or cultural norms that expect 
able-bodied men to work. And the list goes on and on and on. 
You guys have a big job.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;But your experiences that you just shared with us are the 
reason why some of these programs are successful. God makes us 
go through these challenges, right? To help those that are 
about to go through the same challenges, go down a different 
path. And thank you, gentlemen, for doing that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;I work with a group back in Seattle called DADS, it is 
Divine Alternatives for Dad Services. And Marvin and Jeanette 
are the husband and wife who co-founded this organization, and 
they are personal friends of mine. Marvin won't be ashamed and 
Jeannette won't be ashamed for me to share with you that Marvin 
was a pimp and Jeanette was a prostitute. I was an on-time law 
enforcement officer, 33 years, and worked the Green River 
serial murder case, and worked with those people on the street 
for 19 years day in and day out. These people I call my 
friends. They have turned their life around, and they are 
helping men be fathers and get jobs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;As I listen to the comments from our witnesses today, it 
makes me think about the consequences for families and 
children, for the United States, of working-aged men not 
participating in the work force. It is a huge consequence for 
our whole society. For these men, the possibility of being 
unable to financially support a family, as you mentioned, or 
contribute to the upbringing of their children has a negative 
ripple effect on the entire country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;And sometimes what I get frustrated with in my law 
enforcement career is working with the community. And Marvin 
and Jeanette have done a wonderful job of bringing in the 
faith-based community which they are excited about helping. And 
bringing other social services surrounding--you get the 
families involved, if you can.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;I have two adopted grandchildren, drug addicted babies, 
that are now 14 and 15 years old. They were 3 months old when 
my daughter adopted them. They have a wonderful life ahead of 
them. But I find that these organizations don't work together. 
They are disjointed. They are inefficient. They are struggling 
and fighting over the same dollars. And we need to invest in 
those programs that can come together, work together, right, 
and recognize the goal for all of us and not compete against 
the same dollars that, you know, another effort is competing 
for.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;So, for all of you, I think all of you are coming from the 
same place in wanting to help, as we are here on this panel. 
What is the one thing? For me it is, you know, it goes back to 
family, to responsibility, accountability and faith, to be 
honest with you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;What is the one specific policy, though, that you could all 
point to that would be the one thing you think that we can do 
to help you accomplish the tremendous task that you are all 
involved in now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt;    Is there one thing that just pops in your mind. The one 
thing that maybe worked in your life, Mr. Ferrens, or maybe it 
was JumpStart. It can't be just money. What is it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. HENDERSON&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt; Just real quick, we have seen it in our
program, it is that role model. I grew up in a house where I 
saw dad go to work everyday. That is what dads do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REICHERT&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt; Yep, it was my football coach, my
grandfather----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. HENDERSON&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt; If I go in the neighborhood and my dad
doesn't go to work or the neighbor's dad doesn't go to work, I 
don't know what dads are supposed to do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REICHERT&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt; Yeah.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. HENDERSON&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. HENDERSON"&gt; We are trying to replicate that in a small
way with JumpStart, but that role model is huge.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REICHERT&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt; Yeah. Good. Anybody else?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. ORRELL&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;Yeah, I would echo that. I think you have seen
it on the panel here today. What you need are lighthouses of 
success at the family level, the individual level, and then at 
the community level. You know, you need to have an example of 
people succeeding against a lot of barriers that they face, the 
communities face, the individuals face.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. ORRELL"&gt;    Helping them succeed in that so it becomes plausible then 
to other people in the community that there is a way out here. 
We don't have to accept where we are. Programs like JumpStart. 
Programs that we are involved with, ICF also involves more--you 
know, are really about trying to create those lighthouses of 
hope within the community.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REICHERT&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt; Yeah. Well, if we can help in any way, we
can, let us know. I know you will. But the work really happens 
where you all are, and thank you. God speed. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. LOWERY&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. LOWERY"&gt; Thank you for your service and commitment to
community.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. REICHERT&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"&gt; Thank you, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman SMITH&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Reichert. And thank you to
all of our witnesses, our panelists, I really appreciate 
sharing your insight and expertise and your perspective. It is 
inspiring to see the difference that you have made in 
yourselves and your community. I just can't say thank you 
enough, and look forward to perhaps hearing more in the future 
about the successes that you have brought about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;Please be advised that members will have two weeks to 
submit written questions to be answered later in writing. Those 
questions and your answers will be made part of the formal 
hearing record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;With that, the subcommittee stands adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;[Whereupon, at 3:15 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Chairman SMITH"&gt;[Public Submissions for the Record Follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
