                              ----------                              
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in 
room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Paul A. Gosar 
[Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding.
    Present: Representatives Gosar, Lamborn, Wittman, Thompson, 
Tipton, Graves, Hice, Cheney, Bishop (ex officio), Lowenthal, 
Tsongas, Beyer, Soto, Barragan, Velazquez, and Grijalva (ex 
officio).
    Mr. Gosar. The Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources 
will come to order.
    The Subcommittee is meeting today to hear testimony on a 
discussion draft titled ``Enhancing State Management of Federal 
Lands and Waters Act.''
    Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at 
the hearing are limited to the Chairman, the Ranking Minority 
Member, and the Vice Chair. This will allow us to hear from our 
witnesses sooner and helps Members keep to their schedules.
    Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that all other Members' 
opening statements made be part of the hearing record if they 
are submitted to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5 p.m. today.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    I now recognize myself for a 5-minute opening statement.
&lt;/option&gt;

    Mr. Gosar. Today, the Subcommittee will discuss a written 
discussion draft that continues a conversation about the 
relationship between the Federal Government and the states most 
immediately affected by the development of federally-owned 
minerals.
    This conversation began last fall, after the Department of 
the Interior announced a robust draft proposed schedule of 
offshore lease sales, which included 47 lease sales in nearly 
all regions of the American Outer Continental Shelf.
    Many coastal governors, municipalities, and congressional 
delegations vocally expressed opposition to the plan, and 
attempted to pass certain measures that discourage or prevent 
mineral development on the federally-owned Outer Continental 
Shelf.
    While states are highly involved in the offshore lease 
planning process, they do not have a veto power over lease 
sales. Congress has seen various bills and amendments 
attempting to impose a moratorium on OCS leasing, essentially 
imposing the localized will on a nationally-owned, widely 
enjoyed benefit. What seems to be lost in these initiatives, 
however, is an acknowledgment that such attempts to strand 
Federal assets comes at the expense of the American taxpayer.
    The ideas presented today increase the state's role in 
Federal mineral management, while indemnifying the taxpayer if 
the state chooses to leave the Federal mineral undeveloped.
    Both the onshore and offshore concepts presented attempt to 
increase the role of states in Federal mineral management by 
creating additional opportunities for states to facilitate or 
inhibit mineral development, while ensuring the American 
taxpayer realizes the value of the nationally-owned minerals.
    Title I of this bill will allow states to assume exclusive 
jurisdiction over oil and gas development on specific parcels 
of federally-owned land. With the approval of the Secretary of 
the Interior, states may choose to increase or decrease 
production, or cease production on these parcels altogether.
    Each state with existing onshore energy production has a 
robust regulatory framework for managing energy development. 
Allowing states to apply their management practices to Federal 
lands will eliminate duplicative regulatory requirements, 
reduce uncertainty for operators, and make these lands 
competitive with state and private lands once again.
    If a state increases production on Federal lands, the state 
will receive 60 percent of the mineral revenues compared to 50 
percent currently provided under the Mineral Leasing Act. 
However, if a state reduces production, that state will receive 
a reduced share of 20 percent and must pay a lost production 
fee to the Federal Treasury. If federally-owned lands within a 
state contain economically recoverable oil and gas resources, 
they have the potential to generate revenue for the Federal 
Government. These lands are owned by the public, meaning that 
keeping these resources off the market represents a cost to 
taxpayers nationwide. If a state chooses to forego development, 
the state will be required to offset the loss in revenue to the 
Federal Treasury.
    Under Title II, coastal states will be empowered to make 
intelligent decisions about allowing or prohibiting development 
in Federal waters. The offshore proposal allows states to 
consider development on a detailed, block-by-block basis. To 
make informed decisions about management, DOI is directed to 
consolidate and supplement geologic and geophysical data on the 
OCS, and to use this information to plan lease sales and 
determine the value of the minerals beneath our oceans.
    Coastal states are then offered the right to determine 
whether lease blocks are included in a final sale. The more 
blocks a state allows to proceed to a final sale, the higher 
the revenue sharing percentage that state receives from 
revenues generated from the development off its coast. Should a 
state choose to withhold the block from a sale, the state must 
indemnify the U.S. Treasury for the value lost to the taxpayer.
    We recognize that the current draft of the bill contains 
several flaws. For instance, it does not yet include the 
equitable redrawing of states' administrative boundary lines, 
nor are the calculations of reasonable indemnifications to the 
Federal Government and revenues to the state finalized. We will 
continue to engage all affected stakeholders on this complex, 
conceptual proposal, and we invite commentary and suggestions 
to ensure the conversation is inclusive and well-informed.
    Once again, these concepts seek to start a conversation 
about the relationship between states and Federal offshore 
development. In the end, these proposals empower states to 
allow their decisions to result in financial benefits or costs 
to their residents--furthering the notion of federalism.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Prepared Statement of the Hon. Paul A. Gosar, Chairman, Subcommittee on 
                      Energy and Mineral Resources
    Today, the Subcommittee will discuss a discussion draft that

in financial benefits or costs to the their residents--furthering the 
notion of federalism.
                                 ______
    Mr. Gosar. I now recognize the gentleman from California, 
Mr. Lowenthal, the Ranking Member for his 5 minutes.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you to the witnesses for being here, and I hope 
our fourth witness comes soon.
    It is Groundhog Day again in the Committee as we consider 
yet another bill that prioritizes the oil and gas industry over 
everyday Americans.
    This discussion draft makes a clear statement: our shared 
public lands and waters are only worth the oil and gas that we 
can wring out of them. Nothing else is worth anything, not the 
ability to hunt, to fish, to bike, to canoe, or simply to enjoy 
our treasured natural places. Under this legislation, those are 
all worthless.
    Our spectacular landscapes, our wild areas, our magnificent 
beaches, and our oceans--under this legislation, they are all 
worthless. Only oil and gas is worth anything. And the bill 
would reward states that get onboard and want to drill more, 
while harshly punishing states that prioritize conservation, 
protection, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, or 
their tourism economy, and it also punishes states wanting a 
clean environment.
    Title I of this bill would hand public land management over 
to oil and gas companies in each state. We have seen language 
like this before in the Subcommittee, but we have never seen 
such a blatant expression of disdain for our existing laws and 
the public's right to have a say about what is going on.
    The bill entirely waives the National Environmental Policy 
Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, the Endangered Species 
Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act for oil and gas 
activities.
    In addition, it says that when our states take over, there 
would be no ability to protect other uses of the land or to 
limit where oil and gas drilling occurs. And, of course, states 
are given incentives to take over and drill more--an additional 
11 percent of the oil and gas revenues if they do. In effect, 
this title is a bribe for states to take public lands out of 
the public's hands.
    It might be hard to believe, but Title II of the bill is 
arguably even more extreme. Under the guise of local 
management, the discussion draft would allow the Federal 
Government to extort enormous sums of money from coastal states 
that want to protect their oceans and beaches from the threat 
of offshore drilling. While the concept is indeed novel, it is 
also reprehensible.
    If a state wants to prevent a lease sale in its entirety, 
they would have to pay potentially billions of dollars, or 
more, to the Federal Government.
    Due in part to the ambiguous wording of the bill, it is 
hard to determine the exact ransom amount, but estimates 
underscore the proposal's absurdity. My home state of 
California could easily have to pay--and I am going to state 
this clearly--over a trillion dollars for a 10-year reprieve.
    We know the Administration likes to play favorites. Well, 
this bill would give them a chance to bankrupt blue states by 
threatening to hold lease sales off their coasts. If a state 
pays up, their beaches are safe. But if not--hey, beautiful 
coastline you have there, you have a beautiful coastline? 
Wouldn't it be a shame if something happened to it?
    If Title I is the bribe, Title II is the shakedown. Coastal 
tourism and recreation economies generate billions of dollars 
and employ millions of people. states recognize both the 
financial and social value of coastal resources and know oil 
and gas development are not worth the risk.
    I hope this discussion draft is more about trying to make a 
point than making a serious effort to legislate.
    I understand some in the Majority see a double standard, 
where coastal states get their way on Federal waters while 
other states don't have the ability to manage Federal land on 
their own, but that argument is flawed. Coastal states don't 
get to unilaterally decide what happens in Federal waters.
    We make our case to the Secretary. It is a strong case that 
our coastal economies are too valuable to risk them for a few 
barrels of oil, and we are backed by a majority of our 
constituents, but the Secretary is the one who ultimately 
decides what to lease. And states with public land also get to 
weigh in on how the land-use plans are developed.
    The ideas behind this bill are flawed, and its enactment 
would be disastrous for everyone who uses or enjoys our public 
lands, our beaches, and our oceans.
    I thank the witnesses for being here, and I yield back.

    &lt;option&gt; ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, CENTER FOR FREE MARKETS AND 
   REGULATORY REFORM, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION, WASHINGTON, DC
    Mr. Loris. Chairman Bishop, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member 
Lowenthal, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank 
you for this opportunity to testify on the Enhancing State 
Management of Natural Resources on Federal Lands and Waters 
Act.
    My name is Nick Loris, and I am the Herbert and Joyce 
Morgan Fellow at The Heritage Foundation. The views I express 
in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as 
representing any official position of The Heritage Foundation.
    Both proponents and opponents of energy production on 
Federal lands and waters have expressed frustration over the 
current leasing and permitting process. Proponents of increased 
energy access have long derided decisions by previous 
administrations to lock up resources and make it painstakingly 
difficult to secure and use a lease.
    More recently, opponents of offshore drilling in coastal 
states have voiced concerns that offshore oil and gas 
production have too much environmental risk and would adversely 
affect other sectors of their state's economy. This mutual 
dissatisfaction with the status quo presents an opportunity for 
change.
    A fundamental problem with the current approach is that the 
Federal ownership and control of minerals have taken decision 
rights away from the states. Federal ownership results in 
static management to very dynamic energy markets. In this 
regard, I would like to make several observations.
    First, the benefits of active state engagement with regard 
to energy production.
    Offshore--even under the current broken system, Louisiana 
is a wonderful success story of a state that has robust oil and 
gas production but also strong commercial fishing, seafood, and 
tourism industries. With more than 80 percent of water-borne 
rigs off the state's coast and representing 30 percent of the 
commercial fishing in the continental United States, Louisiana 
has long demonstrated these industries work harmoniously.
    Onshore--states have had remarkable success overseeing 
national resource development, both economically and 
environmentally. States process applications for permits to 
drill in days or weeks whereas the Federal Government takes 
several months. Where states have authority over the regulatory 
process, oil and gas production has soared.
    This energy revolution has been a tremendous boon for these 
states' economies and for the economy at large. Lower energy 
bills have reduced costs for businesses across the country and 
put money back into the bank accounts of hard-working American 
families.
    The draft legislation would make important reforms to 
transfer responsibilities to the states for energy extraction 
on Federal lands. This will result in more accountable and 
effective management.
    Reducing bureaucratic delay will result in an industry that 
is more responsive to price changes, creating more investment 
in jobs in the process. The second observation is the benefits 
the bill would generate by aligning economic and environmental 
incentives. When policies are site-specific, situation-
specific, and employ local knowledge, they encourage better 
care of the environment and natural resources by putting them 
in the hands of people who have immediate stake in wise 
management.
    Another significant feature of the draft bill is that it 
would properly align financial incentives for the states. 
Offering states a greater percentage of the revenue collected 
would encourage states to seriously consider the economic 
benefits of onshore and offshore energy production.
    In fact, as recently as 2013, both Democratic Senators from 
Virginia offered legislation to open parts of the Atlantic to 
offshore development. A critical component of their legislation 
was to ensure that Virginia received royalty revenues similar 
to states operating in the Gulf Coast. Under this draft bill, 
should states pursue offshore development, they would capture 
an even greater share of the revenue.
    My third observation is possible congressional action 
beyond the scope of this draft. Congress could go even further 
by applying the same reforms to all energy investments on 
Federal lands and waters.
    States should have the same incentives and choices the 
draft legislation provides to oil and gas for all other energy 
projects, whether it is a solar farm in Nevada or offshore wind 
in the Atlantic.
    Congress should also consider opening lease options to all 
interested parties. Under the current policy, only energy 
companies can bid on tracts of land and the Federal Government 
requires leaseholders to demonstrate intent to develop these 
resources.
    Opening up the auction would invite more competition and 
help truly assess the value of the land and the resources 
beneath it. A more inclusive bidding process could also create 
more economic and environmental cooperation. An environmental 
organization could pair up with a grazer to bid on a parcel of 
land, or an energy company could coordinate with a 
conservationist group to use the land in which both parties 
benefit.
    In conclusion, policy reform should open access to our 
abundance of resources, establish the framework for competitive 
markets to respond to price signals, empower the states, and 
protect the American taxpayers.
    I commend the Committee for introducing this draft 
legislation that would improve the current process by engaging 
the appropriate stakeholders and better aligning incentives for 
economic development and environmental protection.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt; Prepared Statement of Nicolas Loris, Herbert &amp;amp; Joyce Morgan Research 
                    Fellow, The Heritage Foundation
    My name is Nicolas Loris and I am the Research Manager in Energy 
and Environment and Herbert &amp;amp; Joyce Morgan Research Fellow at The 
Heritage Foundation. The views I express in this testimony are my own, 
and should not be construed as representing any official position of 
The Heritage Foundation.
    I want to thank the members of the Committee on Natural Resources' 
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;discuss enhancing state management of natural resources on Federal 
lands and waters.
    Both proponents and opponents of increased access to natural 
resource extraction on Federal lands and waters have expressed 
frustration over the leasing and permitting process. Proponents have 
long derided the decisions by previous administrations to lock up 
resources or make it painstakingly difficult to secure and use a lease. 
More recently, several coastal states responded to the latest 
Department of the Interior (DOI) offshore drilling proposal by voicing 
concerns that oil and gas production would have possible environmental 
risks and negative impacts on other sectors of their respective state's 
economy.
    Dissatisfaction from both parties presents an opportunity to 
improve the current system. Rather than have a system subject to the 
whims of whoever is in charge, successful, comprehensive reform should 
accomplish four objectives: (1) create a system that enables the energy 
industry to respond more quickly to rapidly changing market conditions; 
(2) involve states more directly in decision making; (3) protect the 
American taxpayer; and (4) align incentives for energy production and 
environmental protection.
     the enhancing state management of federal lands and waters act
    The Enhancing State Management of Federal Lands and Waters Act is a 
discussion draft that would amend the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) and the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to empower states to have 
more control over the leasing, permitting, and regulations of oil and 
gas production. Title I addresses onshore oil and gas development. If 
enacted, a state would apply to establish enhanced management regions 
that would authorize the state to develop energy resources on Federal 
land that is not Indian land, part of the National Park System, the 
National Wildlife Refuge System, or a congressionally designated area.
    The legislation would allow states to develop programs that satisfy 
all applicable Federal laws required to produce energy on Federal 
lands. Therefore, states would have complete control of their energy 
programs. In the event that an enhanced management region generates 
more oil and gas production than the average of the previous 5 fiscal 
years, states receive a greater percentage of the revenue accrued from 
bonus bids, rentals, and royalties. If non-market factors yield less 
production in an enhanced management region, the Secretary of Interior 
can revoke authority or assess a lost production fee.
    Title II of the discussion draft addresses offshore oil and gas 
development. The legislation would direct the Interior Secretary to 
conduct geological and geophysical mapping of the National Outer 
Continental Shelf (OCS) to establish a better estimate of oil and gas 
reserves off the U.S. coastline. In addition, the draft would authorize 
a state to approve or disapprove of each lease block offered in the 
DOI's lease sale if the area is within the state's administrative 
boundaries. If a state approves of all of the blocks in a lease sale, 
the state would receive 50 percent of the revenues from bonus bids, 
rentals, and royalties. If a state disapproves of lease blocks, the 
state would pay a fee to the Federal Government to compensate the 
taxpayer for lost revenues. The number of lease blocks a state 
disapproves of would determine the payment a state would make to the 
U.S. Treasury.
           the importance of energy production and federalism
    The Enhancing State Management of Federal Lands and Waters Act and 
the outcome of a January 2018 meeting between Secretary of the Interior 
Ryan Zinke and Florida Governor Rick Scott (R) prompts an important 
question about federalism and states' rights in the context of energy 
production. Florida currently has a legislative ban on oil and gas 
production off the Florida coast until 2022.\1\ Shortly after the 
Department of the Interior released its Draft Proposed Program (DPP) 
for the leasing of Federal lands under the National Outer Continental 
Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019-2024, Secretary Zinke met 
with Governor Scott.

    Afterward Zinke tweeted that Florida would have no new oil and gas 
platforms off its coast, citing Governor Scott's position that the 
Sunshine State is heavily dependent on tourism for its economy.\2\ The 
announcement prompted policy makers in other coastal states to request 
their own exemptions.\3\ Secretary Zinke expressed intent to meet with 
all the relevant governors and the proposal entered the 60-day public 
comment period.\4\ Conversely, lawmakers from Louisiana, which has a 
long history in offshore energy production, hailed the proposal as a 
boon for the state's economy.\5\

    Although the Secretary's comment was not a formal action, it re-
started a necessary discussion over federalism and the importance of 
state input. Pro-energy states, both onshore and offshore, have long 
disparaged Federal decisions to prohibit and delay energy development 
and job creation in their respective states. Previous Congresses and 
administrations have placed outright moratoriums on certain areas off 
America's coasts. Furthermore, costly bureaucratic delays on Federal 
lands for issuing leases and processing applications for permits to 
drill stalls production and economic growth. Without a doubt, 
frustration exists on both sides.
    The fundamental issue is that Federal ownership and control of 
minerals offshore (and onshore) has taken decision rights away from 
states. Both economically and environmentally, states have proven to 
manage energy development prudently. For example, where states have 
authority over applications for permits to drill and conduct 
environmental reviews, oil and gas production has soared.\6\ Energy 
companies have capitalized on the wealth of resources on private- and 
state-owned lands.\7\ The energy industry and consumers alike benefit 
from most of the shale oil and shale gas--from which much of the 
domestic production is coming--not being under Federal control.\8\

    However, Federal regulations and Federal land ownership have 
rendered vast quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas onshore and 
offshore either inaccessible or costlier to extract.\9\ Permitting 
energy extraction on federally owned land will result in even more oil 
and gas extraction and create jobs in areas that may not otherwise see 
such economic growth. On average, the Federal processing of an 
application for permit to drill (APD) in the last year of the Obama 
administration was 257 days, while state processing is typically 30 
days or less.\10\

    State control, local governance, and private-sector participation 
would result in more accountable, effective management. While the 
Federal Government can simply shift the costs of mismanagement to 
Federal taxpayers, states have powerful incentives for better 
management of resources on Federal lands. State governments can be more 
accountable to the people who will directly benefit from wise 
management decisions, especially as it pertains to natural resource 
management. According to a 2015 Property and Environment Research 
Council report, ``On average, states generate more revenue per dollar 
spent than the Federal Government on a variety of land management 
activities, including timber, grazing, minerals, and recreation.'' \11\

    Moreover, incentives to invest in and steward the environment are 
stronger when people have direct ownership and responsibility.\12\ The 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (FS) lands lost 
$4.38 per acre from 2009-2013, while trust lands in four western states 
earned $34.60 per acre.\13\ In terms simply of recreation, states again 
do a better job of making a return on their investment. Idaho and 
Montana averaged $6.86 per dollar spent on recreation on state trust 
lands; in contrast, the BLM earned $0.20 and the FS $0.28 per dollar 
spent, resulting in a net loss.\14\ While states and local communities 
may not always make perfect decisions, the best environmental policies 
are site- and situation-specific.

    Moreover, transferring decision rights to states and the private 
sector could lead to an industry that is more responsive to price 
changes. According to a working paper from Utah State University 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
economist Eric C. Edwards,
        Even though 99 percent of Federal drilling permits are 
        eventually approved, bureaucratic delay imposes costs through 
        delay and dampening. Drilling response is slower, and thus 
        wells on Federal lands do not respond to high oil and gas 
        prices as quickly as private lands. These delays also lead to 
        lower overall price responses--fewer overall wells drilled in 
        response to price increases. Our findings indicate that the 
        potential for improving the responsiveness of Federal lands to 
        price signals could be achieved through a reduction in delay in 
        the BLM permitting process.\15\

    While the study examines Federal lands, similar logic could apply 
to Federal waters. Remedying this situation could compensate states 
appropriately through expanded royalty revenue collection. With the 
exception of Alaska, states receive 50 percent of the revenues 
generated by onshore oil and natural gas production on Federal 
lands.\16\ Congress should apply this allocation offshore as well, 
including for current operations in the Gulf of Mexico. If Congress 
successfully transfers the permitting and environmental review to the 
states, the states should receive an even larger share of the royalty 
revenue collected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Drilling off states' coasts and allowing them a larger share of the 
royalty revenue would encourage more state involvement in drilling 
decisions. Offshore drilling would also promote state and local 
government participation in allocating funds, helping to close 
deficits, enabling coastal restoration and conservation, and using 
funds for schools.
    More financial stake and control over the regulatory process would 
encourage states to seriously consider the economic benefits and 
minimal risk associated with offshore energy production. In fact, as 
recently as 2013, both Democratic Senators from Virginia offered 
legislation to open parts of the Atlantic to offshore development.\17\ 
A critical component of their legislation was to ensure Virginia 
received royalty revenues similar to states in the Gulf Coast region. 
States may choose not to develop offshore oil, gas, wind, or ocean 
energy projects, and forego the economic benefits increased energy 
production brings.

        multiple year planning processes ignore market realities
    Oil and gas production is a time-consuming and capital-intensive 
operation. A company must win the lease sale or acquire the mineral 
rights, obtain the permits, conduct seismic surveys, build the 
necessary infrastructure, and drill and case the well. The entire 
process can take multiple years and the oil and gas industry makes 
investments considering multiple time horizons. However, the current 5-
year planning process is not the way commercial energy investments 
should be (let alone are, in reality) determined.
    By taking a static approach to dynamic energy markets, the Federal 
Government's current policy disregards how markets function. Energy 
markets are exceedingly complex and prices play a critical role by 
efficiently allocating resources to their highest valued use. 
Investment decisions change as prices change. Oil prices can fluctuate 
significantly from one month to the next, let alone over a 5-year 
window. For example (after adjusting for inflation):
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; From 2007-2008, the price of oil increased from $66 per 
            barrel to $94 per barrel.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; From 2008-2009, the price dropped to $56 dollars per 
            barrel, before increasing to $74 per barrel in 2009-2010.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; From 2011-2013, the price increased to above $94 per 
            barrel.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; From 2014-2015, the price decreased from $87 per barrel to 
            $44 per barrel.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; By 2016, significant increases in supply and less-than-
            projected demand pushed the price down to $38 per 
            barrel.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ See U.S. Energy Information Administration, ``U.S. Crude Oil 
First Purchase Price,'' January 2, 2018, https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/
hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;amp;s=F000000_3&amp;amp;f=A (accessed June 12, 2018).
    Businesses should be able more efficiently respond to such 
fluctuations in price rather than waiting on a lengthy planning process 
and specific lease-sale schedule. As energy companies plan for the 
near- and long-term, the Federal Government should conduct lease sales 
if a commercial interest exists and it does not jeopardize national 
security. It is incumbent upon the company to develop the resources 
safely and responsibly.
    Energy policy should not be predicated on what analysts, Members of 
Congress or Federal regulators think is going to happen. Instead, 
policy should open and establish the framework for competitive markets 
and involvement from the relevant states, while ensuring the protection 
of property rights and the environment.
  the problem of federal ownership and public interest determinations
    Oil and gas production is booming in some regions of the United 
States, while the rate of production in others has slowed or even 
decreased. The divergent trajectories in production primarily boil down 
to one word: ownership. Much of the growth is occurring on private and 
state-owned lands. Despite the tremendous abundance of oil and gas 
beneath Federal lands and off America's coasts, oil and gas output on 
federally owned lands has been mostly stagnant or declining. Companies 
operating in the United States have been the world's largest producers 
of oil and natural gas for 6 years; as a result, the Nation is reaping 
the tremendous economic benefits that such large-scale production 
generates. This success emerged organically from innovation in the 
private marketplace to unlock energy resources formerly thought 
inaccessible rather than from any specific government policy to promote 
these technologies and processes.
    The OCSLA's congressional declaration of policy states that the 
Outer Continental Shelf is a ``vital national resource reserve held by 
the Federal Government for the public, which should be made available 
for expeditious and orderly development, subject to environmental 
safeguards, in a manner which is consistent with the maintenance of 
competition and other national needs.'' \19\ The phrase ``held by the 
Federal Government for the public'' is at the crux of the problem. The 
Federal Government should not hold mineral rights for the public.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1332.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The establishment of national needs, national interest, or public 
interest determinations is broadly problematic for energy development 
and projects. Decisions that should be left to the private sector and 
by price signals are instead left to the Federal Government. For 
instance, national and public interest determinations have been 
manipulated into pretexts to obstruct energy development and energy 
infrastructure.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ For more information on this, see Nicolas Loris, ``Removing 
Restrictions on Liquid Natural Gas Exports: A Gift to the U.S. and 
Global Economies,'' Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 3232, July 27, 
2017, https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2017-07/BG3232.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unlike air or national security, minerals are not a public good. 
Public goods are non-rival and non-excludable. A non-rival good can be 
consumed at extremely low rates of marginal cost. Non-excludable goods 
are goods that people cannot be easily prevented from consuming. The 
energy that people use to light their schools, heat their homes, and 
move their vehicles is excludable and rival. For example, Katie cannot 
have access to gasoline unless she pays for it. Moreover, when Katie 
purchases a gallon of gas, that gallon cannot be simultaneously 
consumed by another consumer. Natural resources like oil and natural 
gas are privately produced and privately consumed.\21\ Just as the 
Federal Government does not make public or national interest 
determinations for the clothes its citizens purchase, neither should it 
do so for the energy they produce and consume.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \21\ Environmental statutes and regulations internalize the 
negative externalities associated with the burning of conventional 
fuels.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Another serious problem with public interest and national interest 
determinations is concentrating the decisions in the hands of 
government officials and regulators. No concrete definitions exist for 
national or public interest determinations, which introduces 
subjectivity into the determination. For example, the Natural Gas Act 
empowers the Federal Government to reject the import or export of 
natural gas to non-free trade agreement countries if that import or 
export is not ``consistent with the public interest.'' \22\ However, 
the law never specifies what criteria should be considered when 
addressing the public interest. The State Department contends with 
similar opaqueness for the national interest determination when 
deciding on cross-border pipelines. Moreover, the OCSLA gives no 
outline or detail for what the DOI should consider as ``national 
needs.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \22\ 15 U.S. Code Sec. 717b.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The vagueness of these considerations allows government officials 
to make decisions that properly belong to companies in the private 
sector. Rather than meeting certain criteria, these determinations 
empower regulators to arbitrarily make that determination for the rest 
of the Nation. Government officials will not always make determinations 
on whether to develop resources based on the public interest or even 
objective, transparent science; instead, they may base them on their 
own subjective values.
    The Obama administration's revised 2017-2022 leasing plan is also 
evidence of such subjectivity. Private actors incentivized by the 
profit motive will know much better than regulators in Washington as to 
where, when, and why drilling should take place. That does not preclude 
the need for an environmental review and permitting process, or 
consideration of national security impacts, but the permitting process 
should not be embedded in a 5-year planning process that outlines where 
companies may produce energy in accord with a subjective, extremely 
vague public interest determination.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ Nor does it mean that state regulatory regimes will always 
make sound policy decisions. New York's ban on hydraulic fracturing and 
Florida's request for an exemption are examples of that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    opening auctions to all parties
    Two of the objectives of the Enhancing State Management of Federal 
Lands and Waters Act are to empower states and provide a fair return 
for taxpayers for producing or not producing public resources that, in 
their current state, belong to all Americans. As detailed in the 
previous section, a number of problems arise from public ownership of 
resources, many of which privatization would solve. Another problem is 
entrusting government officials to make decisions for the American 
people in the name of public interest. As free-market environmentalist 
Jane S. Shaw writes in discussing public choice theory, ``although 
people acting in the political marketplace have some concern for 
others, their main motive, whether they are voters, politicians, 
lobbyists, or bureaucrats, is self-interest.'' \24\ In other words, 
government officials are people, too.

Encyclopedia of Economics (Library of Economics and Liberty, 1993),

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Absent privatization, one way Congress could more accurately value 
the land and resources is to open the lease auctions to all interested 
parties. Currently, only energy companies can bid on lease auctions and 
the Federal Government requires leaseholders to demonstrate intent to 
develop the resources. Restricting who bids and requiring the winner 
develop the parcels eliminates competition and fails to assess the 
relative value of the land. Conservationists, recreationists, 
alternative energy companies, ranchers, or environmentalists may value 
the land more for their intended use than for oil and gas development. 
As economist Michael Giberson and research fellow Shawn Regan write in 
their public comment on Federal oil and gas royalties, ``No method 
reliably integrates the variety of diverse, predominantly subjective, 
and sometimes conflicting values into a single, uncontroversial auction 
reserve price.'' \25\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Opening the leasing process to all interested parties would not 
only create more competition but also potentially more cooperation. An 
environmental organization could pair up with a grazer to bid on a 
block of land. An energy company could coordinate conservationist 
groups to use the land in which both parties can benefit. Natural 
resource extraction would likely still occur, but oil and gas 
production will occur because the energy companies value the land and 
resources more than other contending interests do. As values change 
(for instance, if oil prices rise), buyout programs and lease re-
offerings would ensure that competing interests remain involved in 
current and future land-use decisions. One challenge will be to 
establish a mechanism to compensate taxpayers for lost royalty 
revenues, which the BLM could accomplish by assessing grazing, 
recreation, or other land-use fees.
    Giberson and Regan write, ``In a number of cases private 
conservation groups have negotiated with parties over specific grazing 
rights or oil and gas leases on Federal lands in an effort to protect 
environmental values. As long ago as 1992 the Conservation Fund 
purchased grazing rights in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in 
southern Utah. By 2003, at least a half-dozen conservation and 
sportsmen organizations had grazing permit buyout programs. In 2012 the 
Trust for Public Land, a conservation group, worked with a variety of 
other groups and donors to purchase and retire oil and gas leases 
representing 58,000 acres in Wyoming's Hoback Basin from Plains 
Exploration and Production Co.'' \26\

          energy, economic diversity, and environmental safety
    For 6 years, the United States has been the world's leading 
producer in petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbons, which has produced 
astounding economic benefits and put money back into the wallets of 
American families. In fact, in November 2017 the U.S. crude oil 
supplies surpassed 10 million barrels per day, breaking a record high 
from nearly 50 years ago. The extraordinary technological advancements 
in resource extraction have the United States in position to overtake 
Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's top oil producer. The latest 
projection from the Energy Information Administration estimates that 
U.S. production could reach nearly 12 million barrels per day in 
2019.\27\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The story is made more amazing by the fact that Federal energy 
policy actively hindered this energy renaissance as it was taking 
place. Centuries' worth of oil, natural gas, and coal resources lie 
beneath private property as well as under lands owned by state 
governments. While federally owned lands are also full of energy 
potential, a bureaucratic regulatory regime has mismanaged land use for 
decades. The tremendous economic benefits of open energy markets and 
the proven track record of the individual states' regulatory structures 
dictate a re-examination of the way the Federal Government manages 
resources on Federal lands.
    Both onshore and offshore energy production has the potential to 
boost and diversify states' economies. Whether it is hunting, fishing, 
recreation, or seafood production, energy production and other 
industries can work in harmony. Texas, California, North Dakota, 
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Alaska, and others have demonstrated 
this for periods spanning more than a century and a half.
    When it comes to offshore production, Louisiana is the poster child 
for a state that benefits from an abundance of offshore natural 
resources but also has strong industries in seafood and tourism. With 
more than 80 percent of waterborne U.S. rigs off Louisiana's coast,\28\ 
and with oil and gas production in the Gulf Coast region accounting for 
approximately 18 percent of oil production and 4 percent of natural gas 
production in the United States,\29\ the state has generated 
significant economic benefits. The energy industry contributes tens of 
billions of dollars annually to the economic welfare of the state and 
is a critical part of the state's culture and way of life. In 2014, the 
industry generated $44 billion for the state economy and another $36 
billion when including related infrastructure and refining 
activity.\30\

    In addition to energy production, seafood and tourism industries 
stand out as significant contributors to Louisiana's economy. Louisiana 
represents 30 percent of the commercial fishing for the continental 
United States and are substantial producers of shrimp, oysters, 
crawfish, and crabs.\31\ Many of the seafood businesses are smaller, 
family-owned operations that have a long and rich history. Annually, 
the industry creates $2.4 billion in economic growth for Louisiana.\32\ 
In 2016, 46.7 million people visited Louisiana, generating $16.8 
billion.\33\

    These industries work in harmony. Every year, residents of the Gulf 
region come to Morgan City, Louisiana, to celebrate the lifeblood of 
the region's economy: seafood and oil. The Louisiana Shrimp and 
Petroleum Festival's website emphasizes ``the unique way in which these 
two seemingly different industries work hand-in-hand culturally and 
environmentally in our area.'' \34\ The festival is a tradition that 
dates back more than 80 years. Even the adverse effects of the 
Deepwater Horizon oil rig accident did not disrupt the harmony of the 
state economy. In many respects, the spill strengthened the bond 
between the oil and seafood industry, with shrimpers and fishers alike 
extremely vocal in support of lifting the offshore drilling ban after 
the spill.\35\ At the time, Harlon Pearce, owner of one of the largest 
seafood processors in the state and Chair of Louisiana's Seafood 
Promotion and Marketing Board, said, ``I am not in favor of the 
moratorium. You've got to be down here to see and feel what I'm telling 
you. It's our brothers, uncles, and cousins that are working in the oil 
industry.'' \36\ Ewell Smith, executive director of the Board, said, 
``If you've seen Grand Isle or those [other fishing communities], 
you've seen how much oil and gas and seafood co-exist in this state.''

the economy. With the abundance of energy off America's coastline, 
other states have the opportunity to imitate the symbiotic relationship 
between the energy industry and other critical sectors of the economy 
in Louisiana.
                         a better path forward
    The statutes guiding oil and gas development on Federal lands and 
Federal waters are in need of comprehensive reform. The Enhancing State 
Management of Federal Lands and Waters Act would accomplish two 
important objectives in delegating more authority to the states and 
using financial incentives to inform states' decisions. States share 
the cost of the maintenance of Federal lands, whether by the liability 
of no management, the lost opportunity of poor management, or the 
infrastructure needed to support development of resources. States have 
a proven record of managing resources, and already have the regulatory 
structures in place to do so on Federal lands within their boundaries 
as well. Not only would new management multiply benefits for all 
Americans, it would also encourage better care of the environment and 
natural resources by putting them in the hands of people who have an 
immediate stake in wise management. Washington-centric approach to 
management stifles creative, collaborative solutions to competing 
interests that could be resolved at local, state, or regional levels 
without the added baggage of national political battles and Federal 
regulatory processes. While states and local communities may not always 
make perfect decisions, the best environmental policies are site-
specific and situation-specific and emanate from liberty.
    Several ways in which policy makers could improve the draft 
legislation are to:
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Specify that if the Secretary of Interior does not make a 
            decision to approve or disapprove of an application for an 
            enhanced management region program, that the plan is 
            approved. Forcing the DOI to issue a decision will prevent 
            the agency from sitting on the application.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Confirm that the Department of the Interior is the lead 
            agency for any section of land where management includes 
            both the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. 
            Problems have arisen with competing land-use plans between 
            the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management in the 
            past. Designating a lead agency will help avoid any 
            duplication or confusion.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Apply the same reforms to all energy sources and 
            technologies. States should have the same incentives and 
            choices the draft legislation provides to oil and gas 
            production, whether it is a solar farm in Nevada or an 
            offshore wind farm in the Atlantic.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Eliminate the 5-year planning process for offshore 
            leasing. The current 5-year planning process ignores how 
            businesses operate in the face of rapid market and 
            technological changes. Through legislation, Congress should 
            eliminate the 5-year plans and authorize the DOI to conduct 
            lease sales if interest for development exists while 
            weighting the consultation with heavily impacted states in 
            offering those lease sales. Such a reform would allow the 
            safe development of energy off America's coasts while 
            empowering state stakeholders. Removing the lengthy and 
            unnecessary planning process would create a system that is 
            more responsive both to price changes and to the needs and 
            interests of states. The permitting would also need to meet 
            any Department of Defense requirements.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Empower companies, groups, and people that are not energy 
            companies to bid on lease sales. If a conservationist 
            organization values non-production or an alternative use of 
            land or waters, they should be permitted to bid in the 
            auction. Opening up the bidding process would incentivize 
            more competition and potentially more cooperation and could 
            alleviate some of the non-production fees a state would 
            have to pay for failing to develop oil and gas reserves.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Ensure that states have access to resources within their 
            boundaries or off their coasts in the event that the 
            current Administration is hostile to energy production. 
            States have expressed concern over the Department of the 
            Interior's aggressive push to open access to the abundance 
            of resources in the OCS. A number of political and economic 
            factors could force that to change. Just as the Federal 
            Government should not force energy production upon the 
            states, the Department of the Interior (and Department of 
            Agriculture) should not obstruct a state's desire to 
            produce energy and create jobs within their borders and 
            administrative boundaries. Congress and the Federal 
            Government should, at the very least, ensure access to 
            provide the choice to the states to develop natural 
            resources and alternative forms of energy.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Transfer the environmental review and permitting process 
            for offshore energy development to the states. Similar to 
            the draft legislation's proposal that would allow states to 
            assume exclusive jurisdiction over the leasing, permitting, 
            and development of oil and gas operations for enhanced 
            management regions, Congress should amend the OCSLA and SLA 
            to do the same for offshore operations if a state desires 
            to assume responsibility. The state regulatory program 
            would be sufficient in lieu of Federal requirements (e.g., 
            from the Clean Air Act and the National Environmental 
            Policy Act). To support their reviews, state regulators can 
            request technical or safety expertise from the Bureau of 
            Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and 
            Environmental Enforcement and use previous DOI 
            environmental assessments. In addition, state regulators 
            would work in conjunction with the Environmental Protection 
            Agency and the U.S. Coast Guard to assess environmental 
            impact and maritime safety and security. States assuming 
            responsibility would also receive a higher percentage of 
            the royalties.
                               conclusion
    For decades, excessive regulations and bureaucratic inefficiencies 
have stymied oil and gas production and prevented the full effects of 
the energy boom. It can take anywhere from 5 to 10 years for a company 
to move from approval to production, with no guarantee that the permit 
obtained will lead to successful crude oil production.\42\ Much of this 
is due to regulatory red tape and Federal control over resource 
production. Authorizing states to manage onshore and offshore resource 
production for a greater percentage of the revenue will create a system 
that permits industry to better respond to changing market conditions. 
The Enhancing State Management of Federal Lands and Waters Act would 
implement significant reforms that involve states more directly with 
the decision-making process, protect the American taxpayers, and align 
incentives for energy production and environmental protection.

    &lt;option&gt; GOVERNMENT IN THE WEST, SUTHERLAND INSTITUTE, SALT LAKE CITY, 
                              UTAH
    Mr. Anderson. Good morning, Chairman Bishop, Chairman 
Gosar, Ranking Member Lowenthal, and members of the 
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;invitation to speak this morning.
    The West is home to some spectacular landscapes. Towering 
red rock mesas, endless seas of sage brush, and majestic 
mountains make the West's public lands as diverse as they are 
beautiful. This diversity and splendor is not lost on those who 
call the West home. In fact, no one knows or loves these public 
lands more than locals whose history, culture, and future 
depend on the health, accessibility, and the life-sustaining 
resources of these lands. Simply put, public lands are our 
whole world.
    Despite this reality, a narrative persists that state 
management of Federal lands will set aside environmental 
stewardship and recreational activities in favor of 
unrestrained logging, grazing, and extraction practices.
    My testimony aims to debunk this by focusing on the 
extraordinary efforts being taken by western states to balance 
conservation and recreation alongside economic interest.
    When it comes to recreation, western states recognize the 
increased demand, both in the terms of number of people and 
types of recreational activities. Today, there are more hikers, 
mountain bikers, snowmobilers, and off-road enthusiasts than 
ever before in the West.
    We see that western states are stepping up to the plate and 
meeting recreational demands through innovative and popular 
solutions on state lands.
    Despite the perception that state trust lands are managed 
solely for resource extraction, western state trust land 
agencies are accommodating recreational demands while still 
meeting the fiduciary responsibilities. In fact, most western 
state trust lands allow recreational use, either free or 
through the purchase of moderately priced permits.
    Some western states have also elected to lease parcels for 
specific recreational opportunities, like mountain biking, to 
provide a better recreational experience than can be found on 
Federal lands.
    Some state trust agencies are even purchasing land to 
enhance recreation. For example, Montana's land banking program 
allows the sale of state trust lands that have low recreational 
value, and the revenues are used to purchase lands with more 
recreational opportunities.
    The purchased parcels are required to generate more 
revenues than those sold so land banking meets financial and 
recreational demands. Since 2003, 68,000 acres of Montana trust 
lands have been sold, 84 percent of which were surrounded by 
private lands and largely inaccessible.
    In return, nearly 65,000 acres of legally-accessible land 
with recreational opportunities have been purchased.
    Western state parks also provide exceptional recreational 
opportunities and are incredibly popular. In fact, although the 
West state parks make up only one-fifth as much land as 
national parks in the West, they bring in nearly 80 percent as 
many visitors on a per acre basis. This is largely due to the 
types and quality of recreational opportunities they provide 
that are enhanced by developed amenities, like lodges, visitor 
centers, campgrounds, and other guest services. But these parks 
don't solely focus on recreation. They are also known for 
wildlife habitat and environmental preservation.
    Western states are doing much more than designating and 
retaining state parks to preserve the environment, and my home 
state of Utah is no exception.
    Utah has the largest active watershed and wildlife habitat 
restoration program in the United States. The Utah Legislature 
has partnered with local hunters and the Federal Government to 
invest about $14 million annually for conservation and was 
restored almost 1.5 million acres since 2005.
    In 2014, the Utah State Legislature passed the Utah 
Wilderness Act, recognizing the importance of protecting the 
wilderness areas and providing a path for preserving state 
lands as state wilderness areas. And most recently, many of 
Utah State officials have thrown their support behind House 
Bill 4532, which prohibits mineral extraction within 1.35 
million acres of the Bears Ears region.
    These types of efforts are being led and conducted across 
the West. You see, Westerners understand and embrace the 
reality that local decision making and sensible land management 
are not mutually exclusive and appreciate this recognition by 
the Enhancing State Management of Federal Lands and Waters Act.
    However, we at Sutherland maintain that more can and should 
be done if this legislation's intent is to make localism the 
guiding principle of Federal land management. If states are 
wise and experienced enough to make decisions regarding oil and 
gas drilling on public lands, then don't they have the capacity 
to manage recreational opportunities, logging, grazing, 
wildlife, and environmental protection as well?
    As is evidenced by the cited example, there is no hard and 
fast rule as to what gets priority on public lands under state 
management. Instead, local voices, expertise, values, and 
circumstances guide the sustainable uses over state land 
management and should do the same for Federal multiple-use 
public lands. Under this approach, states become the agent of 
the Federal Government in setting multiple-use priorities on 
publicly-controlled Federal lands to the benefit of the public, 
state and Federal budgets, and the lands themselves.
    Localism would drive better public land management by 
leveraging local knowledge and manpower while maintaining the 
opportunity for Federal guideposts to protect against bad 
actors. In short, if localism is a good approach for oil and 
gas drilling, then why not further uses on our public lands. 
Thank you.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt; Prepared Statement of Matthew Anderson, Director of the Coalition for 
     Self-Government in the West, a project of Sutherland Institute
    Good morning, Chairman Bishop, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member 
Lowenthal, and members of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral 
Resources. Thank you for the invitation to speak.

                                 ______
    Mr. Gosar. Thank you, Mr. Anderson.
    I now recognize Mr. Cahoon for his 5-minute testimony.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;                      HEAD, NORTH CAROLINA
    Mr. Cahoon. Good morning, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member 
Lowenthal, and honorable Committee members. My name is Ben 
Cahoon, and I am the mayor of Nags Head, North Carolina, and I 
am a Republican.
    I greatly appreciate the opportunity to testify before you 
today. My testimony will cover the impacts of seismic air gun 
blasting and offshore drilling, the legal and transparency 
problems associated with seismic air gun blasting, the 
absurdity of creating new financial penalties for coastal 
states that oppose drilling, the devastating economic 
consequences that offshore drilling and seismic testing could 
bring to our coast, the threat to existing national security 
operations, and the large and widespread bipartisan opposition 
to offshore drilling and seismic air gun blasting.
    Proponents of seismic air gun blasting often 
mischaracterize an old quote from Dr. Bill Brown of BOEM, 
claiming that seismic air gun blasting has no impact on marine 
mammal populations. However, there is a substantial body of 
peer-reviewed science showing that seismic air gun blasting 
negatively affects marine mammals, potentially even at the 
population level. For example, whales exposed to seismic air 
gun noise stop producing vocalizations that are essential to 
their feeding, avoiding predators, breeding, and raising their 
young.
    Scientific studies show behavioral and physiological 
impacts to marine life. These include killing zooplankton 
causing mass mortality and immune system damage to scallops, 
causing oysters to stop feeding and breeding, depressing long-
line cod and haddock catch by 70 to 80 percent, and a 78 
percent decline in reef fish abundance after seismic air gun 
blasting was conducted in the area.
    Proponents for testing and drilling often argue that 
seismic tests are necessary to provide coastal communities with 
data about oil and gas deposits off their shores to assess 
whether it makes economic sense to move forward with drilling 
for those resources. But that information is considered 
propriety by the private companies conducting them. Local 
decision makers won't have access to it nor will the public. 
Not even Members of Congress can get their hands on it.
    Currently, there are at least five companies awaiting final 
permits from BOEM to conduct seismic testing along the Atlantic 
Coast. Most of these companies are foreign and will not be 
investing in our communities. Therefore, BOEM is literally 
putting foreign business interests ahead of our hard-working 
American workers who are dependent on healthy ocean ecosystems 
for survival.
    This bill would create financial penalties for coastal 
states where there has been no offshore drilling in decades. I 
will cover the overwhelming opposition in more detail later, 
but nearly every East and West Coast governor has spoken out 
against this Administration's proposal to open nearly all 
waters to new offshore drilling for the first time in over 30 
years. Creating financial penalties for these states, where 
coastal businesses depend on clean and healthy oceans, would 
just establish a revenue scheme to transfer money from the 
states to the Federal Government. Coastal states should not be 
penalized for protecting their existing economic interests.
    Based on a rough estimate, using the methodology outlined 
in the draft legislation, states could be forced to pay 
hundreds of millions of dollars just to protect their thriving 
coastal economies. It is inappropriate, and once again, 
Washington is pushing its beliefs onto local citizens instead 
of listening to their vehement opposition.
    Oil and gas development poses a real threat to the fishing, 
tourism, and recreation-based businesses along the East and 
West Coasts that each year generate around $180 billion in 
gross domestic product and support nearly 2.6 million jobs.
    The President's newly proposed national OCS program also 
proposes to offer leases in areas that have extensive military 
operations, thus risking our national security training and 
readiness.
    The draft plan deviates from the long-standing tradition of 
deference to the Department of Defense when offering leases in 
Federal waters. Secretary Zinke famously met with Florida 
Governor Rick Scott on the tarmac of the Tallahassee airport, 
where the Secretary announced that, due to the Governor's 
opposition to Florida being included in the 5-year plan and 
Florida's unique coastal environment and tourism, the state 
would be removed from the 5-year plan. That is great that the 
Governor and Secretary are listening to state and local 
leaders, but nearly every other state along the Atlantic Coast 
has requested the same meeting and treatment Governor Scott 
received.
    Offshore drilling in any new areas is not the answer. 
Unfortunately, this legislation would place an absurd penalty 
on coastal states requiring states to pay the Federal 
Government to protect their coast, potentially costing 
taxpayers millions of dollars. Creating a ransom for coastal 
states to protect their coastal economy's way of life and 
military readiness violates core conservative principles.
    I urge this Committee to reject this draft and any calls to 
penalize coastal states for protecting their coastal economies.
    I thank you for the opportunity to testify here today, and 
I look forward to answering your questions.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;  Prepared Statement of the Honorable Benjamin Cahoon, Mayor of Nags 
                          Head, North Carolina
    Good morning, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Lowenthal, and 
honorable Committee members. My name is Ben Cahoon, and I am the Mayor 
of Nags Head, North Carolina, and I am a Republican. I greatly 
appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today about the 
importance of protecting our coasts from expanded offshore drilling and 
seismic airgun blasting. My testimony today will cover: (1) the impacts 
of seismic airgun blasting and offshore drilling; (2) the legal and 
transparency problems associated with seismic airgun blasting; (3) the 
absurdity of creating new financial penalties for coastal states that 
oppose drilling; (4) the devastating economic consequences that 
offshore drilling and seismic testing could bring to our coast; (5) the 
threat to existing national security operations; and (6) the large/
widespread, bipartisan opposition to offshore drilling and seismic 
airgun blasting.
        impacts of seismic airgun blasting and offshore drilling
    Dangerous exploration for offshore oil involves seismic airguns 
shooting loud blasts of compressed air through the ocean and into the 
seafloor.\1\ These loud blasts are repeated every 10-12 seconds \2\ for 
days, weeks or months at a time.\3\ These seismic airguns are one of 
the loudest sources of noise in the oceans.\4\ According to the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the sound from 
seismic airguns can be recorded from sites more than 1,860 miles away, 
equivalent to the distance from Washington, DC all the way to Las 
Vegas.

    Scientists agree that seismic airgun blasts could alter marine 
mammals' behavior, affecting their migration patterns, mating habits 
and how they communicate with each other. Most animals in the ocean use 
sound the way animals on land use eyesight; saturating their 
environment with noise will have an impact. NOAA estimates that marine 
animals like dolphins and whales could be harmed hundreds of thousands 
of times.
    Proponents of seismic airgun blasting often mischaracterize an old 
quote from Dr. Bill Brown of BOEM, claiming that seismic airgun 
blasting has no impact on marine mammal populations--``populations'' 
being the key qualifier. However, there is a substantial body of peer-
reviewed science showing that seismic airgun blasting negatively 
affects marine mammals, potentially even at the population level. For 
example, whales exposed to seismic airgun noise stop producing 
vocalizations that are essential to feeding, avoiding predators, 
breeding, and raising their young. In the baleen whales, these impacts 
can occur across vast distances, as much as 100,000 square kilometers 
or more around a single seismic array. Recent science shows that there 
are population level impacts.\5\

impacts to marine life. These include a 2017 study documenting seismic

away; \6\ a 2017 study documenting seismic airgun blasting causing mass 
mortality in scallops and severely impacting the remaining scallops'

    When the industry proceeds from seismic surveys to exploratory 
drilling or production, the risks of harm become even greater for 
coastal communities that rely upon a clean coast. Once drilling begins, 
we know that accidents happen in a world where human error, mechanical 
imperfections and coastal hurricanes all play unexpected roles. When 
you drill, you spill. It is inevitable.
    We saw what happened in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 when the 
exploratory BP Deepwater Horizon rig spilled millions of barrels of oil 
into the Gulf. It was a disaster, but at least the Gulf's bowl-like 
shape contained the spill in that region. A similar spill off the 
Atlantic Coast would be a disaster of epic proportions. If oil entered 
the Gulf Stream, it could be carried into the Chesapeake Bay, the 
Hudson River Valley, the Gulf of Maine, and the Grand Banks, which are 
some of the richest fishing grounds in the world.
    The Gulf of Mexico BP Deepwater Horizon blowout showed that oil 
cannot be removed from salt marshes and other wetland systems. It can 
remain in the sediments for decades. Coastal salt marshes in North 
Carolina are among the most productive ecosystems in the world and are 
nursery grounds for many estuarine and marine species. Toxic substances 
from oil spills, both chronic and acute, will put all of these 
organisms at risk.
    Even if a major spill never occurs--and both the oil industry and 
the Federal Government admit that spills are inevitable--there's still 
an adverse impact to North Carolina's coast in that the land-based 
infrastructure necessary to support offshore drilling is dirty and 
highly industrial. Also, the infrastructure required to transport 
offshore oil is devastating. For example, a series of canals built 
across Louisiana wetlands to transport oil has led to vast destruction 
of marshlands. Healthy marshlands are a critical component of our 
ecosystem.
    Sometimes we hear elected officials claim that they want to explore 
and drill for natural gas only, while leaving the oil in the ground. 
One doesn't explore for just gas. According to current law, oil and gas 
companies are required to operate their wells to ``maximize ultimate 
recovery.'' \12\ When oil and gas occur together in a reservoir, as the 
oil is produced, the gas cap expands helping to remove the oil, 
essentially pushing it out of the pore spaces in the rocks. When 
exploration wells are drilled, one finds oil and/or gas and/or water 
and/or nothing. Then the oil company determines if it's economical to 
produce the reserves they found, and if so, submits a plan to BOEM 
about how they will produce the well.

       legal and transparency issues with seismic airgun blasting
    Proponents for testing and drilling often argue that seismic tests 
are necessary to provide coastal communities with data about oil and 
gas deposits off their shores to assess whether it makes economic sense 
to move forward with drilling for those resources. But that information 
is considered proprietary by the private companies conducting them. 
Local decision makers won't have access to it, nor will the public. Not 
even Members of Congress can get their hands on it.
    Currently, there are at least five companies awaiting final permits 
from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to conduct seismic 
testing along the Atlantic Coast. Most of these companies are foreign 
and will not be investing in our communities. In fact, Reuters reported 
that a French-based company, CGG, is dependent on the Atlantic contract 
to avoid bankruptcy.\13\ Therefore, BOEM is literally putting foreign 
business interests ahead of hard-working American workers who are 
dependent on healthy ocean ecosystems for survival.

          absurdity of financial penalties for coastal states
    This bill would create financial penalties for coastal states where 
there has been no offshore drilling in decades. I'll cover the 
overwhelming opposition in more detail later, but nearly every East and 
West Coast governor has spoken out against the Trump administration's 
proposal to open nearly all waters to new offshore drilling for the 
first time in over 30 years. Creating financial penalties for these 
states, where coastal businesses depend on clean and healthy oceans, 
would just establish a revenue scheme to transfer money from states to 
the Federal Government. This approach is outrageous, and I urge this 
Committee to reject this attempt to hold states like mine hostage. 
Coastal states should not be penalized for protecting their existing 
economic interests.
    Based on a rough estimate, using the methodology outlined in the 
draft legislation, states could be forced to pay hundreds of millions 
of dollars just to protect their thriving coastal economies, including 
massive penalties to the Federal Government for not opening their 
coastline to dirty and dangerous offshore drilling.
    It's inappropriate, and once again, Washington is pushing its 
beliefs onto local citizens, instead of listening to their vehement 
opposition.
  economic impact and risks of expanded offshore drilling and seismic 
                            airgun blasting
    Oil and gas development poses a real threat to the fishing, 
tourism, and recreation-based businesses along the East and West Coasts 
that each year generate around $180 billion in gross domestic product 
and support nearly 2.6 million jobs. The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill 
caused 10 million lost days of beach, fishing, and boating activity. 
Many leisure travelers stayed away from Florida's Gulf Coast in the 
months following the spill, even in areas that did not have oil on 
their beaches.
    The Federal Energy Information Administration now predicts the 
Nation will be a net energy exporter within a decade--for the first 
time since the 1970s. There's no need for offshore oil production off 
North Carolina's coast, especially in light of the costs noted above.
    The American Petroleum Institute says oil and gas drilling could 
result in $3.3 billion to North Carolina over a two-decade period. That 
sounds like a fairly big number, but according to ``Visit North 
Carolina,'' which is a part of the Economic Development Partnership of 
North Carolina, tourists in North Carolina spent nearly 10 times that 
amount--more than $20 billion--in 2016 alone.\14\ Even the most 
lucrative oil and gas scenario would generate roughly 1 percent of the 
economic impact tourism has on the state. Further, these industries do 
not live harmoniously. Along the Gulf Coast, beach goers are provided 
with wipes to clean the oil and tar balls from their feet after walking 
on the beach. To the residents of North Carolina, that scenario is 
unacceptable, as our beaches are major revenue generators and part of 
our way of life. Moreover, tourism revenue increases every year with no 
signs of that trend slowing; the same cannot be said of the demand for 
oil.

2016-Economic-Impact-of-Travel-on-North-Carolina-Counties-revised.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The economically recoverable amount of oil and gas that could be 
produced off North Carolina's coast, according to Department of the 
Interior estimates, would meet U.S. demand for roughly 65 of oil and 57 
days of gas, and there's no guarantee that the drilling will pan out at 
all. There's so little oil, and the risk is far too great. It's not 
worth the risk for North Carolina when we look at how much GDP and how 
many jobs are generated by healthy ocean ecosystems including fishing, 
recreation and tourism. In 2016 alone, these industries generated over 
$2.5 billion in GDP and nearly 57,000 jobs.\15\ Risking our ocean and 
way of life is not worth the economic trade-off.

            threat to existing national security operations
    The President's newly proposed National OCS Program also proposes 
to offer leases in areas that have extensive military operations, thus 
risking our national security training and readiness. The draft plan 
deviates from the long-standing tradition of deference to the 
Department of Defense (DoD) when offering offshore drilling leases in 
Federal waters. The Atlantic and Eastern Gulf of Mexico are home to 
critical coastal military facilities, including Norfolk Naval Station--
the largest naval station in the world. In the Atlantic Ocean, DoD 
conducts extensive readiness operations including live fire tests, air-
to-surface bombing exercises, homing torpedo testing, supersonic test 
flights, laser targeting operations, and both Naval Air and Sea Systems 
Command. DoD's 2015 report on mission compatibility with offshore 
leasing indicated that significant restrictions on oil and gas activity 
in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic planning regions would be 
necessary to ensure that DoD activities would not be impaired.
    Furthermore, DoD has made it clear that the continuation of the 
moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico is 
essential to vital military readiness activities. An April 2017 letter 
from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense states, ``The 
Department of Defense (DoD) cannot overstate the vital importance of 
maintaining this moratorium.'' The letter continues, ``The moratorium 
on oil and gas `leasing, pre-leasing, and other related activities' 
ensures that these vital military readiness activities may be conducted 
without interference and is critical to their continuation. Emerging 
technologies . . . will require enlarged testing and training 
footprints, and increased DoD reliance of the Gulf of Mexico Energy 
Security Act's moratorium beyond 2022.'' A separate June 2017 letter 
from the Air Force states, ``The moratorium is essential for developing 
and sustaining the Air Force's future combat capabilities.''
    The Department of Defense hosts a wide variety of training and 
testing activities critical to military readiness and our national 
security. The Department's own public statements make it clear that new 
leasing could create conflict with long-standing operations throughout 
the Atlantic. It makes no sense to put my home state of North Carolina 
or any new areas at risk when the proposal presents a direct threat to 
our national security.
 bipartisan opposition to offshore drilling and seismic airgun blasting
    By bringing offshore drilling to shores where Americans have 
already spoken vehemently against it, this proposed legislation 
undermines Congress' commitment to local and state decision making.
    Recently, Secretary Zinke met with Florida Governor Rick Scott on 
the tarmac of the Tallahassee Airport, where in front of several TV 
cameras, the Secretary announced that due to the Governor's opposition 
to Florida being included in the 5-year plan, and Florida's unique 
coastal environment and tourism, the state would be removed from the 5-
year plan. While that is great that the Governor and Secretary are 
listening to state and local leaders, nearly every other state along 
the Atlantic Coast has requested the same meeting and treatment Gov. 
Scott received. In fact, on the East Coast, governors from Florida, 
South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New 
Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and 
Massachusetts all oppose the draft 5-year plan for 2019-2024. It should 
be noted that the governor of Georgia has recently shifted his position 
from supporting more offshore drilling off their coast to expressing 
concerns with this new national OCS program. Additionally, it will not 
be clear whether Florida is removed, formally, until the Proposed 
Program is released.
    As of today, opposition and concern over offshore drilling 
activities includes:
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Bipartisan opposition and concern from governors of 
            Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, 
            Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, 
            Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Washington, 
            Oregon and California
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; More than 275 East Coast and Pacific Coast municipalities
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Bipartisan opposition from more than 1,700 local, state 
            and Federal elected officials
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; An alliance representing over 43,000 East Coast businesses 
            and 500,000 fishing families
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; An alliance representing over 1,000 West Coast businesses
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The New England, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic and Pacific 
            fishery management councils
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Commercial and recreational fishing interests such as the 
            Southeastern Fisheries Association, Fisheries Survival 
            Fund, Southern Shrimp Alliance, The Billfish Foundation and 
            the International Game Fish Association
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; NASA, the Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force and the 
            Florida Defense Support Task Force
    Offshore drilling in any new areas is not the answer. 
Unfortunately, this legislation would place an absurd penalty on 
coastal states, requiring states to pay the Federal Government to 
protect their coast, potentially costing taxpayers millions of dollars. 
Creating a ransom for coastal states to protect their coastal 
economies, way of life, and military readiness violates core 
conservative principles. I urge this Committee to reject this draft and 
any calls to penalize coastal states for protecting their coastal 
economies.
    I thank you for the opportunity to testify here today, and I look 
forward to answering your questions.
                                 ______
    Mr. Gosar. Thank you, Mr. Cahoon.
    I now recognize Mr. Ebell for his 5 minutes.
    Welcome.
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt; ENVIRONMENT, COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC
    Mr. Ebell. Thank you, Chairman Gosar, and thank you for 
inviting me to testify today.
    I apologize for being late. I am very interested by your 
draft discussion bill. I think a lot of thought has gone into 
it, and a lot of thought is going to go into it in the future 
as you work out the details.
    I would like to say that as part of the President's agenda 
to get the economy moving again, this is a very important part. 
The energy renaissance in the United States, because of the 
shale oil and gas revolution, is going to go forward whether 
this bill happens or not. America is going to become, and I 
think already is today, the world's leading energy producer. 
Over 80 percent of the world's energy comes from coal, oil, and 
natural gas. That was true 30 years ago. It was true 20 years 
ago. It is true today.
    It is projected to be true 10, 20 and 30 years from now. 
But the pie keeps getting bigger; that is, the world's energy 
demands keep growing. Most of that energy is going to come from 
coal, oil, and natural gas.
    So, whether or not the Federal lands and offshore areas 
take their place as major energy producers, the United States 
is going to be leading the way. But as someone who comes from a 
Federal lands state and has watched the mismanagement of our 
Federal lands lead to economic decline for decades, our mineral 
resources in some parts of the West are a very important part 
of getting rural economies going again.
    Not only does energy production on Federal land create 
wealth for the whole economy, it creates wealth for local 
people. Having seen the stagnation of oil and gas production on 
Federal land is very worrying, and I think your proposal to 
turn it over to the states, the management of oil and gas 
leasing, is a very good way to get around the mismanagement 
that the BLM doesn't seem to be able to fix.
    As far as the coastal provisions, in my testimony, I have 
emphasized the need for the first section, which is to do a 
comprehensive geologic survey, the mapping section of your 
bill. It is very important in making public policy to base it 
on information and not on the lack of information. And as you 
know, on all of the Federal lands issues, there is a lack of 
systematic information. In fact, the BLM land annual that shows 
land ownership is highly defective. We need a survey of all the 
Federal lands and what lands have been withdrawn in various 
categories, including mineral withdrawals.
    I would like to conclude by going to the second section of 
the offshore proposal, the idea that if a state wants a 
moratorium on offshore development, they can actually get it; 
they don't have to try to apply political pressure so that one 
state gets a special deal and another state does not. They can 
actually say: we want a moratorium, and here is what we are 
willing to pay for it.
    So, I think this is a real solution to a very thorny issue 
of federalism. And I applaud the Committee's creative thinking 
on this. I wish I had thought of it. I am glad you did. And I 
think, in addition to revenue sharing, adding royalty sharing 
to the offshore states, which provides a powerful incentive to 
want to have offshore oil production, that, in addition to that 
incentive, having the ability of the state to actually say, 
``No, we don't want it,'' really balances the incentive very 
well.
    I think you have done a really good job putting those two 
things together. The offshore states do deserve royalty sharing 
just as the Federal land states, like New Mexico and Wyoming, 
who, as you know, a huge part of their budget is dependent upon 
Federal royalty sharing.
    So, thank you.
&lt;/option&gt;
