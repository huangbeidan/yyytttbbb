    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker=""&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;hearing-info paraId="2" speaker=""&gt;The committee met, pursuant to call, at 9:31 a.m., in Room 
2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Jason Chaffetz 
[chairman of the committee] presiding.&lt;/hearing-info&gt;
    &lt;hearing-info paraId="3" speaker=""&gt;Present: Representatives Chaffetz, Jordan, Amash, Meadows, 
DeSantis, Ross, Walker, Blum, Hice, Grothman, Hurd, Palmer, 
Mitchell, Cummings, Maloney, Lynch, Plaskett, Demings, 
Krishnamoorthi, Welch, Cartwright, and DeSaulnier.&lt;/hearing-info&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker=""&gt;    Also Present: Representatives Graves, Johnson, and 
Richmond.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform will come to order. Without objection, the 
chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The chair notes the presence of our colleagues from 
Louisiana and who are also joining us here, and we appreciate 
the interest in this topic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I'd like to ask unanimous consent that Garret Graves, Mike 
Johnson, and Cedric Richmond be allowed to fully participate in 
today's hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Without objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We had one of the worst natural disasters in this country 
happen again in Louisiana. On August 11, 2016, a no-name storm 
dropped some 7.1 trillion gallons of rain on the Baton Rouge 
and Livingston Parish area. Some areas received up to 31 inches 
of rainfall in just 2 days. That is so unbelievable. It's hard 
to imagine how much rain was falling in such a short amount of 
time. The resulting flood was one of the worst disasters in our 
history, causing over $8 billion of damage and claiming 13 
lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The first responders, friends, and neighbors, including 
Representative Garret Graves, who took his own paddleboard out 
and coordinated to get people help, rescued more than 15,000 
people from the floodwaters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;And, again, we appreciate our representatives from 
Louisiana being here and participating in this hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;There were some 150,000 local residents who applied for 
assistance. Seven months later, estimates indicate that more 
than 45,000 flood victims remain displaced and don't yet live 
at a home. Another 600 families are still living in a hotel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;You know, this is one of the things that my colleague here 
to my right, Elijah Cummings, talks a lot about. We keep saying 
we're ready, we keep appropriating the money, and they're flat 
out not ready to deal with it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Congress responded to this by appropriating $1.6 billion to 
be administered by the State of Louisiana, on top of billions 
available through other programs. The committee sponsored the 
first congressional delegation to the affected areas in the 
weeks after the floods and held a hearing on September 9 of 
2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The committee then returned to the area in February. 
Additionally, we have reviewed more than 80,000 pages of 
documents from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or 
FEMA, and through our field work and document review, we 
discovered significant failures at FEMA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Among the most egregious examples is FEMA's failure to 
deploy in a timely manner. These MHUs, these--again, these 
mobile housing units, are a housing option of last resort for 
flood victims. At the time of the September hearing, FEMA had 
placed only one person in an MHU, despite having 70 MHUs 
locally and sitting on a lot.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I want to show you this graph here. Now, remember, this 
disaster happened in August. This is the deployment of the 
mobile housing units. Twenty-two are out there in September. 
October, 593, but you really don't ramp up until February. 
February. This thing happened in August.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;You can take that slide down.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;These are people who are in desperate need of housing and 
simply had to wait too long. In fact, we still have people that 
are waiting. There are still people waiting in line. It's 
April, and they're still waiting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Unfortunately, the problems with the mobile housing units 
are not limited to the abysmal placement or pace of deployment. 
Let me show you what this--I want to put up this slide here, if 
I could.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;This is from Clayton Homes. Okay? This is--we went online, 
staff did good work. It's kind of hard to see there, but you 
can go online right now, in Louisiana, and that top one, it's 
called the Elation, you can--it says its in stock. They can buy 
it between $26,000 and $45,000, right now. You can just push 
the button and order it. And when we talked to the 
representatives from Clayton Homes this morning, in Gonzales, 
Louisiana, near Baton Rouge, they quoted $3,600 to $10,000 for 
delivery and installation, and they can start today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The Federal Government pays $150,000 for these units, and 
you can go online and buy the nicest one they have for 45 
grand, and for another 10 you can get it there. $100,000 
premium we're paying, and they can't get them to the people 
that are affected for months and months and months on end? Go 
online, for goodness' sake, and you can do a better job and 
save the taxpayers, literally, millions of dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;It's so frustrating to see these people suffer and hear 
their horror stories.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;And, by the way, with FEMA, when they purchased these 
things at $150,000 a pop, we found a pattern of serious 
maintenance issues with them. Electrical issues, clogs, leaks, 
plumbing problems, doors that would not shut or lock, fires, 
and malfunctioning fire suppression systems, HVAC systems that 
were too hot, too cold, didn't work at all, unusable 
furnishings. On average, average, each unit had more than 1.3 
problems with it. Most concerning is the HVAC and thermostat 
issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;In October of 2016, a faulty MHU overheated and killed an 
84-year-old man. In fact, let's put up the slide from The 
Advocate, who had this story that ran. He was baked to death in 
a FEMA trailer. And we have spent considerable time looking at 
the suffering that this man went through and ultimately lost 
his life. FEMA falsely told our committee staff, who was there 
on the ground at an in-person briefing, there had been no 
deaths due to faulty MHUs or any efforts to replace a pattern 
of defective parts. That was absolutely not true.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Shortly after the man's gruesome death, FEMA ordered a 
contractor, Chicago Bridge and Iron Company, to replace 
approximately 1,500 thermostats. Sadly, in the midst of 
recovery efforts, FEMA's priorities were clearly misplaced.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;In an October 31, 2016, email uncovered by the committee, a 
FEMA official writes, quote, ``We have no way to predict what 
this news will do to our operation and how the congressional 
office will use this prior to election,'' end quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;This is not the first time FEMA has placed its own image 
above aiding citizens in need. Ten years ago, the committee 
held a hearing on formaldehyde levels in trailers deployed by 
FEMA in Hurricane Katrina. Then Ranking Member Tom Davis 
stated, quote, ``FEMA's concerns were a legal liability in 
public relations, not health and human services,'' end quote. 
It doesn't seem as if anything has changed since Hurricane 
Katrina.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;FEMA is repeating many of the same mistakes they should 
have learned from Katrina. Additionally, we identified 
pervasive waste of FEMA funded State-run Shelter At Home 
Program. This program allows for $15,000 in temporary repairs 
to a home so flood--so flood victims can remain in their homes 
while finishing repairs. So the contractor gets $15,000, come 
in and do some temporary repairs, then they can stay in their 
home. The biggest beneficiary of this program were the 
contractors who were allowed to make repairs that cost well 
beyond their value. The State reimbursed contractors for 
repairs based off negotiated and--I don't know. Talk about bad 
negotiators--off negotiated itemized on the list. So let's look 
at what we're paying for for basic items.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We went to Amazon.com, we figured out people know what that 
is. You know, pay less than $100 bucks, you can get a Prime 
membership and also watch some videos. These are what Shelter 
at Home Program was paying. Okay? For the two-burner hot plate, 
$120. You can go on Amazon, buy it for $22 bucks. Microwaves, 
$133. You see a long list. The AC unit, $985; you can buy them 
for $249. And guess what? Amazon will deliver it to your door 
for free shipping. And if Amazon doesn't, my guess is every 
retailer that's in Louisiana would also do it to help out their 
friends in need right next door.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We're paying ridiculous prices. We're paying $150,000 a 
unit, and we can't get it to the people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Contractors were also able to charge up to $1,500 to 
quickly inspect HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems. The 
committee has questions, though, about the quality and 
workmanship of these temporary repairs. We met with an elderly 
woman who's replacement sink was attached to her drywall 
instead of into the studs. Let me show you what this looks 
like. This is after the repairs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;If you can put up that slide.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;As she puts it up, the sink fell on her foot resulting in a 
painful and expensive hospital visit. These are far from the 
only problems we've had with the recovery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I don't know if we have that slide there, but this--
basically, the sink was installed, and it just fell right out 
of the wall. And if you just see the surrounding area and what 
it was looking like, it was absolutely just abysmal, abysmal 
conditions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We're concerned about the delays and the State's selection 
of a contractor to manage the $1.6 billion Congress 
appropriated in September. So the disaster happens. Congress 
appropriates money very pretty swiftly, and reports indicate 
that the State bungled the initial award and then restarted the 
process 2 weeks ago. It's April 2017. This happened in August, 
and they just restarted the process. So it's con the 
bureaucracy instead of getting it to the victims.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Furthermore, the estimates are that the contractor who gets 
awarded this is going to get $250 million to administer this. 
Now, there's costs. I'm not saying there's no cost. But you've 
got 600 families that are still in hotels. I can't see a single 
thing that went right with this, except one thing: The men and 
women, the families there in Louisiana, they took care of 
themselves. They helped neighbor to neighbor. They got out 
there and did what it took to take care of it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;But it's an embarrassment for the Federal Government, FEMA, 
and those involved at the State level too that we are here in 
April, and they still haven't solved this problem. And we've 
got real people suffering, and that's--that's why we're having 
this hearing today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    So I'd now like to recognize the ranking member, Mr. 
Cummings, for his statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for holding
this hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;I've often said that--and you alluded to this--when I think 
back at Katrina, it is something that I've talked about many, 
many times, and that was the situation where people who kept 
saying when the rubber meets the road, everything is going to 
be fine. And when it came time for the rubber to meet the road, 
we discovered there was no road.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;The torrential rains that hit Louisiana last August have 
been described as once-in-1,000-year event. Some areas received 
as much as 2 feet of water and rose to record levels. The harm 
inflicted was vast, flooding more than 60,000 homes and forcing 
thousands of families to flee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Today's hearing is an important opportunity to make sure 
that we're doing everything possible to help the victims of 
this historic flood. Our work has been bipartisan. And not only 
do I appreciate that immensely, but I believe it makes our 
committee more effective and more efficient.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;After Hurricane Katrina, one of the key lessons we learned, 
that there were some contractors involved in the recovery 
effort were corrupt. I said it. Some of them were corrupt. Folk 
had their hands out in the matter--in the midst of a disaster 
because they wanted to take advantage of the moment. They did 
not hesitate to exploit the disaster and billed the American 
taxpayers, and they caused additional suffering to the 
residents of the region. In other words, there was pain layered 
on top of pain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;In response, we resolved to hold contractors to account, 
and we pressed FEMA and other agencies to conduct more rigorous 
oversight of their contractors. This is no doubt that things 
have improved, no doubt about it, since Hurricane Katrina, but 
I continue to have serious concerns about FEMA's reliance and 
dependence on contractors, as well as its ability to hold those 
contractors accountable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Let me highlight one example. I think the chairman talked 
about this briefly. Last October, an 84-year-old blind veteran, 
Everett Wilson, was found dead in a manufactured housing unit 
that he was provided after the floods. Apparently, there was a 
malfunction in his thermostat, so the heat kept pumping and 
pumping and pumping. When Mr. Wilson was found dead, it was 130 
degrees in his unit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;As part of our investigation, our staff spoke to Mr. 
Wilson's caretaker. She told us that the thermostat was 
malfunctioning as soon as Mr. Wilson moved into the unit. She 
said she called repeatedly to get help, and that the 
maintenance repairman came out to his unit. However, she said 
he claimed he was not qualified to fix the heating and air 
conditioning system, so he left. And nobody else, apparently, 
returned after that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;However, we've obtained internal documents showing that the 
company has a terrible record of documenting its maintenance 
calls and responding to maintenance requests. Approximately 1 
month before Mr. Wilson's death, a FEMA official warned CB&amp;amp;I, 
and I quote, ``I have seen at least 20 problems with your 
subs,'' end of quote. He wrote, quote, ``Please drop the hammer 
on these guys,'' end of quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;In addition, our staff reviewed the company's maintenance 
records in the weeks leading up to Mr. Wilson's death, and they 
showed that CB&amp;amp;I received at least 25 calls from other 
residents about heating and air conditioning problems in their 
units. These problems did not get fixed before Mr. Wilson's 
death, and they did not get fixed in the months afterwards. 
When the rubber meets the road, no road.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;For example, on January 4, a FEMA acquisitions quality 
assurance specialist sent an email to a FEMA Federal 
coordinating officer expressing concern that in December alone, 
CB&amp;amp;I received 1,980 maintenance calls, and I quote, ``The 
contractor only completed 198 of those, thus, 90 percent not 
completed,'' end of quote. Rubber meet the road, no road. That 
is 9 out of 10 calls the company failed to address.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;CB and CI--CB&amp;amp;I also missed or failed to complete 40 
percent of its monthly inspections of these manufactured 
housing units. According to the same email, quote, ``Repeat 
caller''--and I quote, ``Repeat caller complaints that go 
without maintenance attention are numerous,'' end of quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;So you had Mr. Wilson, who basically became collateral 
damage. That's right. I worry that more and more people in our 
country, because there is a lack of empathy, a lack of 
professionalism, a lack of responsibility, a lack of decency, 
allow others of us to become collateral damage.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;So on January 16, a Federal coordinating officer at FEMA 
emailed his colleague warning that, and I quote, ``CB&amp;amp;I's 
maintenance subcontractor continues to struggle,'' end of 
quote. And that the company was providing, and I quote, 
``substandard performance,'' end of quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Today's--2 days later, on January 18, FEMA sent a letter of 
concern to CB&amp;amp;I expressing, and I quote, ``concerns about your 
current trend of performance.'' The letter highlighted problems 
with, quote, ``completing and reporting of backlog maintenance 
work orders and nonresponse to repeat calls from FEMA 
applicants.'' So I'm assuming somebody is getting some money, 
but nobody's performing the work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;The documents we have obtained show that this contractor 
has a terrible, terrible record, and this demonstrates why 
aggressive oversight is so critical and so crucial.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Finally, Governor Edwards, I want to thank you for 
testifying here a second time, as well as for the testimony 
that you provided about the value of the Shelter at Home 
Program, which temporarily repaired more than 10,000 homes and 
saved countless neighborhoods from abandonment. This vital 
program can be improved, and I believe you would agree with 
that, based on the experiences of Baton Rouge. And we look 
forward to hearing from you about how to make productive 
changes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;I want to thank all of our other witnesses for being here 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the bipartisan effort. 
And with that, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I thank the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I also ask unanimous consent that the letter of concern 
issued by FEMA as highlighted in your opening statement as well 
as the article from The Advocate that I highlighted in my 
statement, that both of these items be made part of the record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Without objection, so ordered.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We will hold the record open for 5
legislative days for any members who would like to submit a 
written statement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;But now, we would like to welcome our witnesses. We're very 
pleased for the cooperation and the accessibility for the 
Honorable John Bel Edwards, the Governor of the great State of 
Louisiana, for being here again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We thank you, sir, for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We also have Mr. Robert Fenton, Jr., acting administrator 
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, often referred to 
as FEMA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We have Rear Admiral David Boone, president for the Chicago 
Bridge &amp;amp; Iron Federal Services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We thank you, sir, for your service, but we also thank you 
for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;And we have Mr. Mark Harrell, emergency coordinator for 
Livingston Parish, Louisiana. Somebody who is truly on the 
front lines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;And, sir, we thank you for all of your efforts, and we 
thank you for your candid testimony here today. So I want to 
proactively thank you for being here as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Pursuant to committee rules, all witnesses are to be sworn 
before they testify. So if you'll please all rise and raise 
your right hand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you're 
about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth, so help you God?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Let the record reflect that all witnesses answered in the 
affirmative.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;In order to allow time for proper discussion, we would 
appreciate it if you would limit your oral testimony to 5 
minutes. Your entire written record and any supplemental items 
will be made part of the congressional record as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;But if--we have lights there. As my colleague, Trey Gowdy, 
likes to say, it's green, go; when it's yellow, speed up; and 
when it's red, you've got to stop. So if you could just make 
sure you move that microphone nice and close and hit the button 
as you go along, we'd appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;Governor, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;Governor Edwards. Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member 
Cummings, members of the committee, good morning and thank you 
for the opportunity to be here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;Since I was last here testifying before this committee, the 
Louisiana congressional delegation and I discussed with you and 
your colleagues, as well as the Obama and Trump 
administrations, what it would take to give the people of 
Louisiana a full recovery. These conversations have been 
extremely productive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;First, I want to thank you for the $1.6 billion 
appropriated thus far, and I'm grateful for the time this 
committee staff has taken to visit Louisiana to better 
understand the challenges we are facing. I'm also grateful to 
be invited here to discuss how to improve and speed up the way 
the Federal Government responds to natural disasters.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;The historic March and August floods were the fourth most 
costly flood event in United States history, with over 112,000 
of homes with FEMA-verified loss. Understanding the scale of 
the destruction is critical to any conversation about recovery 
and where we go from here. Just as important is an 
understanding of how Federal regulations have hindered our 
ability to get the assistance we need for the people of 
Louisiana. Prior to and throughout the immediate response of 
the 2016 floods, FEMA was a very good partner, but the 
transition from response to recovery is where challenges arose.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;Since I took office as Governor last year, 57 of 
Louisiana's 64 parishes have received Federal disaster 
declarations, home to 85 percent of the State's population. The 
waters may have receded, but their mark remains in living rooms 
and schools and shops around the State. The State has worked 
around the clock to act as quickly as possible within the 
parameters set by Federal regulations, and yet we know there 
are still improvements we can all make, which is why we are 
here today, as there are lessons to be learned from every 
disaster.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;You have specifically asked me to talk to you about Shelter 
at Home. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, we saw entire 
communities turn into ghost towns. St. Bernard Parish, a suburb 
of New Orleans, lost more than half of its population. Families 
were broken apart, businesses closed, and many students and 
teachers never returned to their classrooms. After last year's 
flooding, it was important to us not to let that happen again. 
However, many of the challenges that plagued the recovery from 
Hurricane Katrina still cause problems today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;We looked to programs used around the country and lessons 
learned from other devastating events, such as Superstorm 
Sandy, with the objective of holding communities together, like 
Livingston Parish. We studied New York's version of FEMA's STEP 
program. We decided that a restructuring of that program was 
our best opportunity to prevent repeating what happened in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;Our version of STEP known as the Shelter at Home Program 
provided a cost effective temporary housing option, given that 
hotel, motel, and rental stock was insufficient even before the 
storm and was greatly reduced due to flood damage, and also 
because manufactured housing units were not readily available. 
The purpose of Shelter at Home was to create a safe, secure, 
and habitable home with a minimum of one operational bathroom, 
running water, a functioning kitchen, and working heating, air, 
hot water heater and electrical outlets among the list of 62 
repair items, while homeowners made long-term permanent 
repairs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;Without the Shelter at Home Program, we would have been 
forced to put thousands of families in hotels, mostly outside 
of their home towns and even outside the State, at a much 
greater cost, roughly $40 million per month for the 11,000 
families who used Shelter at Home.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;However, we encountered numerous challenges within the 
Federal process that limited the assistance we were able to 
provide homeowners. For instance, there are certain repairs 
that make a house look and feel like a home, such as insulation 
and sheetrock on the exterior walls that were not permitted 
under Federal guidelines. While we did request to expand the 
program and include these repairs, we were denied.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;Expectations, understandably, were often far above the FEMA 
restrictions we were bound by, and early on we struggled to 
communicate that effectively to homeowners. Knowing that the 
repairs were often austere and primarily of a temporary nature, 
we began carefully outlining to homeowners, before the work 
began, what the scope of work would include.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;Simply put, TSA and MHUs don't fill the need. STEP is too 
limited, but you can help. For example, consider carving out an 
exception to the duplication of benefits language in Title 42 
and form an incorporating step into FEMA regulations under the 
public assistance program, category B. This will allow States 
to have prestorm contracts in place so that implementation time 
and program costs are reduced greatly. But this is just one 
example. There are numerous adjustments both on the regulatory 
side and within statute that would give States the flexibility 
to provide a more robust and timely recovery for our citizens.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="HON. JOHN BEL EDWARDS"&gt;I look forward to continuing with this conversation today, 
as I know we have a shared goal of expediting and improving the 
overall recovery process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF ROBERT J. FENTON, JR.&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ROBERT J. FENTON"&gt;    Mr. Fenton, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;Good morning, Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member
Cummings, and members of the committee. I'm Bob Fenton, acting 
administrator of FEMA. Thank you for inviting me here today to 
provide an update on our Louisiana recovery operations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;I began my career at FEMA in 1996, and since then have been 
deployed to more than 50 disasters across the country, some of 
the largest in the last two decades, including the World Trade 
Center on 9/11, Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi, and Hurricane 
Sandy in New York. During my 20 years in this business, I have 
learned many truths about disasters and helping survivors 
during and following their worst days.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;First, every disaster is different. They have different 
causes, different consequences, different survivors, different 
communities, each with varying levels of resiliency that bring 
their own unique requirements and challenges.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;Second, in response to disasters, we can be cost effective, 
precise, or fast, but we can't be all three. Time is a 
commodity that I can't replace, but at FEMA we strive to 
support survivors as quickly and effectively as possible, and 
are constantly seeking better, more effective ways to serve.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;Serving the people of the communities of the United States 
is what motivates me, the men and women at FEMA, the dedicated 
professionals working in emergency management across the 
country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;The historic flooding in Louisiana in August of 2016 
dispersed tens of thousands of survivors from their homes. Even 
though the waters receded, many survivors found their homes 
completely destroyed and themselves in need of shelter while 
their communities are rebuilt.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;FEMA remains committed to Louisiana recovery. Since August, 
we have approved more than $764 million in individual 
assistance, obligated more than $325 million of an estimated 
$677 million in public assistance. FEMA provided the needed 
housing to roughly 90 percent of the survivors within 6 months. 
Communities recover more quickly and completely when survivors 
find their sense of normalcy post disaster, when kids go to 
school with their friends, families attend their regular 
church, and people return to work. By keeping survivors close 
to their communities, we can help them get back to their lives 
more quickly and the community recover fully.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;When a disaster devastates the entire housing market, 
including rental and hotel properties, finding housing options 
close to survivors' homes presents a challenge. Survivors' 
housing needs are met through a combination of insurance, loans 
from SBA, and rental or repair systems from FEMA. FEMA's 
authorities alone will not make survivors whole. And FEMA 
assistance by itself cannot rebuild a family's home as it was. 
Our authorities do allow us to make minimal repairs through 
programs like Shelter at Home to get survivors back into their 
own home or provide temporary housing through hotels, rental 
properties, or manufactured home units, also called MHUs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;In providing temporary housing, our preference is to use 
existing housing stock, which is, more often than not, the most 
cost effective and efficient way to get people into temporary 
housing. However, there are occasions when a survivor needs are 
best met with one of our MHUs. In disasters, a large number of 
displaced persons and limited availability of rental 
properties, MHUs fill a critical gap. When MHUs are used, FEMA 
has an obligation to ensure they are safe and durable. We build 
MHUs to HUD standards to be deployable to any environment in 
the United States. We also coordinate with local governments to 
meet their codes and ordinances and to insure that utilities 
connect. And finally, we provide a 24/7 maintenance line to 
survivors at move-in and are available to address any concerns 
they have about their MHU. We inspect them monthly to ensure 
they are all well maintained.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;However, tragically, in October, Mr. Everett Wilson, one of 
our disaster survivors, passed a way in a unit we provided. 
FEMA takes the loss of Mr. Wilson seriously, and I take it 
personally. I have met with the State director and the 
Louisiana Governor several times. My first trip after assuming 
this role was to visit Baton Rouge to see for myself the status 
of our recovery mission.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;As I said when we began, in disaster response, we can't be 
cost effective, precise, and fast, but that doesn't mean we 
don't try. Since assuming this role, I have directed our staff 
to look at new, out-of-the-box solutions to improving our 
housing program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;At the end of February, we hosted a housing summit to 
identify and evaluate alternative options, and based on their 
recommendations, I instructed them to work with academic 
institutions and industry to identify new innovative solutions 
to disaster housing. Providing housing for survivors after a 
disaster is always challenging, but we work every day to find 
better, more effective ways to accomplish our vital mission and 
to provide a consistent high level of service to all survivors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;Mr. Boone, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;Admiral Boone. Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member Cummings, 
Congressman Graves, and members of the committee, I appreciate 
the invitation to be with you today to discuss CB&amp;amp;I Federal 
Services' role in the Baton Rouge flood disaster recovery. I 
ask that my full statement be made part of the record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;My name is David Boone, and I'm PRESIDENT of CB&amp;amp;I Federal 
Services. Prior to joining CB&amp;amp;I in December of 2013, I served 
for 30 years in the United States Navy. I was a civil engineer 
corps officer and a Seabee. Those 30 years provided me with an 
exceedingly rich source of perspective. My transition from a 
military officer to president of this company has turned out to 
be a very natural continuation of my career as both demand the 
highest levels of dedication to the American taxpayer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;During my Navy career, I participated in many disaster 
response missions. When we received this task order from FEMA, 
I was very anxious and determined for our organization to 
respond well in performing its mission in relieving the victims 
from the misery of the disaster. We provided a focus of 
resources and leadership to ensure success of our mission.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;I believe our team was highly successful in this endeavor. 
We serve the U.S. Government. We serve those who the U.S. 
Government serves. And in this particular case, we faithfully 
assisted and continue to assist victims of one of the worst 
flood events in the history of our country. We are proud of our 
work, but make no mistake, this is difficult work, and at times 
it's heartbreaking work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;Our company has provided disaster relief assistance to FEMA 
since 2005, and we have successfully completed over 100 task 
orders. After Hurricane Katrina and Rita, we dewatered New 
Orleans, patched roofs, and set up many thousands of housing 
units for citizens who had nowhere to live.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;On May 8, 2009, FEMA awarded CB&amp;amp;I Federal Services a 
contract to provide disaster recovery services on task orders 
to be issued as needed over the life of the contract. CB&amp;amp;I was 
evaluated and awarded as the best value of all the competing 
contractors. That, in turn, resulted in FEMA assigning CB&amp;amp;I 
Federal Services to the southeast region, which is the most 
disaster-prone region in the United States. CB&amp;amp;I was determined 
by FEMA to be the most qualified emergency response contractor, 
and its rates were determined to be fair and reasonable to the 
U.S. Government.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;Baton Rouge is not just a job site for CB&amp;amp;I Federal 
Services. It's our home as well. We have several offices--
office locations in the Baton Rouge area. We have employees who 
have lost everything. We are members of this community. For 
much of our staff, this is home, and it is personal to us. We 
are not just a contractor that came to this area in response to 
the flood. Many of our employees live and work in Baton Rouge 
and personally suffered as a result of the flooding. I 
personally walked those neighborhoods. I saw the piled up 
personal belongings. I held and cried with employees. This was 
personal to us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;I'm also proud to say that many of our employees responded 
to help others as volunteers, and our company gave them the 
opportunity to continue working as volunteers. A number of our 
employees were part of what became known as the Cajun Navy, 
serving to rescue people with their personal watercraft. So 
when we knew that there was a potential for our company to 
receive this task order to do the best--to do this work, our 
employees were motivated to do the best possible job to make a 
difference and help those devastated by disaster. It amazed me 
that we had employees that lost everything back at work within 
days striving to help others get back on their feet and support 
others.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;I thank you, Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings, 
for the invitation to be here today. Currently, we have zero 
work in backlog related to installation under this task order. 
We have received only positive comments and glowing accolades 
from FEMA at all levels about our performance under this task.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;Congressman Graves, we will stay in your district until the 
job is done. We are your constituents, and together we will 
help our friends and neighbors get back on their feet.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="REAR ADMIRAL DAVID BOONE"&gt;As I said at the outset of my testimony, I take the task of 
serving my fellow Americans very seriously, and I ensure that 
everyone who works for and with me does as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MARK HARRELL&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MARK HARRELL"&gt;    Mr. Harrell, you're now recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harrell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, committee. I
appreciate this. I would--I also want to thank you for 
recognizing Livingston Parish as being a part of this flood. I 
provided some inundation maps for you. Ninety-four percent of 
our folks suffered, 94 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;I'd like to move on to information sharing. Constantly, we 
run into resistance with FEMA on the individual assistance 
side. Our council, our parish president, everyone, gets calls 
from our citizens wanting help because they can't get through 
to the hotline with FEMA. It's ridiculous. So when we try to 
follow through and help our citizens, we're constantly told, 
that's a Privacy Act. We cannot give you this information. What 
are we to do? I ask you to please look into this, make some 
changes. Every emergency manager in the country should have 
access to this information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;Secondly, our hazard mitigation. It is one of the, I'm 
going to say, the best programs that FEMA has to offer. We're 
building safe rooms. We're doing everything with that. We're 
doing drainage. One thing that I faced a problem with for the 
last 12 years is trying to build a warehouse for our 
commodities to help our citizens. It was in there, and then in 
2009, it was taken out where we cannot build, do any new 
construction with hazard mitigation funding, unless it's a safe 
room. So I ask you to please look into that, see if we can 
change policy to where that can be offered again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;Also, we would like the ability to use hazard mitigation 
funding for commodities. Let us buy our meals, ready to eat, 
water, couch, blankets, hygiene kits. That saves you from 
having to haul them all over the country to get them to us 
weeks later. So help us help ourselves.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;And I would like to point out right now, in 1 year's time, 
Livingston Parish is the only parish that had a Federal 
declaration three times. All three disasters, we're the only 
one. So you understand why we need to do some reform with FEMA. 
It's going to help everyone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;At one time, the Federal coordinating officer, once he was 
appointed, could make decisions in the field. He could use some 
common-sense approach, change some policy, move forward with 
things. In the last 10 years, that has not happened. Everything 
must come from the Federal coordinating officer all the way 
back to Washington, DC be delayed for weeks and weeks or 
months, and then we still can't move forward with anything. So 
we could have made a lot of decisions in Baton Rouge at the 
joint field office had the Federal coordinating officer been 
allowed those opportunities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;The MHU program, as you stated, is definitely flawed, and 
I'm going to leave it at that. There are other opportunities. 
There's other ways to do better with this. It's simply issue 
the State or issue the jurisdiction that's affected and declare 
it a block grant. Let them handle the housing. I mean, it's got 
to get much easier. As you stated, we can buy mobile homes 
local if we need to. There's all kinds of opportunities if you 
provide it to the locals and let us do it ourselves.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;First responder agencies throughout the country suffer from 
the fact that if a responding agency comes in to assist--and 
understand, Livingston Parish, Ascension, EBR, it was a war 
zone, just like it was during Katrina. We had first responders 
from across the country and the northern part of the State come 
in to help. We can't seem to get a project worksheet worked out 
to where we won't have to cover 100 percent of it. Just--and 
there's nothing prohibiting that, but we just need to look into 
this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;Lastly, I would just like to say that I've met resistance 
on public assistance on our roads. And Mr. Cummings brought up 
how the roads were inundated with the homes earlier. Ninety-
nine percent of our roads was under water for 7 to 10 days. 
However, when we--excuse me--when we talked to FEMA about it, 
they say, we have nothing that we can help you on unless we can 
see the damage. I've provided you with some backup 
documentation that proves otherwise. I'm asking you to please 
help us get FEMA to respond to that. And it's not only a 
Livingston Parish issue. This is across the country. Everyone 
faces it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;And then I'd like for you to look at something that 
happened after Katrina that helped the school systems, NFIP. 
And it's in my packet.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;[Prepared statement of Mr. Harrell follows:]&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="[Prepared statement of Mr. Harrell follows:]"&gt;    Thank you for your time. I'm here to answer any questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Thank you. Appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    We'll now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Hice, 
for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;Governor, how many did the--how much did the Shelter at 
Home Program cost?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. We haven't--I'm sorry. Sorry about that. 
We--Congressman, we have not closed out the program yet.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;How much did it cost so far?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I think about $157 million. We're 
expecting $164-,$165 million by the time it closes out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;All right. How much did you receive in Federal
funds?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. For the Shelter at Home?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;Well, for the disaster as a whole.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, we--well, it's hard to answer. The 
Shelter at Home funding is coming from FEMA with a cost share 
from the State.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;I think you mentioned it a while ago, 1.6 billion
was approved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Yeah, the chairman mentioned that. That's 
for the CDBG piece. It's been approved. We have not received 
the funding yet.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;How much money has been distributed to those
affected by the flood?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Out of the CDBG? None.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;Okay. Let me--you did not call for an evacuation.
Is that correct? When the report was coming the flood was on 
the way, what--did you call statewide an evacuation?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I don't know that we called for a 
statewide evacuation, other than in those low-lying areas where 
we asked people to move before the roads became impassable.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;As I understand, the National Weather Service was
predicting this was going to be a storm, the damage of which 
floods would go beyond that of 1983. Why would you not call an 
evacuation?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Yeah. I'm not sure the National Weather 
Service said that in advance of the rain falling. And, in fact, 
this was not a storm that we would typically have in Louisiana 
where you have a tropical storm or a hurricane.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;From what I understand, the National Weather
Service made that prediction. Well, let me put it this way: Did 
the State do everything that you could to prepare for the 
flood?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I am convinced that we did a very good 
job, in fact, working with FEMA, as I said earlier, before and 
during and in the immediate aftermath of the storm in terms of 
the response. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;So you would give yourself what kind of grade?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. A high grade. I mean, I don't--I don't 
think anything is ever perfect. And, certainly, we learned 
lessons, but I would give ourselves a B plus, something on 
that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;A B plus with this kind of horrible outcome. That
sounds like a very generous grade when there's--there's so much 
destruction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;How many people are still--have permanently still been 
displaced from their homes?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;Governor Edwards. Well, I don't have the number for how 
many are permanently displaced from their homes in terms of not 
back in today, because there are multiple programs to--that 
provide relief for homeowners, including the National Flood 
Insurance Program. And I'm not sure where they are in terms of 
getting claims paid and homes repaired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    We do know that there were 112,000 homes with FEMA-verified 
loss, and that's a very significant----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;But you don't know how many of those homes have
been repaired or how many are back in their homes?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I do not know across the board. I know 
that there are far too many homes that are not repaired, and we 
have too many people who are not living in their homes, which 
is--which is one of the reasons that I'm here today and 
continue to come back asking for additional assistance.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;Is it true that you were at a fundraiser in
Colorado when the National Weather Service was calling for a 
flood in your home State?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. No, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;It's not true?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. No, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;Where were you?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I was in Colorado at a Democratic 
Governors' Association conference.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;Okay. When did you return?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. That afternoon. The Friday afternoon. The 
same day the rain started.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;All right. Is it true that days following the
flood, you told a media reporter that the State was not in need 
of Federal flood resources?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I don't believe I would have said that. I 
would have said that we--there wasn't anything that the local 
governments were asking for that we were unable to provide.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;From what I understand, the comment was made that
you did not need any Federal resources. I was wondering why you 
would make such a claim with such a devastating flood.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, I think the--if I recall correctly, 
the conversation was around requesting the Federal disaster 
declaration. We were working with the regional coordinating 
officer from FEMA to determine the most appropriate time to 
request that declaration. And one of the things you have to 
certify with my signature is that the local governments are 
asking for assistance we are unable to provide. It wasn't until 
that was the case and I was able to make that certification 
that we requested the declaration, which we received very, very 
promptly.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hice&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;Well, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;But, Governor, with all due respect, it looks to me like 
one disaster led to another disaster from decisions coming from 
the State. I cannot imagine how you would give yourself a B 
plus in this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Hice"&gt;    But with that, Mr. Chairman, I thank you, and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We'll now recognize Mrs. Demings of Florida for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Mrs. Demings. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and also, 
thank you to our ranking member.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Mr. Boone, I want to ask you about--or share with you an 
example of your company's unacceptable performance from 
January. As I described this almost unbelievable series of 
maintenance failures, I would like to remind everyone that this 
happened to a real person.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;This happened to an elderly woman, who had already been 
dispatched from her home by a flood before she ended up living 
in this manufactured housing unit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;First, the sprinkler covers in the unit fell off the 
ceiling and hit the woman, cutting her face. She was lying in 
bed. CB&amp;amp;I dispatched a technician, but that person was not able 
to fix the problem. There was zero followup. And then a couple 
of weeks later, the CB&amp;amp;I inspector told the resident that she 
should no longer cook in the unit. He said the heat from the 
cooking range might cause the still broken sprinkler system to 
flood the trailer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Unfortunately, it got worse. At 9:30 on January 18, nearly 
a month after the sprinkler fell from the ceiling, the 
resident's unit began to flood with water from the toilet and 
the sewer. She called the CB&amp;amp;I maintenance line again to report 
this active flooding, and she was told that someone would call 
her back shortly. The flooding started about 9:30 a.m. By 6:30 
p.m., CB&amp;amp;I still had not sent any help.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Mr. Boone, what is your response to this?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Admiral Boone. My response--sorry. My response is that's 
unacceptable performance. I wasn't aware of those set of 
circumstances, and we should address them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Mrs. Demings. You testified that you subcontract out the 
maintenance of these units. Is that correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Admiral Boone. Yes, ma'am.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Mrs. Demings. Have you fired any of your subcontractors for 
their poor performance?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Admiral Boone. We have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Mrs. Demings. Mr. Boone, how do you conduct oversight of 
your subcontractors to ensure that they are performing this 
very--the very important duties in an acceptable manner?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Admiral Boone. We have a quality management program not 
only for our subs but for our own CB&amp;amp;I work that manages the 
quality of performance that we're providing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Mrs. Demings. So if that be the case, Mr. Boone, how could 
this unfortunate incident even be possible, since you're saying 
you provide oversight?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Admiral Boone. I don't have an answer to that question. I'd 
have to dig into the specifics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Mr. Fenton, how can FEMA exercise oversight of 
subcontractors in a more effective way?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;We do that through a number of ways. We have a
contractor's officers technical representative that overseas 
the prime, and then have project officers that oversee the 
whole operation the contractors are doing. And that is where we 
are aware of issues, we work through the prime to make changes 
based on what those issues are. And there's a set of escalation 
activities that would happen over the course of the contract, 
and we would go through those according to the regulations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;    Mrs. Demings. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Would the gentlelady yield? Would the
gentlelady yield?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Mrs. Demings. Yes. Yes, I will.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    I want to go back to--Mr. Fenton, I want you to address 
some of the concerns that Mr. Harrell----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harrell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;--when he was talking about--when the
chairman put up a chart with all those--the differences in the 
prices we could get things from Amazon. Talk--can you talk 
about that a little bit? He said there were several times 
when--certain situations where it would have been better if the 
locals--am I right, Mr. Harrell? --were allowed to do certain 
things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Are you--is it that you're handicapped by regulations, Mr. 
Fenton? You remember--you remember the discussion, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes. So I think, specifically, he had a number
of issues going across a bunch of different programs that we 
have. But, specifically, with regard to our individual 
assistance program, it's direct assistance from FEMA underneath 
section 408 that we provide. Following DM82K, we lost the 
authority to go ahead and do direct grants to States and local 
governments. So the assistance flows from us to the individual, 
which is, I believe, the issue that's--that the gentleman is 
bringing up with regard to the ability to share information. 
When we have personal information of survivors, we're limited 
to what we can share as far as their personal information.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; I'll get to that one. But what about the
pricing? Talk about the pricing and what the chairman talked 
about a little earlier, the Amazon comparison.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;Sure. Sure. I don't know the specifics, whether
we're comparing apples to apples or apples to oranges or 
whether the model numbers are correct. We'd have to look into 
that and do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;    We purchase based on what is--to ensure habitability, to 
ensure safety of the items we're purchasing. Usually, we 
purchase to a higher level because of the ability to track 
items----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Well, my time has expired, but I just--those
comparisons that he made or contrasts are glaring, and I don't 
think that your response just now meets the level of adequate 
response, but I'm sure we'll get to that later.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    We'll now go to Mr. Mitchell of Michigan. You're now 
recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Governor Edwards, the Shelter at Home Program was put in 
place to allow for an alternative for residents to get 
temporary repairs to remain in their home versus the cost of 
manufactured housing units and all the others things. One of 
the concerns, though, is when the survey was done this past 
December, over 2,000 people, one-fifth of the homeowners that 
use the Shelter at Home Program, 46 percent of them said that 
they would not return home; that, in fact, they were concerned 
about the shoddy repairs and questionable living conditions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;How are you resolving that given that you've given yourself 
a B plus grade?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Governor Edwards. Well, in terms of the number of folks who 
have not returned to the home after Shelter at Home was 
completed, I would tell you that the 80 percent, assuming 
that's representative of the entire 11,000, represents a 
tremendous cost savings and largely acknowledges that the 
program was successful in keeping people in their communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    Further, for some of the folks who didn't move back into 
their homes proper because the Shelter at Home actually 
restored a functioning restroom and electrical service, they 
were able to move travel trailers and other trailers onto the 
property even though they weren't provided by FEMA, they 
weren't MHUs, and they were able to live on the properties but 
not in the house while they were able to do the permanent 
repairs.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Let's talk about cost----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    Governor Edwards. And we also made sure that the houses did 
not suffer mold or animal infestations, which would render them 
even a bigger problem for the homeowner going forward.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Governor, 46 percent of the people chose not
to move back in. But let's talk about cost-effectiveness.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;The Shelter at Home price for, for example, electrical 
assistance, inspection repair, an invoice that was done that in 
fact the work was not done, the family did themselves--I should 
say, electrical systems inspection test, not repair, was over 
$500. Now, I just completed a 3-hour home inspection, 3 hours 
inspector stayed and tested all the receptacles, opened up the 
panel, tested two units, heating and cooling, went up on the 
roof, I could give you the list, he spent 3 hours. Do you want 
to guess what that cost me?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    Governor Edwards. No, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;$625. $625. Just to test the electrical
system cost the Federal Government, 10 percent paid by the 
State, but the majority by us, the Federal Government, $527. 
How do you justify some of the prices? I mean, pest control. 
They put in a $10 container of bug spray from Home Depot and 
the charge was $425. Heck of a contract.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Yeah. And, Congressman, the only thing 
that I can tell you is that we quickly set up a program modeled 
after the New York STEP program and made sure that we brought 
in enough contractors where they would competitively bid, drive 
the cost down. We then used Xactimate in order to individually 
price the 62 repair items and drove the price down further.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;By bringing these contracts, how did it drive
down the price, when, in fact, I made a phone call through a 
realtor that referred me to a gentleman, and it was $625? I 
didn't have to bring in a whole lot of contractors to get 
competition. I mean, how is it that we got--how did that work?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, I think the nature of the program 
was a little different when we were looking at, at that time, 
as many as 20,000 homes, and we ended up doing a little less 
than 11,000.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;But we paid in this instance just to inspect
and test an electrical system over $500. I mean, I understand 
the scale is different, but the reality----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    Governor Edwards. But, Congressman, my point was we had 
multiple contractors who were bidding costs. We then analyzed 
those costs. We drove them down even further using the 
Xactimate to make sure that we did reduce the overall cost of 
the program. And would we have liked to have reduced it 
further? Yes, we would have. But at the end of the day, the 
cost of the Shelter at Home Program was much less than the cost 
of putting them in hotels or motels.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Well, let me----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Certainly a mobile--manufactured housing 
units, which really weren't available.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Before I retired, I was a State and Federal
contractor at points in time, and I have better than--those are 
quite nice contracts in terms of the markup that the chairman 
noticed on some of the materials: $525 to test an electrical 
system. And, frankly, if 46 percent of the customers that I 
worked with failed to succeed, they'd have terminated my 
contract.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;How many contracts did you--how many contracts did you 
terminate out of the build--the home program?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;Governor Edwards. I don't know how many we terminated in 
terms of the construction contractors. I do know that we moved 
some work around and took some work from some who were being 
slow and gave it to other contractors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    But I will tell you, with respect to the chairman's 
pricing, you should note that the prices he mentioned did not 
include the cost of labor or the insulation materials on those 
things, which----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Mitchell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;But it did include Amazon Prime, Amazon
dropping them off at their doorstep, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;My time has expired, but one comment for you. With all due 
respect, sir, I suggest you reconsider the grade of B-plus 
because, in my view of this, the Shelter At Home Program 
reflects a lot of failures, and I wouldn't grade it a B-plus. 
Thank you, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    We'll now recognize Ms. Plaskett from the Virgin Islands 
for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member,
for holding this hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;FEMA, of course, we understand is very important and the 
work that their contractors do for communities who are in these 
flood areas and who are in--have natural disasters are 
paramount. So I am here not just speaking on behalf of those 
communities, such as my colleagues Congressman Richmond and 
Congressman Graves, but my own community in the Virgin Islands, 
as well as Florida and the Southeast.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Admiral Boone, I want to ask you about a statement that you 
made this morning. It's in your oral statement as well as your 
written statement. I'm going to quote you as having said, ``We 
have received only positive comments and glowing accolades from 
FEMA at all levels about our performance under this task.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Admiral Boone, would you stand by that statement?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Absolutely. So, during the events, we 
obviously were ramping up to address the tasking we were 
getting from FEMA. So, on a continuous basis, I asked my vice 
president of operations and the project manager----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;And who would those individuals be?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Larry Hauser and Kevin Neal.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Okay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. --who had a recurring and regular 
relationship with FEMA officials, for feedback on what their 
perception of our performance was. And so we, as late as a week 
and a half ago, continue to receive very positive comments.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Well, that's a problem to me on a couple of
levels: one, that you would state that continuation of positive 
comments and glowing accolades, and particularly, as you 
mentioned, Kevin Neal as being someone--I believe he--we have 
him listed as your senior project manager, correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Yes, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Because our--the committee received documents
from you, and we have an email of September, dated September 27 
of 2016, and that's from FEMA's Region VI branch director, 
Robert Jones, addressed to Mr. Neal. And in that email, the 
FEMA branch director wrote, and I quote, ``Please get your 
crews in line so that we are able to move forward with these 
issues with minimal issues. Today, I am scrubbing my emails, 
and I have seen at least 20 problems with your subs. Please 
drop the hammer on these guys because their performance does 
not look good on you and your reputation that you and your team 
have established.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Have you seen that email? It's up there for you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. No, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Because that's an email that your company
submitted to us from FEMA to Mr. Neal, who is telling you that 
he's getting glowing comments from FEMA. Do you view this email 
as positive comment or an accolade?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. No, ma'am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;I didn't either. So why was it necessary for
FEMA to send this email to your company and tell you to drop 
the hammer on your subcontractors?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. I don't know. I haven't seen the email and 
the total context of the issue. So that's something to be 
looked at.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Well, we know from our investigation that
we've had several issues. We heard from Congresswoman Demings 
about the woman that was an unfortunate victim. We also have 
information about another person who had--Mr. Everett Wilson, 
an 84-year-old blind Air Force veteran who was found dead in a 
housing unit because of a malfunctioning thermostat that CB&amp;amp;I 
was supposed to have replaced back in August and October 2015. 
So you know about those issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. So the thermostat was not to be replaced 
prior to his passing; that came out afterwards, just to be 
clear on that issue.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;But we know that thermostats needed to be
replaced, correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. We didn't receive that direction from FEMA 
until into October.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Well, in a meeting after Mr. Wilson's death,
CBI told FEMA that you had replaced at least 40 thermostats in 
the week immediately preceding Mr. Everett's death, did you 
not?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. I don't know that fact.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;So if you--you knew that thermostats needed
to be replaced. Maybe his was scheduled to be replaced after 
his death----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. We didn't----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;--but you had been replacing other
thermostats before his death.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. We didn't know about the thermostats until 
after his passing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;You didn't know what about the thermostats?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. The replacement. We didn't receive direction 
from FEMA until after his passing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;But why, then, would you have replaced 40 of
them before his passing?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Perhaps those thermostats were discovered 
defective on an inspection. I don't know about the----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Forty?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. I don't know----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;Not one; 40.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. I understand.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;So, obviously, you had some schedule of
replacing them before his death.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. There were 3,000--well, at that point, I 
don't know how many trailers. But I don't know the specifics of 
that. So I can't answer that question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt; Okay. I'm sorry. I've exhausted my time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Will the gentlewoman yield?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Following up, both CB&amp;amp;I and FEMA, we
have asked you for the emails relating to this issue. You have 
not provided those in their totality to this committee. I need 
you to both tell me when we're going to get those emails.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Mr. Fenton?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I was told that any email with regard to this
incident was provided to you. If that's not the case, I'll go 
back and----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; We don't believe it is. We believe that
production is incomplete.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Okay. Well----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; We need you to come back to us and tell
us when we have 100 percent of the documents that we requested.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I'll personally go back today and make sure you
receive everything. There's nothing that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Appreciate it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; --we're going to hold. We'll give you
everything that we have.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Appreciate it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Mr. Boone?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Chairman, we received notification only last 
week to provide----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The letters went out on March 21----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;--which is not just last week, but keep
going.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Admiral Boone. We have provided over a million pages in 
documents in various forms and formats. So we will continue to 
work as diligently as possible. I've devoted resources and 
focus to this. So we're continuing to work this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;So the question is, when are we going to
get 100 percent?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Admiral Boone. I'll have to go back to staff and see what--
but we're working this as diligently as possible.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;You did give us a fairly sizeable
document dump of invoices and individual things, but this is 
something we specifically have asked for, and I just want to 
make sure Ms. Plaskett and the whole committee gets these as 
well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;You'll get us an estimate on the date of
that?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Okay.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt; And, Mr. Chair?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Yes. Go ahead.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt; I would just want to know if Mr. Boone,
Admiral Boone, at this time would like to retract that 
statement that he had made previously, which is on the record 
under oath. I don't want him to get himself in trouble at this 
point.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Which statement?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;About having had only accolades and good
words from FEMA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt;    Admiral Boone. I can only attest to the feedback that I 
have received. Obviously, you've presented some information I 
haven't seen before. So I'd like the opportunity to review that 
before I make any changes to my statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; Would the gentlelady yield?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Plaskett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Ms. Plaskett"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Mr. Boone, your company has a problem. If I
were running your company and I had these kinds of problems and 
something did not flow up to me, the very things that could 
destroy my business, there's something wrong with the company; 
there's something wrong with the management. And it might be 
you, but there's something wrong.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Anyway, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The gentlewoman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    I would now recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. 
DeSantis, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DeSantis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"&gt;Mr. Fenton, I just want to ask while I have you here, we 
obviously suffered damage on the East Coast of the United 
States. I represent Florida. The Stafford Act has the public 
assistance program that can fund replacement of sand on damaged 
public beaches under certain conditions. And we currently in 
Florida have the State and then localities working to secure 
funding to restore some of the dune structure prior to the next 
hurricane season.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"&gt;    It's a tough process. We have partners who are kind of 
ready to go. Can you commit to really working to streamline 
this so that whatever we can get lined up, we can get lined up 
before the next hurricane season, when there's some significant 
safety concerns?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I'm not aware of the specific situation. I am
aware of policies to replace sand on beaches, that they have to 
be engineered. Typically, my experience is what holds it up is 
environmental and other requirements in order to go ahead and 
move forward on that. But I'll look into your specific issue, 
sir, and make sure that we're moving as quick as we can with 
the authorities to go ahead and repair that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DeSantis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"&gt; Yeah. I appreciate it----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DeSantis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"&gt;--because there's been significant damage to
some of the dune structure such that, if we do have another 
major storm surge, I mean, there's much less protection. And I 
think it could be corrected, but obviously we need to get our 
ducks in a row.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"&gt;    The other issue I think people have run into is the debris 
removal and getting the reimbursements. The guidelines that 
FEMA has are very confusing to a lot of our local folks, and we 
work with them as best we can, but it's a cumbersome process. 
And I was wondering, do you think there are ways that either 
Congress could revise the Stafford Act, or can FEMA revise its 
guidelines for debris removal so that we can avoid some of the 
delays in reimbursements? Because some of the local 
governments, it will take years for them to get reimbursed, and 
it's tough for them, because they don't have a credit card like 
the Federal Government does.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;So debris in public areas, public rights of
way, is eligible. And, basically, what we require is monitoring 
so that we ensure that what we're providing is what was 
removed, reduced, or eventually put into landfills or other 
means. I think where it becomes difficult is when we start 
talking about debris removal on private property, and that 
becomes the issue. And typically it's--we based our rules on 
what the local ordinances are and declaring that it's a public 
health threat in order to move it off there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;    So our authority applies to public rights of way, public 
areas. It has to be an imminent threat to public health and 
safety to remove that. I think it's pretty easy when you're in 
that area. When you get into private property, it's more 
difficult. And we've done a number of things to provide 
guidance, training to make sure that we've made our rules more 
simple for private property debris removal, which is usually 
the more difficult.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. DeSantis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"&gt;Well, if you guys can, you know, work to
proactively relay that and try to alleviate some of the 
confusion, I think that would be helpful, because I think that 
there are these issues where they're just trying to figure out 
what they got to do. They want to get rid of it. They're going 
to front money, but they want to at least know whether it's 
going to be eligible for reimbursement. So I appreciate that. 
And if you can follow up with me about the dunes, we'd 
appreciate that very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"&gt;    I'll yield back the balance of my time to Mr. Chaffetz.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Governor, how many people are still
displaced?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Chairman, I am not certain, as I sit here 
today, how many of our homeowners are not at home. We know that 
there are, I think, 250 families still in hotels and motels. We 
know that there are a number of individuals who, for example, 
under the National Flood Insurance Program either are starting 
to work or haven't had their claims paid yet, and they are 
trying to get back in as well.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;But do you have a guess as to how many
people are displaced?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I don't have a guess. I would be able to 
perhaps----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Governor----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Governor Edwards. --get you the information. We have a 
number of individuals, for example, who are living with family 
members, and so it's--to get you the number is very difficult. 
We know that there are thousands of families not yet living in 
their homes. I can give you a more precise answer after we do 
some analysis and we look at it across the various programs.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Governor, you know how bad that looks,
right? I mean, you are coming here for a hearing about this, 
and you don't even have a guess as to how many people are 
displaced?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I do not.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;You're that clueless?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I'm not that clueless. We have a lot of 
people in homes that are not yet fully repaired. A lot of 
people are not in homes----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;A lot.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;A lot. What does that mean?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, you know, it means a great number. 
It means too many.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Come on, Governor. Seriously.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Mr. Fenton, what's your estimate?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; If--I believe 4,500 people staying right now in
mobile homes. You have less than 2,000 that we're providing 
rental assistance to right now. You have the 250 the Governor 
talked about that are still in our hotel program, and then I 
believe there is some population that's still with friends and 
families. And that's the population that we will get a better 
handle on as we start doing case management with individuals 
that still have housing issues that we're going to work with 
them to figure out what assistance they need to ultimately move 
back into their homes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Mr. Harrell, what--tell me what it's
like right now.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harrell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;Well, let's talk about the number of folks
that are still not in their home. Let's go back to number one 
on my testimony: information sharing. I don't have a clue. I 
want to know how many. I want to know where they stand. FEMA is 
out doing the assessments with all their teams. They're telling 
me they're doing great things. I know nothing about it because 
they will not share with me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;    It is our citizens. It's my responsibility to make sure 
they're taken care of, but we're out of the loop. I can't tell 
you how many. I wish I could.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Okay. Mr. Fenton, why don't you tell
him?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Well, we can't share specific information on
individuals due to Freedom of Information----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; What do you mean Freedom----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I mean, not Freedom. With regard to their
personal information, and we can't share their personal 
information and their specific status. However, through the 
case management----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Why not? Why not?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Because it's personal information, and we can't
go ahead and give that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Well, I'm not suggesting you print it in
the paper.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Mr. Harrell?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harrell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt; If we can't do it on individual assistance, is
what he's saying, however, when we do the Hazard Mitigation 
Grant Program and do elevations and acquisitions, they send a 
list with the allocation and say, ``This is the folks that 
qualify for the program,'' their name, their address, their 
phone number. We have to process every bit of their private 
information. So what is the difference in the Hazard Mitigation 
Grant Program after the storm and not letting me have it during 
the disaster, where we can maybe get it to private nonprofit 
groups that maybe could help these citizens a little bit more?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Okay. I've gone well past my time. We've
got to continue to explore that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Mr. Fenton, go ahead.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I meant to say Privacy Act. I'm sorry.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;That's fine. I understand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    All right. Let's now recognize the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania, Mr. Cartwright.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Governor Edwards, we're here talking about the historic 
flooding that hit Louisiana and the Baton Rouge community in 
August 2016. Congress appropriated about $437 million on 
September 29, 2016, for the victims of the flooding in 
Louisiana.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;This committee, the Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee, has received a letter from the Trump administration, 
dated February 14, 2017, from the General Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of HUD commending you and the State of Louisiana on 
your quick work in developing an action plan on how to use 
those funds. The letter states, and I'm going to quote: ``The 
Department would like to commend the State for its commitment 
to increasing the speed of recovery. This is evidenced by the 
historically fast action plan submission,'' unquote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Now, Governor Edwards, I want to ask you: How long did it 
take you to submit that action plan that you were commended 
for?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Governor Edwards. Well, it took us 17 days after the 
Federal Register notice went out to submit that action plan. 
And this ties back in with some of the information and 
questions we got earlier today. There have been two 
appropriations that total $1.6 billion. Both action plans were 
submitted, the first one 145 days ahead of the deadline and the 
second one 8 weeks ahead of the deadline. And the money 
actually became obligated yesterday when HUD signed and 
completed the execution of the grant agreement. The money is 
not yet available because the line of credit has not yet been 
established. That typically happens several days, maybe a week 
or two, after the grant agreement, which answers the question 
of the chairman and others as to why none of the $1.6 billion 
has yet reached homeowners; it has not been available.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;But if you look, it is historically fast. In fact, the 
timeline associated with this said the $438 million would 
typically be available in May. It was available--it should be 
available much sooner than that. And in terms of the second 
appropriation, it would be July. But it was folded into the 
grant agreement with the first appropriation and should be 
available much, much sooner than that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    And I'd also point out that the other grantee States in the 
September appropriation have yet to submit their first action 
plan.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Well, all right. So, not to put too fine a
point on it, while your actions have been very quick, it's 
obvious that you've been frustrated by the State's inability to 
distribute those funds. And, again, would you explain for us 
what obstacles your State has faced in distributing this money 
to the victims of the flooding?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Governor Edwards. Well, in that way, I share those 
frustrations with you and the chairman and others, and nobody's 
more frustrated than the homeowners in Louisiana. But to say 
that the State was delaying or dilatory in the way that we 
approached this would not be true, as evidenced by the letter 
we got from HUD, for example, that called our work historically 
fast. But there is a huge bureaucracy that still has to be 
negotiated. There are lots of hurdles that you have to overcome 
and obstacles you have to go through in order to access the 
funding, but we are in the position now with the money finally 
obligated yesterday, on Monday of next week, we're actually 
going to stand up the program in terms of a call center and a 
survey that will go out to the affected homeowners and should 
be able to proceed without delay going forward. And that is the 
good news.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    We still have about a billion dollars of unmet need on the 
housing piece alone, which we're hoping some or all of that 
will be appropriated in the next continuing resolution.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Governor, did the State of Louisiana have
the resources to front this money and then seek reimbursement 
from the Federal Government later?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    Governor Edwards. No. I wish we had. My predecessor left me 
with a $2 billion State general fund deficit for the current 
fiscal year, and the budget is more than tight. We certainly 
did not.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;Well, Governor Edwards, I commend you and
the State of Louisiana for taking charge of the lengthy process 
of seeking disaster aid for the Baton Rouge community. Your 
administration acted swiftly and decisively. We in Congress 
really ought to take a page out of your book and focus on 
making processes faster here in Washington as well. Thank you 
very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Thank you, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cartwright&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Cartwright"&gt; I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    I now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. 
Meadows.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Governor, I'm confused. You are there pointing the finger 
at someone else, and you can't answer the very basic question 
of how many people are not back in their homes, and you're 
somehow pointing towards a previous administration on your 
inability to answer even the very basics of questions, 
Governor? How is that?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I think the comment I made about the 
previous administration had to do with----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;So let me ask about this administration. Why
did you cancel a $250 million flood recovery contract just a 
few days ago?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. We didn't issue the contract. We pulled--
--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Why did you cancel it?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. We didn't cancel it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Well, according to my documents, that you
canceled that on March the 16th, 2017, and you basically--
because Mr. Bankston had an opinion that it needed to be 
canceled.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, there was no contract issued. We 
pulled back the RFP. We reissued the--we started the process 
over again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Why did you get rid of that particular vendor?
Because what I understand is, is they had submitted a proposal, 
it was going forward, and one person, Larry Bankston, somehow 
said that there was a problem there, Governor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, I think that's inaccurate. The 
licensing contract board voted to adopt that opinion as its 
own. At that point in time, the first two finishers in----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Does Mr. Bankston's son work for a competing
contractor in that?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. You know, I've heard that. I'm not 
certain.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;So how can you be so certain about some
aspects of this, Governor, and yet seem to have no recollection 
on the facts and the questions that we have to ask here this 
morning?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, first of all, I think I had a 
pretty good handle on the facts and----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;So how many people are displaced?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, I've answered that particular 
question as best I can.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;No. Well, you haven't answered it. You said
you don't know.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I said as best I can this morning, I've 
answered it for you, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;So were you surprised that you were going to
be testifying here this morning?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. No, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Then why would you not have the--I mean, we're
talking about real people's lives here, Governor. And if you 
have a compassionate bone in your body, wouldn't you think that 
you would know the number of people that have been affected by 
this?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I know the number of people who have been 
affected, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Still.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. The question is how many people are out 
of their homes today. And we don't have any information where 
we can roll that up and know how many people--we know how many 
are, obviously, in manufactured housing units; we know the 250 
who are in----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;So do you believe that you are without blame
of any of the responsibility of getting people in proper 
housing in the appropriate manner, that you are completely 
blameless in all this, Governor?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I would never say that I'm completely 
blameless. And, in fact, I said we've learned lessons; we could 
do things better. And hopefully there----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;But you were sitting there comparing your
norms to historical norms.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, I was quoting a letter that----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;And sometimes when you compare to historically
bad things, that doesn't mean we're making much progress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Congressman, I was quoting a letter that 
came from HUD that said we were historically fast in the State 
action plan submission and approval. That's a fact.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;All right. Well, we want more information on
exactly why this RFP was rescinded and if there was a conflict 
of interest, because some of our information would indicate 
that there might have been. And I'm not asking you. I'm asking 
you to get back to this committee to help illuminate that 
particular idea, because if there's a conflict of interest 
because of bidding improprieties, that's a major concern to 
this Oversight Committee. Wouldn't you agree it should be?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, it should be if that happened. The 
RFP was pulled back----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;So you're saying it didn't happen?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. I said ``if that happened.'' I didn't say 
whether it did one way or the other.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;All right. But you'll find out and get back to
this committee?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Sure. We will find out----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Okay. Thank you. Let me go out a little bit
further, because I'm out of time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;Mr. Fenton, let me tell you: I have a good relationship 
with FEMA. We've had major storms of North Carolina. I love my 
FEMA people. But let me tell you: Something I saw today just 
stinks to the core. We've got emails that would suggest that 
the number one priority that FEMA had was a political 
motivation prior to an election that says, and I quote: We have 
no way to predict what news will--this will do to our operation 
and congressional offices will use prior to an election.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    Wouldn't you think the major component for FEMA would be to 
get people in housing and make sure that that housing is safe, 
and it has nothing to do with political consequences?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt; All right. Well, let me go even further,
because that was troubling enough, but this is extremely 
troubling: a FEMA document where it talks about the number one 
priority for FEMA was negative publicity. Should that be the 
number one priority?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; No, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;All right. So let me show you what the lowest
priority was, and this is from your document. And this is very, 
very troubling, because the lowest priority, tier 3 is what you 
have, which it says, ``lowest priority,'' and it has to do with 
mobile home units issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;It says: Status, we have an applicant calling stating that 
they have a 2-year-old special needs child who has desperate 
need for surgery but can't get surgery until they have a stable 
living situation instead of their 30-foot camper. The child is 
very sick, and they have nowhere to go at this point, and they 
need--an MHU is needed as soon as possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    And you had it as a low priority, tier 3? What in the world 
could have put this as a low priority?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Sir, my priority is survivors. And I don't know
where that document came from, but I'm going to find out after 
this, and I'll make sure that we change the--whoever wrote its 
priorities.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Meadows&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;I would suggest that we quit looking at the
political motivations and start taking care of people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Meadows"&gt;    And I'll yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I concur.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I thank the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    We'll now recognize the ranking member, Mr. Cummings.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; Mr. Fenton, my experiences with FEMA have
been very good, as the gentleman from North Carolina. And I 
assume that that is not your position, that low priority 
situation there, because all of my dealings, I've found them to 
be very responsive.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; No, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; And--hello?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; No, sir. That's--my priority is survivors. My
priority is not that document. I don't know where that document 
came from, but I'll resolve it when I get the document and I 
get back to my office.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Thank you. Yes, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;On October 25, 2016, Everett Wilson was found dead in his 
housing unit because it turned into an oven due to a broken 
thermostat that blew heat nonstop. He was 84 years old, blind, 
and served our country in the Air Force, a veteran. What we 
don't know is why Mr. Wilson's broken thermostat was never 
fixed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;As part of our investigation, our staff spoke several times 
with Mr. Wilson's caretaker. She told us that, in the weeks 
leading up to Mr. Wilson's death, she repeatedly called for 
maintenance help. In response, she says a maintenance person 
was dispatched to Mr. Wilson's unit, but he said he was not 
qualified to fix HVAC systems and had no one else--and that no 
one else ever came.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Mr. Boone, according to your written testimony, and I 
quote, it says: ``FEMA contracted with CB&amp;amp;I Federal services to 
transport, install, and maintain mobile housing units for 
approved disaster victims,'' end of quote. Is that right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Mr. Wilson's unit was one of those units that
you were contracted to transport, install, and maintain. Is 
that right?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Your attorney sent a letter to the committee
on March 29, 2017, and it stated, and I quote: ``The 
maintenance call logs included for this production reflect the 
fact that there was not a single call made to a call center 
regarding the trailer on Lot 5, nor were there any calls 
associated with the name of the applicant.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Are you telling us today under oath that your company never 
received a single call from Mr. Wilson's unit, the veteran that 
I just talked about, the one who died because he roasted to 
death, I guess, or do you believe that it's possible that your 
company did receive a call that may not have been properly 
logged?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. We----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;It doesn't sound like you're getting all the
calls, as I stated a little earlier. Go ahead. I'm listening.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. What you said is correct. We never received 
a call on either his unit, Lot 15, or anything referencing Mr. 
Wilson's name.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Okay. Our staff reviewed the maintenance call
logs, and there were numerous errors in the weeks before Mr. 
Wilson's death, including incomplete names, phone numbers, and 
addresses. In the weeks right before Mr. Everett's death, our 
staff found at least 25 work orders for heating and air-
conditioning issues. They sound a lot like what we heard from 
Mr. Wilson's caretaker. They describe defective HVAC systems 
and systems continuously blowing hot air. Two of these work 
orders say that the technicians dispatched to the sites were 
unable to perform the repairs and had to call for other 
technicians to perform them. That sounds almost exactly like 
what we heard from Mr. Wilson's caretaker.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Now, Mr. Boone, were you aware before October 26 that there 
were issues with thermostats in some of these mobile units?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. I was not aware of the numbers. It's not 
uncommon to have system breakdowns, and so we do the 
maintenance and repair as required.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;And you're based down there in Louisiana? Are
you based there?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. I am based in Alexandria, Virginia.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Okay. And so--but this is a big contract for
you. You've made a big deal of how you knew a lot of the people 
and----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. We have offices down there, yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;So do you feel that your company has any
responsibility here?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Directly related to Mr. Wilson's death, no, 
sir. Obviously, some information's been presented here that we 
need to look into.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;So you don't think there's anything you could
have done better?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. We----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Your company could have done better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. We did what was required by the contract. 
We're interested in working with FEMA to see if there's any 
patterns that could be improved.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;So you said you did what was required by the
contract, and an 84-year-old man is dead, and your company was 
responsible for making sure his unit was operational, and you 
don't even know that you're getting correspondence from below, 
but you did nothing wrong? But he's dead. Dead.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Sir, I appreciate the seriousness of that, 
absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Mr. Boone, do you commit to providing all the
documents that have been requested by the committee?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Have we provided?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; I said, do you commit to--apparently you told
us you had sent in a million. How many--I mean, do you have 
many more that we need to--that we need to have access to?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Will the gentleman yield for a second?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; Yes, of course.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I want to follow up on what Mr.
Cummings--before we get to the document production, I want to 
follow up on this for a second.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;You gave yourself a--you said you're highly successful, Mr. 
Boone. On January 4 of 2017, FEMA officials circulated an email 
pointing out that you, the contractor, had a completion rate 
for December of 10 percent--10 percent. How do you say you're 
highly successful when only 10 percent of the maintenance calls 
you actually complete?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Well, again, I haven't seen that document. I 
haven't seen the context of that communication. I've never 
seen----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Mr. Fenton, is that true? Did FEMA put
that out that only 10 percent?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I'm not aware of----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Come on, guys. Get aware. The Governor
doesn't know how many people are displaced. You don't know how 
many maintenance calls are being missed. You don't--you call 
yourselves highly successful. The Governor gives himself a B-
plus. And maybe the reason you're not responding to all the 
maintenance calls is because you put the wrong maintenance 
number on the trailers. Correct? Correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I'm not aware of----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; You're not aware of that either.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; No.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; You provided the documents to us. We
actually read them. Maybe you should read your documents. You 
all together decided to combine one telephone number, ``Hey, 
let's make this easier.'' Sounds good. Guess what? The sticker 
you put on the trailers, wrong telephone number. No wonder 
you're not getting any calls. You put the wrong telephone 
number there. And then the people who still figured it out, 
CB&amp;amp;I only responds to 10 percent of them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; What I was referring to, as far as not knowing
the 10 percent in the specific letter you're looking at, when 
we wrote to CB&amp;amp;I, we wrote in our letter that a concern of 33 
percent of the calls have no response information. So that's 
what I am aware of of the letter that we generated over there, 
but I don't have specific knowledge of the email that you're 
talking about.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; Let me----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;You know, the chairman and I have done a
number of things on a bipartisan basis, a lot, and one of the 
things that we spent a lot of time on is the Secret Service. 
And both of us agreed that we wanted excellence. We wanted high 
standards. We wanted the elite of the elite. We wanted people 
to be treated--we wanted Secret Service agents to treat their 
jobs as if they were the most valuable jobs in the world and 
that every single thing that they do is so very, very 
important.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;And I just think--I just--and I say that to say this, that 
sometimes I think we in our country in certain areas are moving 
towards a culture of mediocrity, but that mediocrity can cause 
people to die and to suffer. And I've got to tell you: 
Information is very important. I don't even know how you 
operate without information, and adequate information, Mr. 
Boone. And so I'm just--some kind of way, you got to get a 
handle on this, or I don't see how you--how a company can 
continue to function and really make money and stay in business 
unless you have information and then unless you're operating to 
a high--a very high standard.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    With that, I'll yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I thank the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    We'll now recognize the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Palmer.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt;    Mr. Fenton, what does FEMA do with their excess mobile home 
units?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Some of them--depending on the condition, some
are retrofitted and brought back to the yard for future 
deployments. Sometimes we go through the GSA excess schedule, 
and GSA excesses them for us through their schedule. And in 
some case----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; What does that mean? What does through the GSA
schedule? What does that mean?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; It means that we sell them at the location that
were there, that they're at, that it's----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; What's the average cost of one of these mobile
home units?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I'm sorry? Again?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; What's the average cost of one of these mobile
home units?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I believe the average cost is somewhere around
$60,000.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; And what is GSA selling them for?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I don't know. It ranges.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt;I'll tell you what they're selling them for.
They're under $11,000. Sounds like a pretty bad deal to me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt;    Let me ask you this: Are any of the used units offered to 
State and local governments?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; And how do you do that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Going through the GSA excess schedule. It goes
through a number of steps, where we look at purchasing, the 
potential for--to go to States, local governments, nonprofits 
eventually. So you go down that. It's in the GSA regulations of 
how to access accountable property.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; How does GAS contact a State emergency
management agency? Could you--I mean----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; They put it out. There is a website----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; They post it on a website?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yeah. They post it. And typically, my
experience, having done this before, back in Region IX where 
I'm from, is typically any time we're doing that, I make the 
State emergency management--notify them where we're headed with 
that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; So, when you have excess mobile home units, you
contact GSA first?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes. We contact GSA because that's the entity
within the government that then has the authority to excess 
property either through sales or through eventually providing 
it to States or local governments, yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; So you don't contact the States to let them
know?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I--personally there's communication that we
make them aware of it, but officially, GSA's the one that puts 
out the information.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt;Well, the committee heard from several States
this morning that they've been looking for mobile home units 
for donation and have been told that you're unable to find any. 
And just 2 weeks ago, GSA was selling 20 units at auction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt;    You know, I've been sitting here listening to the questions 
and your responses, and one word keeps popping up: incompetent. 
It's unbelievable. I mean, you got States looking for these 
units. You got local governments looking for them. They can't 
get any from FEMA. They're not getting them from GSA, but 
you're selling units that average $60,000 or $70,000--and some 
of them are a whole lot more than that--for $11,000, at a 
terrific loss to the taxpayers. And, I mean, you guys look like 
the gang that can't shoot straight.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; If I could answer, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; You may if you can.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yeah. So we purchase them for $60,000. When
they get used, they're depreciated based on the amount of money 
it takes to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; You're selling some new units.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I'm not aware of new units that we're selling,
sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; I looked it up while I was sitting here
listening to you. There are some listings for new units.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Okay. Well, we take--what we do is we look at
the value that they're at, the cost to retrofit them, the cost 
to bring them back to the yard that we would be at, and then 
figure out the cost to sell them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; Well, how do you respond to the fact that
States this morning, including the State of Alabama, contacted 
the committee and said, ``We've not been able to get units''?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; We have to go through the process with GSA to
see if we could sell them first. If they're not--if no one 
wants them on that market----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; Wait a minute. You have to see if you can sell
them first----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; --before you would donate them to the State?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; That's right. Yeah.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; And you can't offer--you can't give the State
the option to buy a unit? In.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yeah. The State can buy the unit, but it would
be through that same process. Just recently I did a mobile home 
program in California where we ended up giving 70 mobile homes 
to the State of California. So we----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt; Say that again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I said back in my region, Region IX, before
being Acting Administrator for the last couple of months, I had 
a mobile home program in California from the fires, and we 
ended up providing 70 mobile homes in California in that event. 
So, in that event, after we went through the mobile home 
program and we had mobile homes returned and we had excess that 
we ordered, we went ahead and, rather than ship them back to 
Selma, we went ahead and provided them to the State of 
California, which were used on another fire through the State.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Palmer&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt;Well, again, listening to the testimony this
morning, it's disturbing to me, Mr. Chairman, that a Federal 
agency has failed in so many respects. And I think maybe we 
need to look at this process, we need to make some corrections 
and see if we can't be a little bit more responsible, well, 
actually, a lot more responsive to the State and local 
governments when they have needs like this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Palmer"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I thank the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    We'll now recognize the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. 
Graves.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;I'd like to thank you and Ranking Member Cummings for your 
time and effort here on this flood. This is not something that 
is just relegated to Louisiana. This, unfortunately, is a flood 
disaster that is going to have repercussions around the country 
on many folks if we allow this type of incompetence to 
continue. This is not the first flood, yet in many instances, 
it appears that some of the reactions to this makes it look 
like this is the first disaster we've ever seen as a country, 
and it's awful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Mr. Fenton, I'm not sure what--Administrator Fenton, I'm 
not sure what grade you give FEMA. I've ridden out disasters 
with you all before. The performance I've seen here is one of 
the worst, unfortunately, one of the worst I've ever seen, and 
I think it absolutely has exacerbated the impact on the flood 
victims.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Specifically, when you look at what happened after the 
flood, community members came together, and, I mean, literally, 
I watched people give their shirts off their backs because 
people had just wet clothes, because they came out in a boat or 
whatever else, literally took the shirt off their back, 
literally took food out of their freezer, literally housed 
strangers in their homes, businesses, churches, elsewhere. This 
disaster would have been so much worse if it were not for the 
amazing people that came together to rescue one another and to 
help one another recover. And, unfortunately, when FEMA came 
in, we saw an abrupt halting of that progress and restoration 
following this flood. And, unfortunately, that's continuing 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Let me go back and clarify a few things. Governor, you and 
I, I think, are on different pages in regard to the timing on 
some of this stuff, and I want to make sure we get that sorted 
out. I looked on your website, and I see where on--let's see. 
It looks like your first post in regard to the flood is on 
August 12, and it looks like GOHSEP's first post on the flood 
is on August 19. No. Excuse me. August 16, which was, again, in 
both cases, after the flood.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Number two, there were about 20 watches, warnings, and 
other things posted by the National Weather Service prior to 
the flood in regard to--in regard to the warnings that the 
flood was coming. I actually got so frustrated, that I spent 
over an hour sitting in my office going through all the river 
reports and everything that were out there, and while there was 
a lapse between when I sent the email and it actually got 
posted up on our Facebook, I was warning people that this was 
going to far exceed the 1983 flood and that folks needed to 
evacuate or be prepared for those flooding conditions. And this 
was before the flood, obviously. And so there was ample 
information out there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;But a few things. Now, the contractor that you're hiring 
right now, that contractor is going to be responsible for 
financial controls and procurement and disbursing money and 
things along that line. Is that accurate?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Governor Edwards. On the----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;The contract. You're going through a
solicitation process right now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Governor Edwards. The CDBG.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Yes, sir. I'm sorry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Yeah. I'm sorry. And by the way, I don't 
believe I ever said there were no forecasts of heavy rains. 
There was nothing on the order of magnitude of 30 inches that 
were forecast. In fact, the best we could tell, it was--10 
inches was the most that they had forecast came in ahead of 
time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;I don't remember the exact inches that they
predicted, but they clearly predicted it was going to be beyond 
the 1983 flood, and so I just--but we can move on from there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;So answer me, on the CDBG contract, am I correct in that 
financial controls, procurement, disbursing of funds and things 
along those lines?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Governor Edwards. We were--the contractor--the process 
we're under right now is to select a program manager. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;And under the solicitation that I saw, it
appears they're responsible for financial controls.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Okay. Because I just wanted to make note that,
in the Federal Register notice that was published on November 
21, it actually says that the grantee has to submit 
certification documentation providing the basis that the 
grantee has sufficient financial controls and procurement 
process, and established adequate procedures to prevent 
duplication of benefits and things along those lines. So the 
fact that a contractor is not in place now does potentially 
impede some of that progress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Number two, when we met on August 19, I suggested to you 
then that you go ahead and hire a program management contractor 
and you begin collecting data from flood victims and others, so 
we're ready with this implementation plan. I further suggested 
that you review the Federal Register notice from both the South 
Carolina flood and the West Virginia flood. I might have 
mentioned a third one, but I know I mentioned those two floods, 
because I expected that there would be little to no difference 
between the Federal Register notice that was published on 
November 21 and the previous notices that were published 
several months before our flood. And in reality, in looking at 
the notices, that's the case. They're virtually no differences; 
just very minor differences that wouldn't have had any impact 
on an action plan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;And as a matter of fact, you stated earlier that it was 17 
days after that plan, but as I recall, I think you actually 
submitted your action plan on January 3 for the November 21 
notice. And also I want to make note that the funds were 
actually appropriated, I think it was around September 30. It 
was the end of September.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;And so if you had simply hired a contractor back in August, 
if you had--if you had collected the information, if you had 
reviewed the previous Federal Register notices, you could have 
submitted a plan even before this November 21 deadline because 
every place in here--you can see the several highlights in 
here--every place in here, it actually says that the 
certification documentation submitted within 60 days of this 
effective date of notice or when the grantee submission of its 
action plan, whichever is earlier, and so clearly that could 
have happened before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;And then the other thing, you keep saying that the--that 
the State is in no way delaying the execution of these funds or 
disbursement of these funds to flood victims. There's not a 
contractor in place. There's not a mechanism to disburse funds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Governor, look, you and I represent the same people. And I 
was very concerned on Friday when you suggested that I was 
doing this for politics. We represent the same people, 
Governor. And I'm going around meeting with these people, who 
are literally living in tents, living in uninsulated homes, 
don't have their businesses opened up. Livingston Parrish has 
an article in the paper talking about the number of people that 
aren't reapplying for business licenses. I don't have any 
desire other than to get people back in their homes, and I'm 
simply venting that frustration from them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Do you care to respond?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Governor Edwards. I'm happy--I'm certainly happy to 
respond. First of all, the submission of the State action plan 
for the first $438 million appropriation was historically fast. 
And we can look and say, ``You could have possibly done this.'' 
The fact of the matter is it was historically fast.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    The second submission was even faster and, in fact, fast 
enough that the grant agreement included both of those 
appropriations, but that money is still not yet available. The 
money became obligated yesterday, Congressman----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Governor, you had Mr. Cartwright earlier cite
the February 14 letter. This approved the first $438 million. 
If a contractor was in place, the funds could have been 
distributed based on the $438 million. The State made----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Governor Edwards. That is not true, Congressman. That is 
not true. You cannot distribute money before you have it. We 
don't have it because the grant agreement----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Because you submitted an amendment and told
them to combine the December and September appropriations, 
which delayed it, Governor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Governor Edwards. Which is also not true. We didn't tell 
anybody to combine it. We were asked by HUD to combine the two. 
Once we got the second action plan submitted so quickly as an 
amendment to the first one, they believed it made sense to 
combine the two. We said we're okay doing that but not if the 
first appropriation is delayed, but by speeding up the 
availability of the second appropriation, which is exactly what 
happened. That first appropriation, under the original 
timeline, wasn't going to be available until sometime in May. 
We executed the grant agreement on it this past Friday. It also 
includes the second appropriation. So now we have the $1.6 
billion available all at one time, which is going to be very 
helpful to address one of your earlier concerns that I share 
about low to moderate income and the percentage of homeowners 
that we're going to be able to help beyond that category.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    But it's historically fast. The money is not yet available. 
There is nothing we could have done before today that would 
have made the money available to put into homeowners' homes in 
terms of repairs before the line of credit is established.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Governor, it says, ``whichever is earlier.'' It
says it all over the notice, ``whichever is earlier.'' You 
didn't have to wait for this. You could have based it upon the 
previous Federal Register notices, which I suggested to you 
back in August. And to say that the funds were not delayed as a 
result of the decision to combine, that's just not true. It's 
not. The notice is here. You would have had a line of credit 
for $438 million that you could have begun distributing. 
There's not a contract in place, and there's still not one in 
place. And when the line of credit's ultimately available, 
you're not going to have a contractor in place or a 
disbursement mechanism in place to get the money out the door.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, first of all, I don't know that we 
know that yet because it isn't established. And it could happen 
at any time, as I understand, over the next week or 2 weeks, 
potentially 3 weeks, but----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;But you don't have a contractor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Governor Edwards. But there is nothing that we could have 
done that would have made that money available any faster.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Congressman Cummings.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Yes. Thanks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Governor, I just want to--sorry we're going back and forth 
here. I have just one question. As I'm listening to you, it 
sounds like what you're saying is that you did everything you 
could to get the money as fast as you could, and the 
combination allowed you to do that. Is that right?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Governor Edwards. Well, it does. And the other thing that I 
would like to point out again, the other State grantees that 
were appropriated money in September have not submitted their 
first action plan. We've actually submitted two. And the second 
appropriation was then consolidated with the first one in terms 
of that grant agreement so that we executed the grant agreement 
last Friday. HUD executed it yesterday, and so, for the first 
time, the money is actually obligated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    But if you look at the normal timeline associated with 
this, Congressman Cummings, that first appropriation would not 
have been available in a line of credit until sometime in May.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Okay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Governor Edwards. We're going to beat that deadline, and at 
the same time, we will have the full $1.6 billion, not just the 
first $438 million.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I'll now recognize myself.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Governor, to say that this is historically fast, I mean, 
come on. It's April. This thing happened in August of last 
year. If you have documentation from HUD suggesting that you do 
something--to combine or that something that would slow this 
down or--please provide that to this committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I think it's a combination of failure at the State level, 
but I think there's also a lot of failure at the Federal 
Government level, and I want to try to--and I know Mr. Cummings 
and others feel this way too. This is--as Congressman Graves 
was talking about, this is not the first time these things have 
happened.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Mr. Fenton, Congress appropriates how much money to you on 
an annual basis? Just an annual appropriation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Including DRF and--so just for the Disaster
Relief Fund, I think it's $7 billion, $8 billion a year, just 
the Disaster Relief Fund, and then plus we have money for flood 
insurance, which is mostly through the policies, and then 
another couple billion on top of that. So----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; So you're about $15 billion?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yeah, about $15 billion when you add it all up,
all the different----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; And I got the tell you: $15 billion a
year to do what? Be ready if there's a disaster. Were you ready 
for this one?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Well, we always can do better. And I think
you've pointed out a number of areas where we can do better. I 
think what happens in the bigger events, in the large--these 
large events, whether it be this event in Louisiana or Katrina, 
that it maximizes our capability and the throughput that we 
have. So, when our throughput for mobile homes is about--I 
think, on average, the best I saw was about 41 a day--it 
doesn't meet the huge numbers when you have 4,500 people, 
ultimately, that needed mobile homes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Okay. So let's put that chart back up on
the mobile housing units. This event, we have this chart. I 
mean, those numbers don't ramp up until the end of the year. 
And they don't even get close to what we need until February.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; So our focus immediately is to put people in
rental properties, if available, into hotels, and then start to 
determine--and we're also working the TSA program with the 
shelter--the STEP program with the Governor. And so we're 
getting people into safe, habitable locations outside the 
shelters, and then we start working through those individuals 
to determine their requirements, and at the same time start----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; If you think--if you think you can do,
you said, I think, 41 a day?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Forty-one a day with the infrastructure all
being intact: power, water, sewer----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; In perfect conditions. I mean----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; So 41 a day is what we got up to. Right? It
takes some time----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; It took you, like, 6 months to get to
that point.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; It takes some time to get the infrastructure
and resources there in order to meet that level.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;You can take down the graphic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    If we paid you nothing, and we just said, ``Hey, Louisiana, 
here's a bunch of money; go help fight this disaster,'' Mr. 
Harrell, what do you think would have happened?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harrell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt; Quite honestly, I probably would have failed
miserably, but at least it would have been me failing instead 
of pointing fingers at someone else. I would have liked to have 
the opportunity to do that, any day of the week, because I feel 
like I failed the people of Livingston Parish on this disaster, 
and that's strictly due to the inability of FEMA to work as a 
team. And I'm going to go back and throw something else in. If 
you'll look at your National Response Framework, if you look at 
your NIMS management system, it all says that we work as a team 
at the lowest possible level. It's not a team approach when it 
comes to FEMA. So, yes, give me a block grant; let me handle my 
people.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;You know, that's what's sad about this,
is there are a lot of good men and women serving in all of the 
organizations. You go talk to the person who is down there on 
the ground in Louisiana, trying to do things, working for FEMA; 
I think their hearts are in the right place.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;But I don't think any of you could look at this and assess 
it as a B-plus, or highly successful, anything other than a 
total and utter failure from top to bottom.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We're not serving the people that--they pay the taxes. They 
do what they're supposed to do, and they're on the receiving 
end of something that is so devastating, it is--you can't even 
fathom. I don't understand and nor should we ever tolerate such 
a lack of response.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I want to read--this is, again, it's an internal FEMA 
document. This document--and the print is like 2 font here. But 
this is January 2017. This is regarding CB&amp;amp;I. It says: ``For 
the month of December 2016, the report indicates that the 
contractor received 1,980 maintenance calls. The contractor 
only completed 198 of those. Thus, 90 percent were not 
complete.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;And, Mr. Boone, you come here and tell us you were highly 
successful. I just don't understand the disconnect. It's not 
even close.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Let me read another. This is the long term. That was just 
for the short term. Long term: ``Repeat caller complaints that 
go without maintenance attention are numerous.'' Then it says 
there are 1,655 out of 4,793 issues not completed, which is 
only a completion rate of 35 percent. It's not as if we haven't 
ponied up the money. You're getting big contracts, but I don't 
understand, Mr. Boone, how you're not aware of this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    And, Mr. Fenton, if you're not aware of this, who is?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Upon coming into this job January 20, I went
down there, and I asked those questions. At that time when I 
was down there in February----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; When did you--how long have you been
with FEMA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I have been with FEMA 20 year, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; What was your job before this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I was the Regional Administrator for the West
Coast and still am.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; And still you don't have--because you
are acting?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I'm the Acting Administrator right now, but----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Sorry. Keep going. Keep going.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; So I'm the--I've been with FEMA 20 years: 13
years in Region IX; 6 years in D.C.; went back there for the 
last 2 years as now the Regional Administrator. I got sent here 
to be the Acting Administrator starting January 20. I've been 
here since January 20 as Acting Administrator, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I tell you: You've got your hands full
because we've seen this movie before, and we've seen it in 
Louisiana, and we've failed again. The Federal Government fell 
on its face, and the State didn't do much to help either. As 
I'm telling you, to not be prepared in April for a contract to 
start putting stuff out the door, I just can't even imagine 
what these people are dealing with in terms--let's go to 
Congressman Johnson. He's also joining us from Louisiana.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    Congressman, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;It really was an epic failure, Federal and State 
government.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I take issue with what you said, Mr. Harrell. I don't think 
it was your failure. I think it was at higher levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;And, you know, the sad thing about it is, in Louisiana, we 
do recovery really well because we have so much experience with 
it. I mean, sadly, as you know, just in your administration, 
Governor, there's been a series of tragedies and disasters, but 
the reason we do recovery well in Louisiana is not because of 
the Federal or State government; it's because of our people, 
because they are very resourceful. They're survivors. 
Communities work together. Neighbors ban together. Citizens go 
into action. They know what to do. They take care of one 
another, often in spite of the government, not because of it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Governor, in January, you described the Shelter at Home 
Program as being very successful. And there's been a lot of 
discussion about this today, and you gentlemen have taken some 
heat.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Is it--do you still stand by that statement? Do you still 
say that our Shelter at Home is a model that's very successful?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Governor Edwards. I believe that it served its purpose by 
and large, and it's successful in the sense that in--I think it 
was a little over 3 months, the Shelter at Home Program was 
stood up, and, actually, 10,000 homes in just a little over 3 
months actually received those repairs to make their homes 
safe, habitable, and secure so people can go back home. That 
was the only option we had then. It's--and, by the way, if a 
similar disaster hits us today, it's the only option we have 
today because you don't have the TSA available in terms of 
motels and hotels. The rental assistance isn't available 
because you don't have the units there, the capacity. And MHUs 
are too slow coming and actually cost too much. But if you look 
at the fact that 3,000 families were in hotels, we paid $46 
million for that, and we did--actually, got 11,000 homes done 
under Shelter at Home. And the most important thing was those 
individuals were able to stay in their communities where they 
live and work so that businesses had employees and customers; 
schools had students and teachers; churches had parishioners on 
Sunday.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    And so, given the concerns that we have, I would say that 
it was largely successful. Certainly not perfect. We would much 
rather have engaged in much better repairs in terms of not 
being limited to temporary repairs, for example.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Well, and part of the purpose of this exercise
is so that we can all learn by the mistakes and make 
improvements so, Heaven forbid, something of this scale happens 
again, we can do it better.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;So, you know, I'm not--I don't know that everybody agrees 
with the assessment, Governor, and I'm basing this in part on 
this past December, you know, the State surveyed over 2,000 
people that were involved, about a fifth of the homeowners that 
were using the Shelter at Home Program. And The Advocate had a 
report that said 46 percent of them, almost half, said they 
would not return home at that point, and they were citing 
shoddy repairs and questionable living conditions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;So, I mean, I know that there's been some improvements 
since that time, but, still, I think we've got a real 
perception problem, and I'm not sure how to overcome that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;There's also numerous reports of infamous overbilling for 
services and products and even charges for work that was never 
done. I know all of you are aware of that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;My question is--and my real concern always--is about good 
stewardship of taxpayer dollars and wise use of that and 
eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse. So, apparently, there's a 
lot of fraud involved in this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;What happens if the State receives a complaint about fraud 
of that magnitude, you know, for example, billing for charges 
that were never provided, services?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Governor Edwards. Well, at that point in time, if the State 
receives that information, we would call in AECOM, find out the 
specific contractor that engaged in the repairs on that 
particular home, a look at the scope of work that was 
authorized, the scope of work that was done, and the 
inspection, the final inspection, to see if it matched up and 
if the work was truly performed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;How many outstanding cases of fraud against
the Shelter at Home Program are being investigated now? Do you 
know?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Governor Edwards. As far as we know, there are no 
outstanding allegations of fraud against the--the client--the 
program. And I think the total number of complaints was in the 
neighborhood of 300 out of 11,000. And those complaints weren't 
about fraud, necessarily. Those were individuals who wanted a 
scope of work that was greater than what was performed. Some of 
it had to do with the workmanship, and a lot of times those 
were conflated because people don't like the temporary nature 
of the repairs that were made in many cases.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I'm out of time, but just one last question
for FEMA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Mr. Fenton, does FEMA provide direct oversight of the 
Shelter at Home Program or the State equivalence thereof? I 
mean, how does that--what does that look like in terms of 
oversight?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;It's a grant through the State. We've worked
with them on the implementation plan and the checks and 
balances within that. They talked to New York, got their 
lessons learned from New York. We've looked at some past IG 
audits on some of their recommendations, and the program is 
running again as a pilot for the second time in Louisiana.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;    We provide a grant through our public assistance program. 
So, eventually, there will be a project worksheet for this 
through cost sharing, and we provided oversight of those 
dollars going down to the State and ensure that they're doing 
the work.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; This is the last question, and I'm just going
to ask you, for the record today--I'm sure this goes without 
saying--but we have your absolute commitment that you're going 
to improve these programs and make this better for the next 
round, right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;Well, definitely, 110 percent, sir. I've
already started, since coming on in January 20, the housing. 
Some of that I talked about in my opening statement. I've 
reached out to MIT and Lincoln Labs to get them, the academic 
community, to take a look at what we're doing and give us, 
maybe, an outside look at what we could do better. And we're 
going to do a--we're going to invite industry in for Industry 
Day because there's a much--there's multiple different 
capabilities we could bring to the table. If we could find 
something that's more agile, faster, but as safe, we will look 
to do that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;Right now, the MHU, just because of the size, trying to put 
it on individual lots represents a lot of challenges with 
degraded infrastructure. And so it slows us down in being able 
to meet the numbers that happen in this event.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;    So we need to go back to something that is more agile but 
still safe. When we were in Katrina, we were using travel 
trailers. And while they were more agile and faster, the safety 
was a concern. So we need to find something in the middle that 
meets the requirement during these big events, and we're 
looking to make those improvements.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt; Let's do it quickly. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt;[Presiding.] Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt;    We'll go to the ranking minority member, Congressman 
Cummings.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Mr. Fenton, after Mr. Wilson's death, FEMA raised serious 
concerns that CB&amp;amp;I was understaffed and disorganized. Senior 
FEMA staff warned that CB&amp;amp;I failed to complete 90 percent of 
its maintenance calls in the month of December. The contractor 
failed to show up for 40 percent of the scheduled monthly 
maintenance visits. FEMA characterized CB&amp;amp;I's performance 
during this period as, quote, ``error prone and incomplete,'' 
end of quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Sir, can you please describe the concerns that FEMA had 
with CB&amp;amp;I?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;Sir, since coming on January 20t and in my
meeting in February down at the joint field office, I asked a 
number of questions because of concerns I've heard with regard 
to the contract. There was a number of discussions that go on 
in operations between individuals with regard to concerns, 
emails that you guys have. Ultimately, it warranted a letter of 
concern that we wrote to CB&amp;amp;I from our contractor to put in 
writing those issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;    Since that letter of concern, I'm told, when I went down to 
visit, that they have stepped up and that times have 
significantly decreased. And last night, when I had discussion 
with our contractor again and asked the questions, they were 
pretty--they were--said that the relationship and the level of 
work have increased the level, and everything is satisfactory 
at this point.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;So, Mr. Boone, how do you respond to the
problems, the failures of your company? There were some 
failures. Wouldn't you agree?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. Those----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;The whole--okay. Go ahead.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Admiral Boone. Those issues that have been raised are new 
to me. So, obviously, I need to sort through that and 
understand the context of those issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    If there are failures, we'll fix them. I think, as Mr. 
Fenton has articulated, there was a letter of concern never 
officially given to us. So it was slid across the table from 
the contracting officer and shared in a brief moment with our 
project manager. We aggressively addressed those concerns and 
have performed, to our knowledge, in a very highly successful 
way.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;All right. Well, let me just cite this very
quickly, and then we'll be ending the hearing very shortly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;On January 17, 2017, one of the residents in a manufactured 
housing unit wrote to FEMA about a serious plumbing issue that 
she had been trying to get resolved for a month. When she 
called CB&amp;amp;I's maintenance line, she found that, and I quote, 
``it basically is a help line--a help desk ticket center with 
no calls back,'' end of quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;She was so frustrated with CB&amp;amp;I's lack of response that her 
husband rented a drain camera to prove that the sewer pipe had 
burst and sent the pictures of the damaged pipe to CB&amp;amp;I. After 
several more days of waiting, CB&amp;amp;I finally dispatched a 
contractor to the unit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;She explained that the subcontractor, and I quote, 
``assessed it, looked at our video, wrote up the paperwork,'' 
end quote, but then the technician left without fixing the 
problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;Mr. Boone, why didn't your company fix the problem? Is that 
unusual?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Admiral Boone. No. We address those problems. So, again, 
this is news to me, and I'll dig into it. But we have a 
reputation of doing prompt and responsive work. So, obviously, 
if this allegation is true, we have to get to the bottom of it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt;    Thank you very much.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; [Presiding.] I recognize the gentleman
from Wisconsin, Mr. Grothman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt;Yeah, Mr. Fenton, I'm going to kind of go
over some territory that was covered before. I had another 
hearing at the time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt;    Each manufactured housing unit that you purchased cost 
around $140 grand to install and maintain, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; The full wraparound cost to put a manufactured
housing unit on an individual's property is $129 is what I'm 
told, $149 if we have to put it on a different lot. That 
includes the purchase of the unit, the hauling to the location, 
the installation cost, and then eventually the deactivation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; And some people would buy these on their own?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Some people may buy them on their own. We, in
FEMA, buy them direct from six manufacturers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; Okay. So you got a good deal, well, as you
could buy them in bulk?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; We're buying units that are from HUD regulated
plants. We're buying units that have extra retrofitting as far 
as the frame. We put a fire suppression system in them and do a 
lot of things above and beyond the normal models.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; Right. Right. Right. But, presumably, because
you're buying lots rather than if I just walked up and say I 
wanted one, you're getting a better deal than somebody would 
wind up if they just bought one of these, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; I would think so. I think time plays into that.
You know, we're buying a lot of units in a very short duration, 
and--and--so we're--but there's time and then there's the 
number that we're buying.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; Okay. My notes here say that you turn around,
and after spending $140, $145 grand for these, you turn around 
and sell for them $11 grand. Is that accurate?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; We are required to, if they--if it's not cost
effective to bring them back to our location, they can't be 
retrofitted, then we go through the GSA excess property. By 
statute, we're required to put it through there, and they sell 
those units. And $11,000 is what I'm told that some of those 
units fetch.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; Does that hit you as unusual?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; As far as?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; Odd? I mean, I would think that if you buy
something for $140 grand or $130 grand and, you know, 2 years 
later you sell it for $11 grand, I would think that somebody 
really screwed up. Do you have----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Well, the unit itself is $60,000 and, then it's
been used now for some period of time. So you have to make 
repairs to the unit, which is some sort of--which is some cost, 
and then you've got to go ahead and move the unit back and 
store it. So we take into account the cost to restore it back 
to predisaster condition, the cost to move it, the cost to go 
ahead and mothball it and sustain it versus the cost to sell it 
onsite. And if it's more cost effective to sell it onsite, 
we're going to choose that option versus exceeding that cost by 
doing all the--three things that I said and doing more cost to 
go ahead and move it back to a location, especially if it's not 
usable again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; Okay.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; And many of these are not usable after 18
months and after the travel that they've done already.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; You paid $140,000 a year for something that's
not usable after 16 months?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; $60,000 for the unit. The rest of the cost is
moving it. The rest of the cost is installation of that, the 
water, sewer, gas hookups, and deactivation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; Even $60,000. You mean, a year and a half
after you buy something for $60,000, it has been so ripped 
apart that it's worth $10,000? And recently, staff here found 
one listed on your auction site--or GSA's auction site--for 
$2,500 bucks. Doesn't that--can you explain why the dramatic 
decline in value for something that I would think should be 
good for 30 or 40 years?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; All I know is that usually the long distances
they travel impact the frame of the unit. The use of it 
underneath the conditions that we put them in impact that. And 
so, therefore, we put them out on the fair market to get as 
much as GSA can get for those units.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; How many--usually one family lives in these
things?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes, one family usually.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; Well, I'll tell you this: If I was in this
situation like this and I needed housing for 2 years or 
something, I would think if you'd--you rent an apartment 
almost, I would think--you know, maybe not in Washington, D.C., 
obviously, but other places, you can get a fairly good 
apartment for under $10,000 a year. Wouldn't it be more cost 
effective if somebody is in a situation, say, for year and a 
half, we are just giving you a check for $12,000, and you find 
housing?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; We do provide rental assistance to them at the
fair market rental rate.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; I mean across the board. Rather than say, I'm
going to spend $150 grand for something I'm going to sell in a 
year and a half for $10 grand--about, maybe $140 and $12, or 
whatever--why don't we just across the board just say, ``Here, 
family, here's a check for $15,000; you find an apartment''?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;I think we should look at many options to do
that. The case, though, is that if you want the individual to 
stay within that community, and you want to re-establish that 
community, if there's no resources available in that community 
because we are providing rental assistance, we are providing 
hotel assistance, and the reason why we're going to 
manufactured homes is because there are--those other two 
options are either not available or the individual wants to be 
back to their home to make repairs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt;    So giving some of the grant is an option. We're glad to 
look at that and discuss that as an option, but I'm not sure it 
takes care of the issue.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Grothman&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Mr. Grothman"&gt; Well, my time is up. I'm just saying, you
know, wherever I am today, I find people that are driving the 
half hour or 50 minutes to work. But thanks.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; I recognize Mr. Graves for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;I just want to follow up on a few things.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;One, Mr. Fenton, I--look, you inherited this mess. I know 
that you've been out West and that you came in and, certainly, 
there's been a lot of frustration aimed at you. But I know that 
you weren't responsible for these decisions, and I just wanted 
to make that clear. I know that you came in an acting role 
after this, and a lot of the frustrations we had during the 
peak of the flood were not your responsibility. Unfortunately, 
the committee did invite Mr. Fugate to come testify at the last 
hearing, and he did not come, and I just wanted to distinguish 
that fact.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;But one thing I want to reiterate, you cannot allow for 
this type--these types of failures to continue in future 
disasters, in this one and in future disasters. We are 
revictimizing disaster victims; it's not okay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Number two, we're fleecing taxpayers. The cost of these 
trailers, whenever local trailers dealers--Mr. Fenton, one 
thing I wanted to point out, Jason Ard, the Livingston Parish 
sheriff, came to us and said, for $35,000, if I remember 
correctly, per trailer, they can set up a trailer park for his 
deputies, because they needed stability; he needed law 
enforcement. I called the Secretary. I called the Deputy 
Secretary. I tried Mr. Fugate several times; never heard back 
from him. Had conference calls with a deputy and with the 
Secretary about this, and repeatedly, they rejected it. In 
turn, they instead paid $150 grand per trailer. Right now 
Sheriff Yarborough I think is selling back some of those 
trailers. Again, my number is ballpark, about $25,000 or a net 
payment from FEMA or for the sheriff's office for $10,000. 
Y'all are refusing to reimburse him. So you're opting to spend 
$150,000 instead of $10,000. How do you go stand up in front of 
taxpayers with a $20 trillion debt and defend those decisions?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;Governor, I want to clarify or just make a statement on 
Shelter at Home. I commend you for Shelter at Home. I tweeted 
that day and said that that is an innovative approach, and I 
like it because it helps get people back into their homes, 
their communities, helps restore the tax base. And I know, Mr. 
Harrell, President Layton Ricks, and I know we have we also 
have the chairman of our Homeland Security Committee in the 
senate, Bodi White, and the chairman of the Education 
Committee, Senator Blade Morrish, and Representative Miguez 
here. I know all these people care about people getting back 
and restoring the community and the tax base and everything 
back in their homes. I commend you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;But I also said the execution, it was going to be based on 
execution. I think execution was a failure. You and I have 
talked about the word ``temporary'' in the Stafford Act. We've 
got to work with FEMA to change that. Because I think--once I 
saw the parameters, it was absurd, and it just didn't make 
sense. So--to move forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;And what happened is we preempted, we prevented these flood 
victims by having other housing options by doing Shelter at 
Home in many cases. And that's unfortunate. People told me over 
and over again, they couldn't get responses from contractors; 
the work was substandard; and had they known what it would have 
been like, they never would have opted for that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    Lastly, I've got a number of documents. I'm not going to go 
back and forth with you here on arguing what the timelines are 
and everything else. So what I'm going to do, is, Mr. Chairman, 
I've got documents from HUD. I've got documents from the 
Governor. I've got the Federal Register notice. I'm going 
submit these for the record. The documents speak for 
themselves, very clear in this case. And I ask unanimous 
consent that those be included in the record.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Without objection, so ordered.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Graves&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;And at the end of the day--and it doesn't
matter, you know, again, Mr. Harrell, Mr. Boone, Mr. Fenton, 
Governor--this whole thing is about people. It's about people. 
And the decisions that you have to make at the end of the day, 
you need to be thinking about those where you can stand up in 
front of people and defend the decisions that are being made. 
And what ends up happening is that the line of decisions are 
absolutely decisions that can't be defended.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;I think about it all the time: I've got to defend this at a 
townhall meeting, standing up at a townhall meeting and 
defending it to constituents. And a lot of these decisions 
simply can't be defended, whether it's the amount of time it's 
taken from a September appropriation that's not going to get 
out the door until probably May, or it's trailers that have 
taken 6 months to get to people after this flood, or it's the 
fleecing of taxpayers. It's absolutely unacceptable, and you 
can't defend these actions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;And so people can say that this manual, this regulation, 
whatever, those things--in the wake of a disaster, in the peak 
of a disaster, you've got to do what's right. And over and over 
again, I remember being in disasters, being in Unified Command 
in the State of Louisiana, in some cases, you've got to say, 
``I'm going to do what's right versus what this manual says,'' 
because no two disasters are the same; manuals in some cases 
and regulations can't anticipate the unique conditions. And 
FEMA gets so wrapped around the actual--watching the 
inefficiencies there was infuriating, and, unfortunately, in 
many cases, they are continuing on, and these people are being 
revictimized.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;And so, for the tens and thousands people that are still 
displaced--tens of thousands that are still displaced today--we 
need to do a better job getting them back into their 
communities, and we need to make sure that none of this ever 
happens again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Mr. Graves"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I thank the gentleman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    I now recognize Mr. Cummings.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; I just want to submit a letter for the
record. Mr. Cartwright referred to this letter, dated February 
14, 2017, from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, the one complimenting the Governor. I wanted to--
--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Without objection, so ordered.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cummings&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="579" speaker="Mr. Cummings"&gt; That's all.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;As we close here, I want to thank you all for being here 
and participating.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;I think what Mr. Graves pointed out is a very good summary 
of the problem and the situation that we have. I really do 
commend the Livingston Parish sheriff, who took care of his 
deputies, you know.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;    And you've got to take a good hard look, Mr. Fenton, 
because here's the sheriff, whose got to take care of his 
deputies, because he knows if he takes care of his deputies, 
his deputies can help take care of other people. Somehow, some 
way, he went out and bought things at $35,000 apiece. And you, 
FEMA, are buying them at 150,000 and taking 6 months to do it. 
Something dramatically wrong there.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Fenton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Mr. Fenton"&gt; Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt; Mr. Harrell, I want to give you the last
word here. You live there. You deal with this. You put your 
heart and soul into this, I know. What are the closing 
comments, things you want all of us to hear? And then we'll 
close this hearing.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harrell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;Two words: FEMA reform. It's that simple. But
don't do it in Washington. Don't do it at the regional level. 
Get it down to the State. Get it down to the local level. Let 
us have input. We don't have it. We try to follow the guidance 
that FEMA puts out on every document they have. We do it; FEMA 
does not do it. That's all I'm asking: FEMA reform. It's that 
simple.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Mr. Harrell"&gt;    I'd like to play a part in it. I think a lot of our 
emergency managers across the country would like to play a part 
in it. That's my goal.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Chaffetz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;We hear you. Thank you. I appreciate you
doing that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="589" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;And for the men and women who suffered through that and 
responded and helped their neighbors, God bless you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="590" speaker="Chairman Chaffetz"&gt;Again, thank you for this hearing. It's been very 
productive. The committee stands adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;APPENDIX&lt;/option&gt;
