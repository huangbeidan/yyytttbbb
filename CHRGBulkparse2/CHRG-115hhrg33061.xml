Administration for today's Committee meeting. A quorum is 
present, so we may proceed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker=""&gt;The meeting record will remain open for 5 legislative days 
so that Members may submit any materials that they wish to be 
included therein.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker=""&gt;There is one item on our docket today, Committee Resolution 
115-19, a resolution to disburse $200,000 from the Committee's 
Reserve Fund to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. This 
disbursement is in response to a request the Committee received 
from the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on 
Veterans' Affairs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker=""&gt;The disbursement will provide resources for the Committee 
on Veterans' Affairs to establish a new Technology 
Modernization Subcommittee. This new subcommittee will focus 
its oversight efforts on the VA's $15.8 billion Electronic 
Health Record Modernization Program, by far the largest 
electronic health record transition ever attempted as well as 
one of the Federal Government's biggest IT projects.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker=""&gt;    I would now like to recognize my colleague and the 
Committee's Ranking Member, Mr. Brady, for the purpose of 
providing an opening statement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Brady&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;Mr. Chairman, I support the funding request for the 
Veterans' Committee. And I have received assurances from the 
Ranking Member that he will have access to one-third of the 
funds, consistent with their tradition of how money is spent on 
a committee--for a committee is handled.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;With that assurance, I support the request and urge my 
colleagues to do the same.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Brady"&gt;    And I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;The Chairman. The gentleman yields back&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"/&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;Does any other Member wish to be recognized for the purpose 
of an opening statement?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;I now call up and lay before the Committee Committee 
Resolution 115-19. Without objection, the first reading is 
dispensed with, and the resolution is considered read and open 
for amendment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;[The information follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;    [[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;    The Chairman. Would any Member like to make a statement or &lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;[[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
offer an amendment?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;Seeing none, I move the Committee adopt Committee 
Resolution 115-19.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;The question is on the motion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;All those in favor, signify by saying aye.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;All those opposed, signify by saying nay.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the 
motion is agreed to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon 
the table.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;Does any Member wish to submit supplemental or minority 
views?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;Seeing none, for all the matters considered here today, I 
would ask unanimous consent that the staff be authorized to 
make technical and conforming changes if necessary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;Without objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"&gt;That concludes today's markup. Without objection, the 
markup is adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
