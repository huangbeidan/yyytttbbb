    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2 p.m., in 
room 2128 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Stevan Pearce 
[chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.
    Members present: Representatives Pearce, Pittenger, 
Rothfus, Tipton, Hill, Emmer, Zeldin, Davidson, Budd, 
Perlmutter, Maloney, Himes, Foster, Kildee, Vargas, Gottheimer, 
and Kihuen.
    Chairman Pearce. The subcommittee will come to order.
    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a 
recess of the subcommittee at any time.
    Members of the full committee who are not members of the 
&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance may participate&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;in today's hearing, and all members will have 5 legislative 
days within which to submit extraneous materials to the Chair 
for inclusion in the record.
    This hearing is entitled, ``Exploring the Financial Nexus 
of Terrorism, Drug Trafficking, and Organized Crime.'' I now 
recognize myself for 2-1/2 minutes to give an opening 
statement.
    I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Today's 
hearing will examine the nexus of terrorism, drug trafficking, 
and organized crime to better understand how powerful criminal 
organizations exploit the U.S. financial system for their 
illicit gain.
    Transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs, operate on a 
global scale, crossing international boundaries to further 
their pursuit of power, influence, and profits.
    The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that 
TCOs generate a total of $870 billion in revenue annually.
    This is done through accessing global supply chains across 
the land, sea, air, and cyber domains to move goods, people, 
services, money, and data.
    The massive profits also ensure that these criminal groups 
are powerful enough to influence the political, judicial, and 
law enforcement branches of the more vulnerable countries, 
providing them the protection to continue their illegal schemes 
and further expand their influence.
    Terror groups and criminal organizations as well continue 
to merge as terrorists increasingly turn to transnational 
criminals to gain logistical and financial support for their 
activities.
    This is startling simply because it allows previously 
localized fanatics a platform to spread their radical 
propaganda on an international scale.
    We must remain vigilant in our ongoing efforts to dissuade 
these groups, and in that vein I want to thank Mr. Kustoff for 
his bill, the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of 
Transnational Criminal Organizations Act.
    This legislation would require the development of a 
national strategy to combat TCOs and their financial support 
networks.
    It passed out of the House earlier this month and I hope 
with continued support that it will be signed into law. Today's 
hearing is an opportunity to dissect the connection of the 
transnational crime, terrorism, and corruption.
    I hope our members will take this opportunity to learn from 
our witnesses how organized crime and terrorist groups fund 
their operations as well as pose a significant risk to our 
national security through their illicit schemes.
    I would appreciate any comments from our witnesses on the 
biggest risk TCOs are posing to our country and how Congress 
can assist law enforcement in disrupting their operations.
    Again, I would like to thank our witnesses for being here 
today and look forward to their expert testimony on these very 
important issues.
    I would now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. 
Perlmutter, for 2-1/2 minutes.
    Mr. Perlmutter. I thank the Chair, and I want to thank him 
and the committee. We have had some interesting hearings on 
subjects similar to this as well as some briefings and I want 
to thank the panel for coming and visiting with us today.
    According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 
trafficking in illegal drugs is the largest source of revenue 
for transnational organized crime groups accounting for 
approximately half of all revenue generated by the groups.
    This means traffickers and cartels are profiting while 
Americans suffer the consequences of illegal drug use. The 
opioid epidemic stretches from coast to coast and devastates 
the lives of individuals and families every day.
    In 2016, there were over 42,000 related deaths in the 
United States and in Colorado where I am from, 942 people died 
from opioid overdoses.
    We have also seen the devastation of other drugs in our 
communities like heroin, methamphetamine, fentanyl, and many, 
many more.
    As we address this public health crisis here at home, we 
must simultaneously be working to shut down the organizations 
and illicit trade activities responsible for the availability 
of these drugs.
    We need to make sure law enforcement has the tools they 
need to shine light on these activities and work with our 
international partners to stop the flow of drugs and cash into 
the country.
    Recently, criminals have incorporated new technologies such 
as crypto currencies, drones, and other methods in their drug 
trafficking efforts to evade detection, which creates complex 
challenges for law enforcement, and I look forward to the 
testimony we will hear from you today to help us answer some of 
these difficult questions.
    And with that, I yield back to the Chair.
    Chairman Pearce. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, 
Mr. Pittenger, for 2-1/2 minutes.
    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member 
Perlmutter, for holding the hearing today.
    I'd also like to thank our distinguished panelists for 
lending their expertise to our subcommittee this afternoon.
    The nexus between terrorist organizations and criminal 
enterprises poses a grave threat to U.S. national security. We 
know Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations are actively 
partnering with Latin American drug cartels in order to raise 
money to finance their terrorist activities around the globe.
    The tri-border region of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay in 
particular are a key focal point for drug trafficking, money 
laundering, and other cross-border criminal endeavors.
    To that end, the Western Hemisphere must be seen as a front 
line in the fight against terror. While this is often an under-
the-radar issue, it is critical that Congress better understand 
the dynamics of this threat and the methods by which terrorists 
and criminal organizations operate within this region.
    I visited South America numerous times and have hosted two 
parliamentary intelligence security forums in Buenos Aires, 
Argentina.
    The forums had brought together over 200 participants from 
15 countries across Latin America with a collaborative 
discussion on efforts to address terrorism financing, 
cybersecurity, intelligence, and other relevant issues.
    What I have found is very willing interested parties with 
those who are very much lacking on our technology capabilities 
as well as an infrastructure for judicial reform.
    Whether it's through international organizations, bilateral 
partnerships, or other efforts within our Government and 
private sector, we need to carefully and thoroughly examine 
this threat and determine what additional tools and resources 
are needed to target and cut off this plentiful source of 
financing for terrorist organizations.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my 
time.
    Chairman Pearce. The gentleman yields back.
    Today, we welcome the testimony of our four witnesses.
    Ms. Celina Realuyo has been Professor of Practice at the 
William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies at the 
National Defense University since 2007.
    Professor Realuyo has over 2 decades of international 
experience in the public, private, and academic sectors. From 
2002 to 2006, Professor Realuyo served as the State Department 
Director of Counterterrorism Finance Programs. She also Co-
chaired the U.S. Interagency Terrorist Financing Working Group.
    Previously, Ms. Realuyo was a private banker in London with 
Goldman Sachs, International. She also had a distinguished 
career as a U.S. Foreign Service officer.
    Professor Realuyo holds an MBA from Harvard Business 
School, an MA from Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced 
International Studies, and a BS from Georgetown University 
School of Foreign Affairs.
    Mr. Derek Maltz is currently the Executive Director of 
Governmental Relations at Pen-Link, Limited. Mr. Maltz 
previously served as Senior Executive in the Federal law 
enforcement as the Director of the Special Operations Division 
(SOD) of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the U.S. 
Department of Justice (DOJ).
    Mr. Maltz was instrumental in expanding SOD and the DOJ's 
Transnational Organized Crime Operational Center. He formally 
established the Counter Narco-terrorism Operations Center 
within SOD with a focus on global money laundering and terror 
financing.
    Most notably, as head of DEA's special operations, Mr. 
Maltz oversaw Project Cassandra, a DEA-led effort launched in 
2008 to undercut Hezbollah funding from illicit drug sources 
for 9 years, ending in July 2014.
    This Special Operations Division successfully coordinated 
several significant operations against drug cartels, including 
the capture of Chapo Guzman in Mexico and initiated a multi-
agency money laundering project resulting in the identification 
of a Lebanese-Canadian bank as a facilitator involved with an 
international trade-based money laundering scheme supported by 
Hezbollah.
    Mr. Maltz holds a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting 
from Syracuse University.
    Mr. Humire is the Executive Director of the Center for a 
Secure Free Society where he specializes in transnational 
threats in the Western Hemisphere.
    Prior to this, Mr. Humire served in the U.S. Marine Corps 
with combat tours in Iraq and a multinational training 
exercise, UNITAS, in Latin America and the Caribbean.
    After leaving the military, Mr. Humira attended George 
Mason University where he studied global affairs and economics 
and began building the Center for a Secure Free Society's 
global network of more than 100 security scholars in close to 
30 countries as the Director of Institute Relations at the 
Atlas Economic Research Foundation.
    Mr. Humire's first book is entitled, ``Iran's Strategic 
Penetration of Latin America.'' More recently, he published a 
monograph titled, ``After Nisman: How the Death of a Prosecutor 
Revealed Iran's Growing Influence in the Americas.''
    Dr. Louise Shelley is the Omer L. and Nancy Hirst Endowed 
Chair and a university Professor at George Mason University. 
She is at the Schar School of Policy and Government and directs 
the Terrorism, Transnational Crime, and Corruption Center, or 
TraCCC, that she founded.
    Dr. Shelley is the leading expert on the relationship among 
terrorism, organized crime, and corruption as well as human 
trafficking, transnational crime, and terrorism. Some of her 
recent books include, ``Dirty Entanglements: Corruption, Crime, 
and Terrorism'' and ``Human Trafficking: A Global 
Perspective.''
    From 1995 to 2014, Dr. Shelley ran programs in Russia, 
Ukraine, and Georgia--the leading specialist on the problems of 
organized crime and corruption.
    Dr. Shelley received an undergraduate degree cum laude from 
Cornell University in penology and Russian literature. She 
holds an MA in criminology from the University of Pennsylvania.
    She also studied at the Law Faculty of Moscow State 
University on IREX and Fulbright Fellowships and holds a Ph.D. 
in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania.
    Each of you is going to be recognized for 5 minutes to give 
an oral presentation of your testimony. Without objection, each 
of your written statements will be made part of the record.
    Mr. Humire, you're recognized for 5 minutes.

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MR. JOSEPH HUMIRE&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Humire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Thank you, Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Chairman Pearce, Vice Chairman Pittenger, Ranking Member 
Perlmutter, Congressman Rothfus, and distinguished members of 
the subcommittee, good afternoon and thank you for your 
leadership and for inviting me here before you today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;I'd like to begin by repeating an old refrain often heard 
in the military, which is amateurs talk strategy but 
professionals talk logistics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;What this means is that if you want to tackle the heart of 
the threat networks, you have to attack the logistics. 
Essentially, you have to go after the financial flows.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;The hearing today and all the work of the subcommittee is 
instrumental in emphasizing this point. After all, it's the 
illicit financial networks that are sustaining a convergence of 
threats to the United States and our allies abroad.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Not too long ago, conventional wisdom held that criminals 
and terrorists do not cooperate on a large scale because they 
have different goals and motivations. One is motivated by greed 
and the other by God.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Today, after overwhelming empirical evidence, we know 
that's not true. The crime-terror convergence is real, it's 
growing, and it poses a significant threat to U.S. national 
security.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Let me offer one statistic to reinforce this point. A 2014 
report by the Combating Terrorism Center showed that in a 
sample of 2,700 known criminals and terrorists in more than 122 
countries, 98 percent--let me repeat that--98 percent are 
connected through an all-channel network.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;This is very powerful evidence of the crime-terror 
convergence. But when we talk about the convergence, there is 
no other organization on our foreign terrorist organization 
list that embodies the nexus of terrorism and transnational 
organized crime than Lebanese Hezbollah.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;A bombshell article from Politico published last year 
renewed a policy debate on possibly designating Hezbollah as a 
transnational criminal organization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;I fully support this designation and would like to 
emphasize at least two important benefits it could bring. 
First, it delegitimizes Hezbollah in the hearts and minds of 
many Lebanese expats and the broader Shi'a community worldwide 
who see Hezbollah as a resistance movement with clear 
principles and ideology.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;By labeling Hezbollah a transnational criminal 
organization, we damage their reputation, which in turn hinders 
their ability to recruit members or raise funds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Number two, the second benefit is even more significant 
because a transnational criminal organization designation of 
Hezbollah shines a light on its criminal activity that could 
prompt our global partners to place Hezbollah under greater 
scrutiny in their own countries.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;This is the key to making our sanctions effective. If we 
are to leverage our sanctions against Hezbollah and maximize 
our effectiveness then we have to encourage our global partners 
to investigate and prosecute Hezbollah in their own countries 
using their own legal frameworks and their own designation 
list.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;The question of legal frameworks is vitally important in 
Latin America where Hezbollah has built a growing crime terror 
empire.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Many of our partners in this region do not have proper 
legal frameworks to combat Islamic terrorism and none have 
recognized Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;In my written testimony, I highlight one prominent 
counterterrorism case of an alleged Hezbollah operative in 
Peru.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;The reason I highlight this case is because it represents 
the glaring antiterrorism legal vacuum that Hezbollah has taken 
advantage of for decades in Latin America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;In this particular case in Peru, had the accused Lebanese 
national confessed to being a member of the Shining Path, an 
old Marxist-Leninist domestic terror group, he would probably 
be sentenced to 25 years in prison.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;But because he confessed for working for Hezbollah, he was 
almost set free. This is exactly the kind of counterterrorism 
miscommunication that leads to future terrorist attacks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Designating Hezbollah as a TCO will encourage our regional 
partners in South America to place greater attention to the 
Lebanese terror group, to clamp down on its ever-growing 
business structure, particularly in the tri-border area, or&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;The TBA is a historic crime terror hub in the southern part 
of South America where Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil meet.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;In this area, OFAC has sanctioned 11 individual members or 
facilitators of Hezbollah dating back to 2004. As part of an 
upcoming SFS report, my researchers have identified at least 18 
new companies opened by these same sanctioned individual 
Hezbollah members in recent years, irrespective of our 
sanctions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Local authorities have not stopped these sanctioned 
individuals from operating in their country, even though it's 
widely known they work for or on behalf of Hezbollah.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;This underscores my central point, that whatever we do 
unilaterally here in the United States will be insufficient 
unless we can help our partners and allies in Latin America or 
elsewhere establish proper legal authorities and frameworks to 
deal with the crime terror convergence.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;If not, then our financial authorities and sanctions are 
destined to a truncated strategy of whack-a-mole, constantly 
chasing front companies and cutouts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;In closing, designating Hezbollah as a transnational 
criminal organization and helping the Latin American partners 
improve their anti-terrorism legal frameworks will end amateur 
hour and position the U.S. to lead the fight on dismantling the 
logistical networks of the crime terror convergence.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;Thank you, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MR. DEREK MALTZ&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MR. DEREK MALTZ"&gt;    Mr. Maltz, now you're recognized for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Chairman Pearce and distinguished members of the
committee, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to 
speak on these very important topics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;I was fortunate to be the agent in charge of DEA's Special 
Operations Division for almost 10 years before I retired, 
working with personnel from 30 agencies--law enforcement, 
intelligence community, Department of Defense.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;We had a daily battle trying to synchronize the efforts 
between the numerous agencies, especially as we lost 
capabilities to infiltrate the communications of the bad guys 
through encryption and advanced technology.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;I have always been a huge advocate of working in one unity 
of effort. Unfortunately, most of the time, when criminal cases 
connect through terror investigations, we lose cooperation 
right here in our back yards.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;They don't always follow the money trail in these 
investigations to the terror groups because of the lack of 
cooperation. It's unacceptable 16 years after 9/11, with all 
the inspector general reviews and the information-sharing 
failures, that this continues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;The agencies need to cooperate and share. The leaders must 
be in the process of stopping this madness for all of us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;I lost my brother Michael, U.S. para rescue, in the war and 
I am very passionate about national security and public safety 
issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;It's nothing new. We need strong leadership here. We need--
on this topic of crime and terror, we've been talking about 
this for too many years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;We need some more action instead of Beltway meetings to 
debate who's right, who's wrong. We all know what the answer 
is. Terrorists are increasingly turning to crime and criminal 
networks for their funding. We all know that. This has been 
stated numerous times.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;The most public example is we speak about Project Cassandra 
and we see how Hezbollah is operating like a worldwide drug 
cartel, moving millions of dollars and tons of cocaine all over 
the world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;I am thankful for Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his 
bold leadership in recognizing the serious gaps in our efforts 
here in the U.S., and he formed the Hezbollah Financing Narco-
Terrorism Task Force headed by a great prosecutor from New 
York, John Cronan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Forming a task force is great. We need complete sharing, 
though. Proactive investigations, high-level indictments, 
extraditions, with powerful U.S. Treasury actions is going to 
really do a lot to help us go after this problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;I remain optimistic because Mr. Cronan came from the 
Southern District of New York. It was that district in 2010 
that broke down the walls of international terrorism and drug 
trafficking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;It's the only place--I think Eastern District of Virginia 
wound up doing it as well. We need to learn from that 
successful model. Break down the walls.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;This was bold leadership. I was recently testing--I was 
recently reading testimony on international terrorism and drug 
trafficking from a 1985 joint Senate hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;It was surprising but very--it wasn't very surprising but 
very disappointing that Honorable Strom Thurmond 33 years ago 
said terrorists need money to carry out their heinous 
activities and there is increasing evidence that these groups 
are involved with the illicit drug trade.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;He went on to say how the terrorists are able to use the 
drug trade in two ways. Drugs erode our health, morals, and 
economy when the proceeds are used to finance the terrorists' 
activities that are directed at this country and our citizens.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;That's 33 years ago. Fifteen years ago after 9/11, FBI 
Assistant Director Steven McCraw told the Senate Judiciary 
Committee how terrorism and crime are inextricably linked.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Terrorism and crime have no borders and labeled 
international drug trafficking and terrorism a dangerous mix.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;He also indicated that terrorist acts, crime, and foreign 
intelligence activities are no longer distinct activities but, 
rather, profound fluid enterprises that through their very 
existence have a reverberating impact on national security.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;I thank Mr. McCraw on his important words. But my question 
is why are we still talking about this. OK. This is ridiculous 
now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;The agencies are loaded with all these dedicated 
experienced people. They have tools. They have capabilities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Now we need them to come together. In response to September 
11th, the DEA, along with the FBI and the attorney general 
formed a special coordination unit at the Special Operations 
Division right here in Chantilly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;It's known as the CNTOC today. The leaders recognize the 
dangerous nexus between drug trafficking and terrorism so they 
knew they needed a unit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;However, as we approach the fifth anniversary of the Boston 
bombing, we realize that it failed once again because we are 
not cooperating.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;So what are we going to do? We can't investigate terrorism 
in a cocoon, especially going after sophisticated transnational 
groups like Hezbollah, al-Qaida, and these other groups.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;We must shut down funding streams from a variety of crimes. 
It's not just drug trafficking. You guys know. It's cyber 
crime. It's alien smuggling. It's diamond smuggling.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;All right. So there must be true team effort between law 
enforcement and the intelligence community. Hezbollah is one of 
the worst terrorist organizations in the world and Project 
Cassandra outlines some really disturbing trends--$200 million 
a month moving through a network where they're selling used 
cars right from our back yard in America, right in our 
districts--all your districts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Even though we identified this scheme, we actually seized 
$150 million. We forfeited $102 million but the problem was we 
just touched the surface because we couldn't get all the 
agencies together.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;So we've come a long way in information sharing but we need 
your help. We need the leadership's help in this country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;If the Government refuses to share with each other, they've 
got to be held accountable. If people are not sharing, they 
have to be held accountable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;The Special Operations Division is a good platform to get 
this interagency task force going. It's proven its reliability 
over the years. I would highly recommend some additional 
resources with the right expertise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;The worst thing we need in this country right now is 
another center. Forget it. Don't even think about it. Let's get 
what we have and make it work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;SOD should be working closely with the FBI's JTTF (Joint 
Terrorism Task Force). We should provide them the resources so 
we can carry out President Trump's Executive Order to go after 
transnational crime and violent crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;We don't need any more centers. But we also need financial 
institutions to be held accountable. There has to be zero 
tolerance in this country for terror financing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;I know I went a little bit long. I am very passionate about 
this. I could talk all day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;    So thank you very much.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Maltz.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF MS. CELINA REALUYO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MS. CELINA REALUYO"&gt;    Ms. Realuyo, you're recognized now for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Pearce, Vice Chairman
Pittenger, Ranking Member Perlmutter, and the distinguished 
members of the subcommittee for this opportunity to appear 
before you today to testify on U.S. efforts to counter 
convergence of terrorism and crime with the financial 
instrument of national power.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;We face threats from revisionist states, aspiring nuclear 
powers, global terrorism, transnational organized crime, and 
cyber instructions that have made national security more 
daunting than ever before.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;The complexity of these threats requires nimble, multi-
disciplinary, and international approaches. Over the past year, 
the Trump Administration has issued strategies and policies to 
address terrorism and transnational organized crime that 
threaten U.S. interests at home and abroad.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;They recognized financing as one of the most critical of 
enablers for terrorism, crime, and corruption, and includes 
specific financial and economic measures that seek to better 
detect, dismantle, and deter these illicit networks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;We see this dangerous crime convergence, which my 
colleagues have spoken about, where groups are sharing 
operating areas, intelligence tactics, and resources that 
threaten nation states.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;ISIS perhaps best exemplifies a criminalized state engaged 
in extortion, oil smuggling, human trafficking, and antiquities 
looting that has made it the richest terrorist group in the 
world and in history as of 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;ISIS has been largely defeated in Iraq and Syria by 
deliberately attacking its leadership and, moreover, its 
financing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;However, last week's arrest of a Cuban national in Colombia 
has actually seen--who's plotted a terrorist attack in the name 
of ISIS against American diplomats at a restaurant in Bogota, 
Colombia reminds us that this threat of ISIS-inspired 
operations remains around the world.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Besides ISIS, the best known cases of convergence involve 
the narco insurgencies in Afghanistan and Colombia that have 
lasted for decades.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;This past year, I am disappointed to say, that opium 
production in Afghanistan and coca production in Colombia have 
reached alarming record levels that affect the stability not 
just of the world but here in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;The Trump Administration has demonstrated a genuine 
commitment to get tough on crime and pursue illicit networks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;In February of last year, one of the first Executive Orders 
issued by the White House was one enforcing Federal law with 
respect to transnational criminal organizations and preventing 
international trafficking, which reinforces the 2011 CTOC 
strategy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;The new national security strategy includes the mission to 
defeat jihadist terrorists and dismantle transnational criminal 
organizations with all instruments of national power in order 
to promote our Nation's security and prosperity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;It underscores the use of financial measures such as 
following the money trail and sanctions to stem the flow of 
funding to terrorists, criminals, and rogue states.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;The Administration has aggressively sanctioned Iran, North 
Korea, Russia, and Venezuela in order to isolate these rogue 
states.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Perhaps the best example of the effectiveness of sanctions 
is the recent case of North Korea. Increased diplomatic 
pressure, credible threat of military action, and severe 
economic sanctions imposed by us and our partner allies have 
radically changed the behavior of North Korea.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Kim Jong-Un's unexpected invitation to meet with President 
Trump face to face and his pledge to suspend nuclear testing 
while allowing for U.S.-South Korea militaries exercises 
continue to plan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;It's an interesting way in which economic sanctions 
actually complement our efforts on the diplomatic and the 
military fronts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;We hope that stricter sanctions against the Venezuelan 
regime, led by President Maduro and his vice president, who 
have been sanctioned by the U.S., including yesterday's very 
timely Executive Order against their virtual currency called 
the petro will similarly change the behavior of Venezuela and 
bring back democracy to that country. It is quite critical to 
the security of this hemisphere.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Venezuelan officials are actively involved in international 
drug trafficking and money laundering and are known to 
collaborate with extra-regional actors like Iran and Hezbollah, 
incorporating them into their own criminal networks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;U.S. policymakers should continue applying sanctions 
against key Venezuelan officials whose criminal activities help 
sustain this authoritarian regime and perpetuate the 
humanitarian crisis that we are now seeing devolve.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;As I've advocated in the past before this committee, we 
should continue to, first, employ the financial instrument of 
national power more deliberately into every one of our U.S. 
strategies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Second, bolster domestic and international financial 
intelligence and information sharing in order to counter threat 
financing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Third, dedicate more human, financial, and technological 
resources to those responsible for pursuing terrorist financing 
and financial crimes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;I agree with Derek Maltz in that we have a proliferation of 
centers that actually just must be reinforced and collaborate 
in a more fulsome manner.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Fourth, better understand the actual drivers of the illicit 
economy. Anticipate how new financial innovations such as 
crypto currencies could be used by future terrorist financiers 
and money laundering.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;And last, we must call upon the private sector and the 
civic sectors to be a part of this fight against illicit 
financing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;And with that, I think that we've seen now how we can 
actually use economic sanctions in a way to complement many of 
our other much more kinetic and more aggressive approaches, 
whether it's against rogue states, criminal networks such as 
the Mexican cartels, or transnational terrorist groups 
including al-Qaida and its affiliates as well as ISIS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee members, for your 
time and attention.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;Thank you, Ms. Realuyo.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF DR. LOUISE SHELLEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;Dr. Shelley, you are recognized now for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;Dr. Shelley. Thank you. It's a great honor to address 
Chairman Pearce, Vice Chair Pittenger, Minority Committee 
Member Perlmutter, and the rest of the committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;My statement is a little different from my fellow panelists 
in that I am trying to provide a little bit more global 
perspective. I seek to balance the drugs that you mentioned in 
your opening remarks as 50 percent of the financing with the 
other 50 percent that we also need to be looking at. These 
sources are becoming of increasing importance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;In late 2014, the Security Council of the United Nations 
adopted Resolution 2195 that identified the crimes that support 
terrorism.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;Of these, they indicate that trafficking of arms, persons, 
drugs, artifacts, illicit trade in natural resources including 
gold and other precious metals and stones, minerals, wildlife, 
charcoal, and oil support terrorism.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;Most of these have been mentioned at least peripherally by 
the witnesses that have preceded me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;While much transnational crime exists today apart from 
terrorism, there's almost no terrorism that exists today 
without funding from transnational crime and we need to think 
of these transnational terrorists as diversified businessmen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;They function with a logic that is often used by legitimate 
business so that when the risk increases in the drug trade or 
the profits can be greater in some other area, they diversify. 
That is why we need to look at the diversified portfolio of 
terrorists.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;What the U.N. Security Council did not mention was the role 
of counterfeits. Counterfeits are now probably the most 
lucrative form of transnational crime. Profits from them exceed 
that from drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;And if we go back to the original bombing of the World 
Trade Center in 1993, it's believed that counterfeit t-shirts 
were part of the funding source for that initial attack on the 
United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;So we have the role of counterfeits and the role of 
cigarettes that are major funding sources that are not 
recognized in the Security Council but that deserve much more 
attention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;And terrorists also choose to fund many of their activities 
through least policed forms of criminal activity. So while we 
are chasing them on drugs--and I think that there can be more 
done on drugs--50 percent of their revenues are now coming from 
other areas of activity such as antiquities trade, petty fraud, 
low-level intellectual property crime because those are areas 
that are not commanding much law enforcement attention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;Terrorists also use crime as a weapon and I call that dual-
use crime in that they're deriving profits from it but they 
also degrade political stability in communities through this 
activity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;So that by trading in drugs they keep people subservient or 
incapacitate communities. When they kidnap women and girls, as 
has been done with the Yazidis or Boko Haram, they're 
devastating communities and making them less resistant to their 
activities. This criminal activity can also help destroy 
communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;I think we need to be looking at the problems of drug 
trafficking not only out of Colombia, where it remains a 
significant problem, but looking at it out of Afghanistan where 
there is less territorial control by the central government and 
the Taliban is reasserting itself. We need to look at the 
northern route from Afghanistan through Russia and the southern 
route that goes through Iran into Turkey.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;And we also see Boko Haram and AQIM in Africa being 
involved in this drug trade as well as D-Company, which is a 
hybrid crime terror organization operating out of Pakistan.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;And we need to think also about how fentanyl, which is so 
potent that it can kill people who are transporting it, may be 
used as a weapon of terrorists in the future and not just as a 
form of deriving revenue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;Antiquities trade remains a recurring problem, but as ISIS 
is losing territory it's a possibility that al-Nusra is also 
gaining profits from it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;We need to think about the illicit cigarette trade not just 
here but in North Africa, in the tri-border area where 
Hezbollah is involved, and in other areas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;Terrorists are also involved in energy markets. We've seen 
this with ISIS but also we've seen this in Nigeria and we've 
seen this also in the carbon credit markets of Europe in which 
there were Pakistani-involved groups that were operating out of 
Afghanistan that were involved in hijacking this market.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;And last, we need to look at their role in environmental 
crime, which is an enormous profit source for terrorists, in 
deforestation, in fishing, and in many other areas in which 
profits can be turned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;So we need to be looking at this in the financial streams 
and focus in on public-private partnerships and a whole of 
society approach, not just one of a whole of Government.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="DR. LOUISE SHELLEY"&gt;    Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;Thank you, Dr. Shelley.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;We'll now go into a round of questions. The Chair would now 
recognize himself for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;Dr. Shelley, can you flesh out just a little bit when you 
said that terrorists are now moving into the clean energy using 
the carbon credits or whatever? Can you flesh that out just a 
bit?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;    Dr. Shelley. Certainly. A few years ago, the Europeans 
established a carbon market without proper oversight and at 
that point there were both criminals and terrorists who hacked 
into markets and stole credits and then proceeded to trade them 
with using the VAT (value-added tax) sales and selling them 
with VAT and then getting VAT refunds.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;Dr. Shelley. When our troops were operating in Pakistan--I 
mean, in Afghanistan--they found evidence of some of the 
terrorists profiting from this enormous carbon credit fraud, 
especially that linked with Italy, and the costs of this were 
approximately--for that part of it alone about a billion euros.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;    This crime cost the European community $5 billion. But the 
terrorist part of it is only about a billion.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;OK. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;    Dr. Realuyo, you have--according to briefings that we've 
recently received that ISIS is not getting nearly as much money 
through the sale of oil, at one point that was probably the 
largest source of revenue. What is your independent assessment 
of that source of revenue?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;It's actually quite similar, and perhaps the
most interesting part of our campaign against ISIS was the 
deliberate use of financial targeting, which we had not used in 
previous campaigns by really going after the entire supply 
chain minus the wells in terms of attacking the refinery and 
the income-generating piece for ISIS.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;    We had taken a look and, more importantly, other 
independent analysts had taken a look at a decline in ISIS 
finances by 80 percent from January 2015 until last summer, and 
we do believe that this dramatically contributed to bringing 
ISIS to its knees and its inability to pay its foreign 
fighters, which actually then led to tremendous gains on the 
military campaign--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt; And you would believe that the gains in
the campaign are because they can't--that ISIS can't sustain 
the payments to the people--they were buying their loyalty, 
paying them to do jobs and--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt; --they don't have that flexibility now?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt; And the other thing is that in terms of how
much they made money, about a third came from oil and then a 
third came from extortion, and as the Iraqis and the Syrians 
got--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt; As they lose the territory they lose
access to extortion, too.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt; --they lose the territory, they can't--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;OK. That sounds reasonable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;    Mr. Maltz, you were a head of Project Cassandra and you 
described thoroughly the breakdown in cooperation between 
agencies. Is that what caused Cassandra to sort of fall on its 
face is the lack of cooperation or was there more involved in 
that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Sir, there was a lot more involved. Certainly,
there was a breakdown in cooperation and coordination.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;But, obviously, there were other things that were going on 
at the time. There were other initiatives, other priorities for 
other agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;And so I am not privy to all of those other details, but 
there were things like, for an example, a terrorist like Ali 
Fayed, who's sitting in prison in the Czech Republic who gets 
to walk out and go home to Lebanon instead of being brought 
back here to face justice, pursuant to the rule of law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;    So there's things that happened during Project Cassandra. 
But it's a very complicated question for me to answer in this 
short period of time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt; So you said that you need our help to
cause the walls to break down. Describe a little bit more from 
an agent's point of view what the walls look like. In other 
words--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;OK. A real example would be, right off the bat,
since we are coming up to the fifth anniversary of the Boston 
bombing, when the Russians provided information to our FBI on 
this terrorist, why wouldn't they tap into my center for 
information?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;    What's the answer to that? Not because they didn't want to 
share, because the system doesn't call for that. But we have 
all this criminal intelligence sitting at the Special 
Operations Division that could have helped our JTTF investigate 
this guy Tamerlan for his criminal activities.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt; But we shouldn't have to pass a law to get
the--can't the agency simply say--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt; Of course. Exactly. That's why when people say
we need more authorities, we need more tools, a lot of this has 
to do with we just need some basic cooperation and start 
holding people accountable, and that's where we have failed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;Thank you, sir. Appreciate that. My time
has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;    The Chair would now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, 
Mr. Perlmutter, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perlmutter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;Thanks, Mr. Chair, and Mr. Hill has
interest in the counterfeiting, which I thought was an 
interesting comment from you, Dr. Shelley, and I will let him 
focus on that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;But I want to talk about something--we mentioned Venezuela 
and ISIS and al-Qaida and Hezbollah and North Korea, and Ms. 
Realuyo, you mentioned sort of rogue states and I want to turn 
everybody's attention to Russia for a second.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;We have sanctions against them for a variety of things. But 
really, there wasn't much testimony--I haven't heard yet--from 
the panel about the Russian Mafia, the role that they play, the 
role that the country may play.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;So Dr. Shelley, I will start with you and just, if you 
could, you have some testimony in your--in your written remarks 
about Russia. If you would talk to us a little bit about what 
role you think the Russian Mafia is playing in all of this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;Dr. Shelley. Thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;When I mentioned the northern route that's coming out of 
Afghanistan, that is a route that is very much controlled by 
Russian organized crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;In the beginning, in the early 1990's, Russian organized 
crime was focused primarily on the privatization of state 
resources. But as all the drugs began to come out of 
Afghanistan, they got very, very heavily involved in the drug 
trade and they are prominent international actors in this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;In fact, Celina and I, before the hearing, were talking 
about how she was seeing Russians in Colombia. So they're 
working on their international networks into Latin America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;Also, there was a major political leader in central Russia, 
from Kalmykia, Mr. Ilyumzhinov, who was sanctioned by the U.S. 
Government for his support of Syria and of ISIS. He was a 
criminalized political leader, a supporter of terrorism, and 
kleptocrat who ran the international chess confederation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;    And so you have this unusual confederation of political 
leaders and terrorist groups as with Mr. Ilyumzhinov. I talked 
about how we need to use sanctions not just on the national 
level but on local--regional leaders, like former Kalmykia 
leader, and we need to be focusing not just on drug trafficking 
in Latin America but what is going on in Afghanistan and the 
expanding northern route.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perlmutter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt; OK. Ms. Realuyo, you want to add to that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Well, last week it was pretty interesting to
see how, in pursuant to the Countering America's Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act, we had a series of sanctions imposed 
relating, like, to election meddling as well as this threat to 
the electricity and energy grid and I am hopeful that we are 
going to see more sanctions as the investigation as to who is 
behind the election meddling and other types of pieces. That's 
the political part.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;I think Louise and I have been working quite--for several 
years taking a look at the tentacles of the Russian Mafia, 
which we believe are now working hand in hand with the Mexican 
cartels in order to get cocaine, which we anticipate is five to 
six times the price in Moscow versus Miami.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;So what we've seen is the globalization that's given us as 
international citizens access to cheaper goods and services and 
information. Unfortunately, it's also benefiting what I call 
the dark side of globalization.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;And we've also seen--I've just come back from Colombia on 
Sunday night and I am very disturbed by the news that we've 
seen from the Colombians that they're starting to arrest many 
dozens of Mexicans related to the cartels and we are--part of 
my study now is to understand better how the Mexican cartels 
are actually buying up and trying to control the back end of 
the supply chain as the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia) transition and, more importantly, leave vacant 
spaces.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;    Someone's got to be moving and producing, refining, and, 
more importantly, moving that cocaine. And sadly, as you know, 
some of that cocaine is actually landing on the streets of the 
United States.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perlmutter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt;    Mr. Maltz, in your position with the DEA, again, just my 
focus is more on sort of the Russian connection to all of this 
drug trafficking and just illicit finance around the world, any 
experience that you had or any comments you'd like to make?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt; My experience was limited when it dealt with
Russia. I know, though, from Afghanistan we had a lot of heroin 
going into that region and, obviously, the Russian organized 
crime networks, like, globally and the cyber crime that's out 
there, but that's not my area of expertise, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perlmutter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt; OK. Sir?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Humire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;The Russian Mafia is rampant in Latin America.
They're pretty much present in just about every country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;They're involved in every aspect of organized crime. 
They've been growing. But there's an increasing convergence 
taking place not just with criminals and terrorists--and I will 
speak specifically in Latin America--there's also a convergence 
between criminal networks, terrorist networks, and rogue state 
actors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;The Department of Defense has a framework that they use 
called the four-plus-one where they talk about the biggest 
threats--transnational threats facing our country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;The four biggest state actors--Russia, China, Iran, and 
North Korea--and the plus-one is violent--transnational violent 
extremism.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;You can apply that framework to Latin America, a four-plus-
one framework where you have four anti-American actor states 
that are working against our interests, which would be 
Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Cuba, and then the plus-one 
would be transnational organized crime.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;    These two frameworks are unifying themselves and 
increasingly working together. Russia, China, Iran are working 
through these networks.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Perlmutter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Perlmutter"&gt; And my time has expired. I appreciate
everybody's answer. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;The gentleman's time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, 
Mr. Pittenger, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pittenger&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks, each of
you, again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt;As it relates to our successful efforts in South America, 
how dependent are we upon our collaboration with foreign 
governments and how capable are they? Another part of that 
question was OTA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt;Has OTA been effective and helpful to these countries to 
assess their financial capabilities, their collaboration with 
us, and the--with FIUs as well?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt;    So Mr. Humire, if we could start with you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Humire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Thank you, Congressman, for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;We are absolutely critically dependent on our host nation 
partners in Latin America or elsewhere, anywhere in the world, 
to be able to enforce a lot of the things that are happening in 
terms of sanctions and other designations that happen here in 
the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;I mentioned in my testimony there's been 11 individuals 
that we've sanctioned that are related or affiliated to 
Hezbollah in the tri-border area--a historic fundraising hub 
for that terrorist group.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;These 11 individuals--most of them are still on the streets 
today. They've opened a slew of companies. We've identified at 
least 18 companies that they've opened since 2004 and the 
Brazilian, Paraguayan, and Argentinian authorities are aware of 
this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;And it's not that they don't want to do anything about 
that, but they don't always have the proper legal frameworks to 
go after them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;In Latin America, there is no designation or legal 
authority to go after foreign terrorist organizations. They 
have a lot to go with domestic terror organizations and most of 
the anti-terror laws that were created were designed for that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;But if you're a Hezbollah, al-Qaida, ISIS, you're not 
considered a terrorist until you get involved in a criminal 
act, and until they catch you in a criminal act they let you 
kind of work--operate freely in that country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Until that's fixed, the terrorists are going to continue to 
use those vacuums to be able to move throughout the region.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;So it's very--it's very important--I think one of our 
biggest challenges, and to that end, I think there's a critical 
opportunity in this part of the world to increase partnerships.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;I know, Congressman, you have been there plenty of times in 
your work at building this network. Argentina, Peru, Guatemala, 
Brazil, Ecuador, Panama are all countries critical to this 
fight and these are countries that I would say maybe half a 
decade ago wouldn't be considered U.S. partners, at least some 
of these.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;    But the political winds have changed and that creates a 
tremendous opportunity for us here in the United States.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pittenger&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt; Mr. Maltz.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;So to answer your question, I could say that
when I was at SOD for about 10 years, Colombia, as an example, 
was one of our greatest partners.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;And so with Project Cassandra, just to make it clear, when 
that case first started it was because of the money launderers 
in the United States that were sending money back to--around 
the world but it was Colombia that opened up the investigation 
for us and identified the Middle Eastern presence.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;So we had all these Lebanese guys that were inside of 
Colombia and they were moving millions and millions of dollars 
and tons of cocaine but it was the Colombian national police 
investigation that led to us identifying this global network. 
So we can't downplay the level of significance with the 
cooperation in Colombia alone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;You know, as far as the extraditions out of Colombia, we 
know the power of extraditions. That's what we are trying to do 
in Mexico.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;You know, like, if we judicialize our efforts and we 
collect evidence and we prosecute people and we extradite them, 
that's going to be a home run for the communities all over 
Latin America.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;So we use Colombia as a success model. You know, we try to 
actually go out and educate other countries. But they're very 
limited.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;So as one quick story, just to give you an idea, when we 
were doing our trade-based money laundering case, all the calls 
were in Arabic. The Colombians didn't even have translators to 
actually listen to the calls that they were intercepting.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;    So the U.S. had to work with them and kind of help. But so 
yes, they have some limited capabilities but they're advancing 
and are working very closely with us.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pittenger&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;Just to complement--not just extraditions. Our
export of the concept of asset forfeiture has now been adopted 
by many of our Latin American partners including Mexico and 
Colombia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;    I was just in Colombia last week and met with the Bank of 
the Republica, which is their version of Central Bank, and 
they're using asset forfeiture now to recuperate the assets of 
the FARC, which will be actually used to pay the distribution 
for the victimizations fund.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pittenger&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt; Do you believe the FARC agreement is--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pittenger&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt; --a valid agreement and is workable?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt; It is, but it has to still be implemented, and
then a bigger question is as the groups there start to morph, 
someone is going to take the place of the FARC.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pittenger&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt; Sure.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;As you will remember, the FARC actually took
the place of the Medellin and Cali cartels. So we are trying to 
figure out what that evolution of mafias are going to be, 
coming forward, because someone's going to be--have to be 
moving those amazing amounts of cocaine that are being 
produced.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;    The other one that's--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pittenger&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt; They're not spraying it anymore?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;No. That's right. That's why.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;    And then the other piece is--and we are seeing there's 
going to be a change in government. August 7th there will be a 
new president of Colombia and hopefully they'll be revisiting 
that issue, and President Trump will be going to Colombia on 
April 15th and both issues, cocaine trafficking and Venezuela, 
will be, we anticipate, the top topics.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pittenger&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Pittenger"&gt; My time has expired. Sorry, Ms. Shelley.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;All right. The gentleman's time has
expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. 
Kildee, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kildee&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for holding
this hearing, the Ranking Member as well for his leadership on 
his question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;And so I will try to be brief because I know we've got 
votes. As everyone on this committee is aware, this opioid 
epidemic is killing us. Rural communities, urban communities, 
800 people a week dying from opioid-related overdoses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;No sign that it's curtailing at all, and this epidemic is 
perpetuated by lots of things, particularly synthetic opioids 
like fentanyl, often supplied by foreign-based cartels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;And so I was curious--Dr. Shelley in particular but others 
could answer if they would like after you--you state that due 
to the strong potency of fentanyl and thinking about 
carfentanyl in particular, used as a terrorist tool.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;Number one, is that just frightening speculation or is 
there some evidence that that's a possibility? And second, can 
you paint a picture as to what that might look like for this 
country?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;Dr. Shelley. It's not just speculation. To do my research I 
talk to people who actually work in the system, and some of 
them have talked about the problems of how people who are just 
handling fentanyl that's coming through the mail are sometimes 
harmed. The lessons of what this product can do are evident to 
people who are as innovative as the terrorists and their 
criminal facilitators.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;What is really distinctive about our drug problem in the 
U.S. is that, despite all of the trafficking of heroin into 
Europe, we are having so many dying in the U.S. as opposed to 
in western Europe. The cause of American deaths is that the 
fentanyl being mixed with the heroin, and that's our particular 
drug problem that's killing so many people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;    And I think we need to be much more flexible in approaching 
this problem. We haven't talked enough probably in our hearing 
today about the online marketplaces that are facilitating the 
sale of drugs and that is part of the American problem with 
fentanyl.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kildee&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;In those cases, if I may interrupt, these
substances are coming in through our legal ports of entry. 
They're not being tossed over a wall, right?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;We are talking about the 52 legal ports of entry which not 
only might be the source for fentanyl but for the vast majority 
of the illicit drugs that come into this country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;I only say that because there's so much debate right now 
about the impact that a wall on the southern border might have 
on drug trafficking. The truth of the matter is much of this is 
coming in through the United States mail, for goodness sakes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;Dr. Shelley. Exactly. It's coming through mail services, 
mail--the U.S. Postal Service, and we had a conference.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;    If you're interested, I am happy to share with you a 
conference we had in mid-October at George Mason on the opioid 
crisis and had people from the Postal Service and others 
looking at this issue and how much it is not a border issue but 
something that needs much more data analytics and much more 
ability to identify packages and flows that could help stop 
some of this trade.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kildee&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;Would the panel generally agree even if we were
able to somehow affect what the President has essentially 
referred to as sealing the southern border that that would not 
eliminate the problem of illicit drug trafficking coming into 
the United States and in fact they would just find another 
pathway?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;    Is that generally accepted logic? Any members of the panel.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt; Except that the Mexican cartels have their
hands--they're knee deep in both the heroin and--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kildee&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt; They don't have the ability to use any of the
other delivery systems that would--that have typically been 
used as well? I guess that's the point.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Realuyo&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;We do, but we understand that the fentanyl is
also coming into the Mexican ports and in May--on May 15th at 
National Defense University, my organization is partnering with 
ONDCP to take a look at the entire chain, first, raising 
awareness to reduce the actual consumption here in the U.S.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;And we are actually inviting our Mexican counterparts who 
are now starting to see consumption on their side of the border 
to actually address all of the different components of the 
supply chain, and then raise awareness, including some Members 
of Congress, because it's such a burning issue in every one of 
our districts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;And the bigger question that we have is how the 
distributors here in the U.S. are actually mixing fentanyl with 
heroin and with cocaine, and the complaints--it's kind of 
interesting that the cartel leaders are complaining that the 
local distributors here--the objective is to make them addicts, 
not to actually kill the consumer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. Realuyo"&gt;    It's kind of in a weird way kind of interesting is their 
perception, because they're--as referring to what Louise is 
saying, these are entrepreneurs and businessmen and women who 
are all about the profit, and a dead user is not of interest to 
the Mexican cartels.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Kildee&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;Well, I thank the panel. My time has expired
and I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for holding this 
hearing. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Kildee"&gt;    I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Chairman Pearce&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;Gentleman's time has expired. The members
are advised that we have a vote going on and we've got 8 
minutes and 43 seconds left.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;I could take one more of the questioners. I guess my 
question to members is do you want to come back afterwards to 
ask questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Chairman Pearce"&gt;    OK. So we'll just take Mr. Rothfus and we'll let you ask 
questions. Then we'll adjourn the hearing after that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;Mr. Maltz, the 2017 political article on how the previous 
Administration wilfully ignored Hezbollah's massive global drug 
trafficking operation was shocking, especially given 
Hezbollah's anti-U.S. conduct, even in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;    Can you describe the extent of Hezbollah's involvement with 
the Colombian drug trade?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Well, in that case, we saw multi tons of cocaine
leaving South America, going to Africa, drugs being distributed 
worldwide, moneys being collected, put on Middle Eastern 
flights, carried into Beirut, guarded by Hezbollah, moneys 
coming back through the exchange houses into banks in Lebanon, 
back to America to buy used cars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Cars are sold--sent on Hezbollah shipping lines back to 
west Africa to resell. In that case, the one thing that is 
still shocking to me as a taxpayer is that we collectively in 
the interagency identified about 300 businesses in our 
neighborhoods. We only attached 30 to our action because we 
could not get the cooperation across the Government agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;    So there's hundreds of businesses still operating in our 
country because we were never able to shut them down. So $200 
million a month going through this scheme just by one kingpin, 
Ayman Joumaa, is pretty significant.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt; Besides Colombia, are there other Central and
South American nations that you can identify that are 
facilitating or tolerating Hezbollah's presence in their 
countries?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Well, of course, all over the tri-border. But
Venezuela was the control--command and control hub for all the 
multi-ton shipments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;    The problem was that the government was so corrupt that the 
highest levels of the government where we had guys indicted but 
they walked out of jail and they went back to their countries.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt; So are they tolerating them more because of
the kickbacks, the money, or--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt; It's all about the money.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt; So no ideological thing--this is all just
money driven?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt; In my opinion, it was about the money. General
Carvajal was in charge of their security at the airport. So 
when multi-ton quantities of cocaine were leaving to go 
worldwide it was all about the money and--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt; What do we--what do we know about any links
between Hezbollah and any of the Mexican cartels? There was 
reference to Los Zetas in the Politico piece.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;Well, in that particular case, the Eastern
District of Virginia did an indictment on Ayman Joumaa and they 
alleged in the indictment that the cocaine proceeds that were 
being laundered by Ayman Joumaa were from the Los Zetas cartel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;What I will tell you is a DEA undercover agent went to 
Guatemala and picked up $20 million in suitcases in cash from 
the cartel because they were sitting on $100 million and they 
needed money to be laundered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;    So real--$20 million in three deliveries in Guatemala. So 
yes, there's a lot of money involved.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt; Do you think we've lost anything over the last
year and a half as a result of the actions of the prior 
Administration with respect to Cassandra?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt; I am sorry. That question--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt; Have we lost anything? Have we lost ground?
Have we--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt; Well, anytime--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt; --by not aggressively pursuing this at the
time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Maltz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;OK. So I am going to answer this really
directly. Ali Fayed wanted the head of an American back in 
Czech Republic and we let him walk out and go back to Lebanon. 
So yes, we've lost a lot of intelligence for our U.S. 
Government agencies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Maltz"&gt;    It would have been nice to debrief Walid Makled or General 
Carvajal to see what's going on in these different countries. 
But they walked out. They're gone.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Rothfus&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;Mr. Humire, you noted in your testimony the
convergence of criminals, terrorists, and organized crime can 
be traced back to the 1990's.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;But those interactions were mostly transactional back then. 
Now it appears that those interactions have metastasized into a 
very dangerous global network.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"&gt;    What are the largest transnational criminal threats facing 
the United States today?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Humire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;Congressman, what I mentioned earlier was the
convergence that extends just beyond the illicit actors or the 
non-state actors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;I believe there's now a convergence with rogue state 
actors, and the state actors provide cover, concealment, and 
state support.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;In the case of Venezuela, we've seen the Venezuelan 
government providing documentation--passports, birth 
certificates, national IDs--to members of terrorist groups, the 
Lebanese Hezbollah probably the most prominent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;But I want to touch on your earlier point, Congressman, 
about the collaboration between Hezbollah and Colombia. It's 
very historic and it's very extensive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;The AMIA bombing, which we all are familiar with--1994 
attack in Buenos Aires that killed 84 people--that attack--the 
explosives for that attack were trans shipped from the Middle 
East to Colombia to Argentina and were trans shipped by the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;The Hezbollah operative that was--is a Colombian Lebanese 
national that operated in the tri-border area in Colombia that 
was the logistical man that carried about that attack, Samuel 
Salman el-Reda, is one of the chief operators in the top 
hierarchy of the command today in the IJO--International Jihad 
Organization--of Hezbollah.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Humire"&gt;    So there's a long, extensive collaboration between Latin 
American cartels, transnational criminal organizations and 
Hezbollah particularly but other terrorist groups.
