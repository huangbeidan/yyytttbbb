    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREGG HARPER, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I now call to order this hearing on ``Combating
the Opioid Epidemic: Examining Concerns About Distribution and 
Diversion.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;One year ago today, on May the 8th, 2017, the committee 
opened a bipartisan investigation into the distribution of 
prescription opioids by wholesale drug distributors with a 
specific focus on unusually large opioid shipments to small 
pharmacies in West Virginia. The launch of this investigation 
was spurred by press reports of astonishing levels of opioid 
distribution to pharmacies in small, rural West Virginia towns.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Between 2007 and 2012, distributors sent more than 700 
million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills to the State, or 433 
pills for every man, woman, and child in the State. In that 
timeframe, 1,728 West Virginians fatally overdosed on these two 
drugs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The numbers were eye-opening. The Sav-Rite pharmacy in 
Kermit, West Virginia, population around 400, received nearly 9 
million opioids in a 2-year period. Another pharmacy, in nearby 
Oceana, West Virginia, received 600 times as many oxycodone 
pills as the Rite Aid drugstore just eight blocks away.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;This led the committee, on a bipartisan basis, to request 
information from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the 
so-called Big Three drug distributors: McKesson, Cardinal 
Health, and AmerisourceBergen. These distributors delivered 
more than 500 million opioids to West Virginia between 2007 and 
2012, with Cardinal shipping 241 million opioids, 
AmerisourceBergen shipping about 119 million opioids, and 
McKesson shipping more than 150 million opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Later in the investigation the committee also sent letters 
to two regional distributors with a major presence in West 
Virginia, Miami-Luken and H.D. Smith. We found that the 
stunning numbers that led us to start this investigation were 
much more common than we had hoped.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Among our discoveries are a single pharmacy in Mount Gay-
Shamrock, West Virginia, population 1,779, that received more 
than 16.5 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills between 2006 
and 2016. In nearby Williamson, West Virginia, population 
2,900, distributors sent almost 21 million opioids to two 
pharmacies during the same period. And this is just within the 
targeted areas that we reviewed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;We have learned much from the investigation but still have 
many questions. For example, why did the distributors 
repeatedly fail to report suspicious orders of opioids or 
exercise effective controls against diversion?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;By 2005, internet pharmacies had transformed the DEA 
regulatory paradigm with unprecedented large volumes of 
controlled substances being shipped to individual pharmacies. 
Pill mill doctors and pharmacies began to proliferate. The 
agency needed help, and given their position in the supply 
chain and their legal obligations to identify and report 
suspicious orders, identified the distributors as a main line 
of defense against diversion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Through meetings and letters over a period of years, the 
DEA educated and coached the distributors on their 
responsibilities. The distributors have contended that the DEA 
provided insufficient communication and guidance. Distributors 
have also said that only the DEA can see the full picture with 
respect to pharmacy volume and that distributors are simply 
privy to their own data.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;But were distributors' capabilities that limited? 
Distributors conduct due diligence, site visits, and can obtain 
market data. They can request and analyze a pharmacy's 
dispensing data, which provides the distributors with the 
ability to see all the controlled substances being dispensed by 
a pharmacy and the prescribers over a given period of time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;In some cases, such as what we have seen in West Virginia, 
the volume of controlled substances a distributor sends on its 
own should be cause for concern.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Distributors also contend that they do not set demand and 
simply satisfy orders for prescriptions written by licensed 
doctors and filled by licensed pharmacists. But what about the 
distributor's legal responsibility to know their customer and 
perform due diligence?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And what does our work mean for the rest of the country? 
West Virginia is far from the only State heavily impacted by 
the opioid epidemic. It has hit every State, and everyone in 
this room has been affected in some way.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;How many other communities across the country have received 
millions more opioids than their communities could reasonably 
sustain? How many other times did a distributor miss the red 
flags of their own distribution, let alone what could be found 
with due diligence? How many other Kermits and Williamsons are 
out there?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;It is my hope that we will see some answers today as to how 
the drug distributors seemingly missed the red flags of 
diversion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I want to welcome the witnesses and thank each of you for 
your participation to help us in this important investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I also thank my colleagues from across the aisle for all of 
their hard work on this bipartisan investigation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DEGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. DIANA DEGETTE"&gt; And I now recognize the ranking member of the
subcommittee, Ms. DeGette.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;This investigation has been bipartisan. And as you 
mentioned, it was a year ago today when we sent our first 
letters to three of the drug wholesale distributors before us 
today. Those letters described the devastation of the opioid 
crisis, and they referenced a report that, over 6 years, 
distributors showered the State with 780 million hydrocodone 
and oxycodone pills while 1,728 West Virginians fatally 
overdosed on those two painkillers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Over the last year, we learned a lot more about the full 
scope of the epidemic in West Virginia. As the chairman said, 
we obtained data showing that pharmacies in tiny towns received 
millions of pills in just a few years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;But our work is not finished. We want to know what these 
companies knew about the rise of the opioid epidemic, when they 
knew it, and whether it informed their distribution practices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;In fact, over a decade ago the DEA sent letters to all 
registered distributors informing them that, quote, ``The abuse 
of controlled prescription drugs is a serious and growing 
health problem in this country,'' end quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;In 2007, CDC reported that drug overdose deaths nationwide 
increased by 276 percent between 1999 and 2014, and in West 
Virginia, drug overdose deaths were up by 550 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;A well-publicized 2008 JAMA study specifically implicated 
prescription opioids in the rise of overdose deaths.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;In 2010, the New England Journal of Medicine article, ``A 
Flood of Opioids, a Rising Tide of Deaths,'' showed that the 
prescription opioids death toll continued to rise, particularly 
in West Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;In 2011, the Charleston Gazette published a major story 
describing how residents began calling the town of Williamson, 
quote, ``Pilliamson,'' because so many opioids had flooded that 
town.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;And this is just a small sampling of the articles that 
highlighted the rise of this epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;So yet, even as this information was coming out, it appears 
that, over 3 years, distributors sent more than 11 million 
pills to one pharmacy in a town of 400 and more than 12 million 
total pills to two pharmacies in a town of 3,000. I mean, come 
on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I know we are going to hear from the distributors that they 
had systems in place and that they only fill orders by 
pharmacies that hold valid DEA licenses. At the end the day, 
however, I think we can all agree, whatever systems were in 
place did not prevent damage to these communities caused by 
what appears to be the excessive supply of opioid pills.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Some of the counties that have been the focus of the 
investigation have the highest death and overdose rates in the 
Nation. The epidemic has devastated families throughout that 
State, and it has placed huge burdens on the State's healthcare 
system, its child welfare program, and its economy as a whole.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Now, we need to understand the root causes of how we let 
this happen and why distributors apparently supplied so many 
opioids to certain small town pharmacies. For example, how did 
the tiny town of Kermit, with a population of 400, receive 9 
million pills in just 2 years? Shouldn't the distributors' 
suspicious order systems have immediately flagged and halted 
shipment of this magnitude? And shouldn't the distributors have 
examined them more closely to determine the appropriateness for 
shipping them?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I also want to understand why major drug companies failed 
to have adequate suspicious order reporting programs in place 
and were forced to have to settle with the DOJ and the DEA not 
once, but twice during this epidemic. Do the distributors 
believe that any of their suspicious order reporting system 
failed? And if so, how?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I hope what we learn today will help us inform 
investigations all across the country, including in Colorado, 
which has had similar concerns raised about overdistribution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying we agree it is 
critical that we understand what happened and how the Nation 
has found itself in the grip of this opioid crisis. But at the 
same time, I think that the overall committee needs to make 
sure that we have adequate resources available to help those in 
need and to get people like those in the hard-hit places we 
will be talking about today the recovery that they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;As we look back on what happened, we cannot turn our backs 
on those who were devastated by this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;Exactly 1 year ago today, this committee sent our first

today. Our letters described the devastation of the opioid

population of 400 hundred receive 9 million pills in just 2 
years? Should the distributors' suspicious order systems have

examined them more closely to determine their appropriateness 
before shipping them?&lt;/paragraph&gt;

in other States, including Colorado, which has had similar 
concerns raised concerning over distribution, going forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Hon. Diana DeGette"&gt;Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying that it is critical 
that we understand what happened and how the Nation has found 
itself in the grip of this ongoing opioid crisis. But at the 
same time, I also believe we commit to making adequate 
resources available to help those in need, and get people, such 
as those in the hard hit places we will be talking about today, 
the recovery help they need. As we look back at what happened, 
we cannot turn our backs on those who have been devastated by 
this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Over the last few years, the Energy and Commerce Committee 
has conducted multiple investigations, enacted major bipartisan 
legislation, and helped authorize historic levels of funding to 
help those battling this epidemic in our communities all across 
America. But clearly we have much more work to do, including 
two important hearings and a full committee markup this week on 
this issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Our efforts continue on two tracks. One is to provide new 
legislative solutions, new laws, new programs to combat the 
crisis. And the second track is to continue our yearlong 
investigation into its causes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;As you have heard before, today's hearing marks a 1-year 
anniversary since we first asked the Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the Nation's largest distributors of opioids 
for information about the overwhelming amount of prescription 
opiates that flooded into countless communities all across the 
United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;After hearing from the DEA in March, it is important that 
today we hear from the executives who lead the most influential 
pharmaceutical distribution companies in America. We have tough 
questions for you today. You know that. But we ask you these 
questions in order for all of us to find solutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Today, a thousand people will go into emergency rooms 
overdosing on opioids. Today in America, 115 people will die 
from opioid addiction and overdose. This is why we are moving 
forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;A decade ago, the DEA realized that its enforcement 
strategy had to change to fight the rising tide of internet 
pharmacies, internet pharmacies and pill mills. With more than 
a million DEA registrants, the DEA simply could not fight this 
only at an individual doctor and pharmacy level.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So to more effectively and efficiently combat this emerging 
law enforcement challenge, the DEA asked the drug distributors 
to play a more proactive role in identifying, analyzing, and 
reporting and blocking suspicious orders of controlled 
substances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;In 2005, the DEA started the Distributor Initiative 
Program. That program had a goal of educating registrants on 
maintaining effective controls against diversion and monitoring 
for and reporting suspicious orders. DEA held individual 
meetings in 2005 and 2006 with McKesson, with Cardinal Health, 
and AmerisourceBergen, and instructed companies on how to 
identify and submit reports of suspicious orders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;In 2006 and 2007, the DEA sent three letters to all DEA-
registered distributors to put them on notice about their legal 
obligations. However, soon after the start of this initiative, 
each of these three companies faced enforcement actions, in 
2007 and 2008, for failures to maintain effective controls 
against the diversion of controlled substances. Cardinal Health 
and McKesson each paid civil penalties totaling millions of 
dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Meanwhile, the opioid crisis worsened over the next decade, 
especially in ravaged communities like we have heard about this 
morning and in our investigations in small towns in West 
Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Even after the 2008 settlements, while concerns rose over 
the opioid epidemic, some distributors were still failing to 
exercise effective controls against diversion. This led to more 
enforcement actions and more settlements, including a record-
setting $150 million civil penalty by McKesson in 2017. It 
remains an open question today whether the distributors have 
finally achieved effective DEA compliance programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Since the 1970s, distributors have had a statutory 
responsibility under the Controlled Substances Act to exercise 
due diligence to report and avoid filling suspicious orders. 
This responsibility is due to their unique position in the 
marketplace. They are the chokepoints in the U.S. prescription 
drug supply chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Three of those that are before us today, McKesson, Cardinal 
Health, and AmerisourceBergen, account for about 85 percent of 
the drug supply. So it is not sufficient just to blame the DEA, 
although we have our own issues with the DEA's role in this. 
You have a unique set of resources and tools at your disposal 
and a shared responsibility in flagging suspicious activity and 
diversion. You are on the front lines of the defense in this 
crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Instead, the information uncovered by the investigation 
over the last year is stunning. There is no logical explanation 
that we can find for why a town of approximately 400 people 
would receive 9 million opioid pills in 2 years or why a single 
pharmacy in a town of 1,800 people would receive nearly 17 
million opioid pills in a decade. Then there are two pharmacies 
in a nearby town of 2,900 people which received nearly 21 
million opioids in the same timeframe.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;No matter how you cut these data, behind each of these 
numbers was a pill mill, and they proliferated for far too 
long.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So given what we know about the volume of opioid shipments 
to small towns in West Virginia and the associated pill mills 
and diversion schemes in those areas, it is difficult not to be 
troubled by the compliance efforts by our Nation's 
distributors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So we look forward to getting a better understanding of the 
facts and to finally have this necessary and frank 
conversation. We owe it to the 115 Americans who will die today 
and every day from opioid overdoses and to their loved ones to 
understand what led to this crisis and to identify solutions to 
stem the tide.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    <Statement>
    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR., A REPRESENTATIVEIN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. FRANK PALLONE"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the ranking member for the 
full committee, Mr. Pallone.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;The opioid epidemic continues to devastate this country, 
and virtually no community in America has been left untouched. 
West Virginia in particular has been severely affected. For the 
last several years, West Virginia has had the highest overdose 
death rate in the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;This committee's investigation has uncovered some very 
troubling information about seemingly large shipments of 
opioids from drug distributors to rural pharmacies in West 
Virginia over the course of several years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;And I think it is important for us to understand what went 
wrong and why, but we must also understand what needs to change 
so that we do not ever find ourselves in this situation again. 
For example, there is simply no excuse for distributors sending 
more than 13 million doses of opioids to a single pharmacy in a 
town of just over 400 people over a 6-year period.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Some of the distributors who supplied high amounts of pills 
to this pharmacy appear not to have submitted suspicious order 
reports to DEA even though the law requires them to do so. In 
addition, some of the distributor's files are either sparse or 
unavailable, raising additional questions about whether they 
investigated the risk of diversion before shipping these pills.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;In the end, Federal authorities raided and shut down this 
pharmacy, and its owner went to jail. And we must understand 
what went wrong here so that we can be sure that no town is 
ever again flooded with pills.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;In another case, two doctors in the town of Williamson 
prescribed more opiates than entire hospitals did, according to 
a Justice Department press release, and these doctors were in 
fact the highest opioid prescribers in the entire State and 
were widely known to be running pill mills. One of these 
doctors ultimately went to jail; the other fled overseas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;It appears that certain distributor systems failed to 
detect the volume of prescriptions these pharmacies were 
filling for these doctors, which may have led to oversupply and 
diversion of pills.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;It is the distributors' responsibility to know their 
customers, monitor orders, refuse suspicious orders, and report 
those orders to DEA. Distributors must perform these functions 
particularly when pharmacies order high volumes of opioids. But 
our investigation has shown that this did not always happen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;In fact, some of these distributors paid large fines to DOJ 
because their systems failed and because they did not report 
suspicious orders to DEA as required. And these distributors 
promised to clean up their act, but just a few years later, 
they were again hit with multimillion-dollar fines for the very 
same shortcomings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So I want to know how we can be confident that distributors 
have sufficiently improved their systems now so that going 
forward we will not miss key indicators that may help uncover 
diversion in other situations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;For example, one distributor told us that, with the benefit 
of hindsight, they wished they had asked different questions of 
at least two of the pharmacies we have examined. And I would 
like to know what kind of questions they believe will make the 
process more effective and reduce the possibility of diversion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Mr. Chairman, this is a nationwide concern. The problems we 
found in West Virginia have broader lessons for the rest of the 
county.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I also want point out that this investigation focused on 
the role the distributors played in this crisis, but we know 
that there are many causes of this epidemic. This includes the 
role of some manufacturers in manufacturing these drugs, the 
role of some rogue physicians in overprescribing them, and the 
failure of regulators at the State and Federal level to 
adequately oversee the opioid supply chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;But let me also highlight another important aspect of this 
committee's work which I hope will not be lost as we look as 
how events unfolded in the past, because this crisis is far 
from over. Right now countless Americans, including those in 
the hard-hit areas of West Virginia, still need to access 
quality healthcare to help them recover from the opioid crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;In the past month, we have marked up a substantial number 
of opioid-related bills, and I am still concerned that we have 
made this push without taking the time to make sure we get it 
right without much of an emphasis on treatment. It is not 
enough to only look backwards at this crisis. We must take the 
necessary steps to actually help those who are suffering by 
providing comprehensive treatment to individuals and 
communities in need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Unless someone wants my minute, I will yield it back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

Subcommittee Chairman Harper, Ranking Members Pallone and 
DeGette, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank

you for your tireless efforts to address our Nation's ongoing 
opioid epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;I would like to share some background about Miami-Luken 
with you. The company was originally cofounded by my father, 
Robert E. Mastandrea, in 1962 as the Miami Valley Wholesale 
Drug Company in Dayton, Ohio. Nine years later, in 1971, the 
acquired the A.G. Luken Drug Company of Richmond, Indiana. It 
was then that the company Miami-Luken was born.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;Since then, the company has made additional acquisitions in 
Ohio and West Virginia, yet has always remained a relatively 
small regional distributors.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;I first started working for the company at the age of 14 
working in the warehouse. After graduating college, I worked a 
short time with my father learning the day-to-day operations of 
the business where I was involved in making sales calls, 
deliveries, and various warehouse duties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;It was a wonderful place to work, and I was proud of my 
father and what he had achieved. He was born in Italy and came 
to this country at the age of 13. He subsequently graduated 
from college and began a business career that would lead to the 
formation of Miami-Luken. Through my father's leadership, the 
company's culture was more like a family than just a place to 
work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;I entered medical school in 1979 and after my residency 
embarked on a full-time career as a physician in Dayton. 
Several years later I was asked to serve on the board of 
directors of Miami-Luken, which I accepted. Some years later, I 
became the chairman of the board and have held that position 
since that time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;Management of the company remained pretty much the same 
until 2007 when a new president was appointed by the board. 
This individual had extensive managerial experience in both the 
wholesale drug business and the wholesale grocery business and 
was more than qualified to lead the company. He was 
knowledgeable, confident, and well-liked by the company's 
employees.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;It was not until several years later, in 2013, after the 
board learned that the DEA had issued a number of subpoenas to 
the company, that we realized the Government had concerns with 
the company's compliance efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;In response, we retained the services of a prominent 
attorney here in Washington who used to work for the DEA. This 
attorney worked with management to assist the company in 
fulfilling its DEA compliance obligations. We also instructed 
the company's president to purchase a computer program to 
better identify suspicious orders from customers, which he did.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;When we subsequently learned that management was having 
difficulties with the computer system they purchased, it was 
apparent to us that we needed someone more capable in that 
position. The board immediately began looking for a replacement 
and after considering several individuals hired the company's 
current president and CEO, Michael Faul.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;In addition to hiring Mr. Faul, the company hired a new 
director of compliance and security who worked with Mr. Faul to 
implement a number of significant changes in the company's 
compliance program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;These included more frequent and robust customer visits by 
compliance staff, greater scrutiny of requests from customers 
to increase purchase quantities, increased facility and 
transportation security, implementation of compliance training, 
purchase of the NTIS database, enhancing the controlled 
substance profile that customers are required to complete 
during the on-boarding process, and the complete overhaul of 
Miami-Luken's standard operating procedures regarding DEA 
compliance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;The compliance director also worked with the software 
vendor to recalibrate the company's computerized suspicious 
orders notification system, improved its effectiveness in 
identifying suspicious orders on a daily basis, and started the 
process of uploading all relevant data on shared computer 
drives providing employees and DEA investigators easier access 
to information pertaining to individual customers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;He also hired additional staff to assist the company in its 
compliance efforts and created a new analytical tool on an 
Excel spreadsheet to assist in conducting due diligence on 
current and prospective customers. In fact, the compliance 
director last year was recognized by the National Association 
of Drug Diversion Investigators for his outstanding work in 
drug diversion prevention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;As a result of new management's enhanced compliance 
efforts, Miami-Luken terminated its relationship with multiple 
customers, many of whom are still in business purchasing from 
other sources. Since 2014, we have reduced the sale of 
oxycodone by approximately two-thirds and the sale of 
hydrocodone by a similar margin.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;It is our understanding that former management took what 
they believed to be sufficient steps at the time, believing 
that the State medical boards and State pharmacy boards were in 
a strong position to monitor the physicians and pharmacists 
they licensed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;Former management also believed that since Miami-Luken 
regularly provided the DEA with sales data for all its 
customers, the Government would have advised us if they had any 
concerns with sales to specific parties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="JOSEPH R. MASTANDREA"&gt;Unfortunately, we know that is not enough. And as you know 
from the materials we have provided this committee last year, 
Miami-Luken has taken aggressive action going back several 
years to strengthen its compliance efforts and suspicious order 
monitoring system and reporting. And as I sit here now, I can 
assure you that our company employs a compliance program that 
is second to none.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF JOHN HAMMERGREN&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="JOHN HAMMERGREN"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize John Hammergren, chairman, 
president, and CEO of McKesson Corporation, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member DeGette, and
members of the subcommittee, my name is John Hammergren, and 
for almost two decades I've had the privilege to serve as the 
chief executive officer of McKesson Corporation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;The impact the opioid epidemic has had on our Nation is 
devastating. Millions of Americans have been affected, 
including employees of McKesson and their families. We 
recognize the importance of this committee's investigation, and 
I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to help 
the committee address this crisis. I will also explain the 
steps that we ourselves are taking.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;Our company has over 70,000 employees worldwide. Our 
distribution business receives 275,000 orders every day, 
serving 40,000 pharmacies and hospitals. Like all distributors, 
we have two critical priorities: to deliver medicines to 
pharmacies and hospitals when and where they need them and to 
help the protect the integrity of the supply chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;As a distributor, we don't manufacture prescription drugs, 
we don't market them to doctors or patients, nor do we market 
any particular category of drugs, such as opioids, to 
pharmacists. Distributors respond to pharmacy orders, which are 
based on doctor's prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;For years we have reported every controlled substance 
transaction that we have made in West Virginia and across the 
country to the DEA. Other distributors provide similar 
information so that only the DEA has an overall view of opioids 
distributed in this country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;Distributing controlled substances represents a small share 
of McKesson's total business. The two schedules of controlled 
substances that include the most commonly abused prescription 
opioids constitute approximately 3 to 4 percent of our total 
revenue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;The committee has highlighted a large volume of opioids 
distributed to pharmacies in West Virginia by McKesson and 
other distributors. Over a 6-year period addressed by the 
committee, McKesson distributed approximately 151 million doses 
of oxycodone and hydrocodone there.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;To put that into some perspective, if you look at all 
prescription drugs of any kind that McKesson distributed, the 
total number was nearly 2 billion doses in West Virginia during 
the same period.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;There is no question that a key driver of the crisis, as 
the CDC has said, is the overprescribing of opioids by doctors 
across the country. At the same time, there clearly were 
certain pharmacies in West Virginia that were bad actors that 
McKesson itself terminated. In hindsight, I would have liked to 
have seen us move much more quickly to identify the issues with 
these pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;We learned important lessons, so let me tell you how we're 
applying those lessons today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;Over the last 5 years, we have successfully used the latest 
technology and the best available expertise to strengthen 
controls. We have invested millions of dollars in enhancing our 
controlled substance monitoring program, or CSMP. A key part of 
that is sophisticated data analytics designed by outside 
experts which harness the power of advanced statistical models 
to set caps on sales to individual pharmacies. And then we 
block sales that exceed those caps, which are constantly 
monitored and fine-tuned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;Our CSMP team is independent of the business and has 
unilateral authority to deny a customer access to controlled 
substances. Our team includes former DEA agents with more than 
240 years of collective DEA enforcement experience.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;And the CSMP is working. In fact, over the last decade, we 
blocked and reported to the DEA over 1 million suspicious 
orders nationwide.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;With a strong program in place today to monitor sales of 
opioids, we are extremely focused on advancing solutions to the 
country's opioid crisis more broadly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;First, we are moving forward with the development of a 
prescription safety alert system. This would be an electronic 
system to provide doctors and pharmacies with real-time red 
flags based on a patient's nationwide prescription history. 
Congress and the FDA can help make this a reality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;Second, we are requiring our customers to accept electronic 
prescriptions in 2019. Handwritten prescriptions are more prone 
to fraud.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;Third, we're pushing for opioid manufacturers to use 
limited dose packaging, such as blister packs, to facilitate 
smaller prescription sizes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;And fourth, we've announced the formation of a foundation 
to fight the opioid epidemic and committed $100 million dollars 
to launch its mission.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;McKesson and I personally fully understand the gravity of 
this crisis and our essential role in helping to address it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Hammergren.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;STATEMENT OF GEORGE S. BARRETT&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="GEORGE S. BARRETT"&gt;    Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Chairman Harper, Ranking Member DeGette, and
members of the subcommittee, Chairman Walden, Ranking Member 
Pallone, and other members of the full committee, thank you for 
the opportunity to be here today. I also want to extend my 
thanks to your staff for their professionalism and courtesy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;My name is George Barrett, and I have committed my 
professional career to healthcare in a wide range of roles for 
over three decades. Between 2009 and 2017, I was privileged to 
serve as CEO and chairman of Cardinal Health, which today is 
composed of more than 50,000 dedicated men and women.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;We simply cannot look at the impact of opioid abuse on so 
many lives and not feel sorrow. I speak for the entire Cardinal 
Health team when I say that we care deeply about the 
devastation that opioid abuse is causing families and 
communities around our country. We are resolved to be a 
constructive part of the effort to alleviate this complex 
national public health crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Some of the issues we will discuss today involve the 
healthcare system in our neighboring State of West Virginia 
where hundreds of our employees live and work. The people of 
West Virginia are not just the recipients of the medicine and 
the medical products we distribute to hospitals and pharmacies, 
they are our coworkers, friends, neighbors, and family members.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I have visited the State to hear firsthand about the 
challenges of opioid abuse and how Cardinal Health can play a 
constructive role in addressing these challenges.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;To the people of West Virginia, I want to express my 
personal regret for judgments that we'd make differently today 
with regard to two pharmacies that have been a particular focus 
of this subcommittee. With the benefit of hindsight, I wish we 
had moved faster and asked a different set of questions. I'm 
deeply sorry that we did not.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Today I'm confident that we would reach different 
conclusions about opioid orders from those two pharmacies. 
We've taken responsibility with our regulators. Cardinal Health 
has not distributed oxycodone or hydrocodone to either of these 
two pharmacies for years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;We understand that no antidiversion program is perfect, 
which is why we are so focused on continuous improvement. We 
are at the table focused on alleviating this critical national 
health problem. We are committed to working with Congress, 
regulators, and others in the healthcare system to combat this 
crisis and address its effects.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;There is no single root cause of the crisis, and addressing 
it requires that all healthcare participants work together, and 
we have to do it now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;We recognize the challenge posed by lawful yet high-volume 
prescribing of opioids. On the one hand, we know there are many 
individuals who rely on these medications to address suffering 
associated with terminal illnesses, painful neurological 
conditions, severe injuries, and other medical conditions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;On the other hand, we share the recent judgments of 
policymakers, including senior leadership at HHS, the FDA, the 
surgeon general, the CDC, and others, that there have been too 
many prescriptions for too many pills.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;As a pharmaceutical wholesale distributor, we have a dual 
responsibility: to ensure that prescription medications are 
available for healthcare providers and their patients when 
needed while working to limit the potential for those 
prescription medicines to fall into the wrong hands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Pharmaceutical wholesale distributors do not and should not 
have visibility into the medical judgment or the patients for 
whom prescriptions are written. However, we can play a role by 
raising awareness of the dangers of overprescribing, which we 
are doing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Our antidiversion tools are built around a core commitment 
to spot, stop, and report potential diversion. Our program is 
supported by a dedicated antidiversion team of investigators, 
auditors, analysts, former law enforcement officers, compliance 
officers, and pharmacists deployed nationwide and augmented by 
substantial external resources and technology.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;From 2008 to the present, we have stopped suspicious orders 
for the shipment of hundreds of millions of opioids. We will 
not ship an order for hydrocodone or oxycodone to pharmacies 
that do not meet our standards. We have refused to onboard 
pharmacies that cannot pass our rigorous screening, and we have 
cut off existing customers that do not have effective controls.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;But with a problem as large and complex as opioid 
addiction, we know there is always room to do better, and we 
will never stop working to continuously improve and refine our 
systems.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;For over a decade, we have funded education and prevention 
programs that have been used in every State and more than 100 
colleges and pharmacies. We have also launched an opioid action 
program including the free distribution of opioid reversal 
medication to law enforcement and first responders beginning in 
four of the Nation's hardest-hit States across Appalachia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;As I indicated earlier, Cardinal Health is at the table and 
intends to be here for as long as the problem persists. Today 
I'll do my best to answer your specific questions and hope that 
our dialogue will continue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="STEVEN H. COLLIS"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Walden,
Subcommittee Chairman Harper, Ranking Member Pallone, Ranking 
Member DeGette, and distinguished members of the committee. On 
behalf of AmerisourceBergen's over 21,000 associates, thank you 
for the opportunity to be here today. We are committed to 
working with you and all stakeholders to help combat the tragic 
opioid abuse epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;I will begin today by sharing three distinct perspectives 
that have shaped my thinking on this urgent issue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;First, like so many others, I have been touched and 
saddened by the excruciating stories that demonstrate the 
destruction wrought by the disease of addiction, many shared by 
your colleagues as they relayed the devastation that opioids 
have left in their States. Some time ago, a Member shared a 
story of a mother who overdosed, leaving her two children 
starving and unattended for several days. Stories like this, 
and sadly so many that tell similar tragic tales, are always on 
my mind.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Second, I have seen friends, family, and those in my 
community fight through uncontrolled pain and have experienced 
firsthand the sad necessity of pain medications. This topic is 
frequently brought up in my conversations with doctors and 
healthcare professionals and was the focus of a recent 
discussion I had with the CEO of a world-class cancer treatment 
center in which he articulated his concern that the reaction to 
the opioid crisis would prevent his team from providing 
necessary and appropriate end-of-life care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Lastly, I have spent the majority of my 30-plus-year career 
in healthcare providing services surrounding the pharmaceutical 
industry with a focus on working to enable patient access to 
the medications they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;As you all know, AmerisourceBergen's role in regard to 
prescription opioid medications is one of a logistics provider 
and distributor. We are responsible for getting FDA-approved 
drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers to DEA-registered 
pharmacies that dispense them based on prescriptions by 
licensed healthcare providers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;We have no ability and no desire to encourage the 
prescribing or dispensing of pain medication. We do not 
manufacture or promote the prescribing of these medications. 
And we are not qualified to interfere with the very personal 
clinical decisions made between patients and their physicians.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Here are some things that AmerisourceBergen does do. For 
more than a decade, we've reported every opioid order we 
distribute on a daily basis to the DEA. So every order, every 
shipment, every day. We use statistical-based algorithms and 
data analytics tools to monitor and assess every order we 
receive in an effort to identify, stop, and report suspicious 
orders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Just as importantly, we continuously focus on enhancing our 
diversion control efforts. And our best-in-class diversion-
control team endeavors to track patterns and behaviors beyond 
just individual suspicious orders that have led us to refuse 
service or terminate service to pharmacies we've identified as 
problematic, including several of the pharmacies we have all 
heard about today in West Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;And we collaborate with and support others who are also 
working hard to address the crisis, partnering with others 
across the country to provide drug deactivation and disposal 
resources, and with our customers, not-for-profits, and 
innovators to support take-back programs and advance ideas that 
could help combat the opioid abuse epidemic.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;We believe we've taken meaningful action, but this epidemic 
cannot be solved unless we improve the ways we work together. 
Communication and technology between the DEA and pharmaceutical 
distributors should be enhanced. Specifically, the sharing of 
the DEA's comprehensive data of all opioid sales to all 
pharmacies on a de-identified basis would alert distributors if 
pharmacies are receiving controlled substances from other DEA 
registrants.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Beyond improved data sharing, additional DEA guidelines for 
distributors with uniform standards for suspicious ordering 
monitoring programs would create a more consistent approach 
across the more than 900 registered distributors in the 
industry and, in turn, more actionable input for law 
enforcement professionals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;We also support a number of solutions that are not specific 
to distributors, including revising prescriber guidelines, 
mandatory e-prescribing for controlled substances, enhanced 
prescription drug monitoring programs to enable physicians and 
regulators to determine if patients are obtaining prescriptions 
in more than one State, and a number of the proposals the 
subcommittee considered just last week.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Our work to play a role in combating abuse while supporting 
clinically appropriate access will never be complete. We always 
strive to be better. I join you today with an open mind and a 
sincere desire for additional guidance and ideas from this 
committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

And with that idea from his own father, my father founded H.D. 
Smith in Springfield, Illinois, in 1954, because he saw that 
there was a true need for a wholesale drug distributor that 
would commit to serving small town and rural independently 
owned mom-and-pop pharmacies and downstate hospitals as there 
was no other wholesale drug distributor like that in 
Springfield.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;My father's vision in starting the company was to make 
certain that a wholesale drug distributor would not only commit 
to serving these underserved communities, but he did so with 
the mission that patient care should never be disrupted because 
a rural small town pharmacy, hospital, or later, inner-city 
pharmacy, could not quickly and reliably supply the medicines 
that the patients in these communities needed right when they 
needed them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;This is the mission and vision he taught to me and my 
brother as we later joined the company and rose through its 
ranks over time. As a child, I sometimes accompanied my father 
when he, himself, would make emergency deliveries at night or 
over weekends. And as an employee of H.D. Smith, I did the same 
as well, along with many others. That is and always was our 
legacy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I first began working for H.D. Smith full-time in 1980 as a 
buyer and gradually moved my way up through the ranks over the 
years. In September 2007, I was appointed president and COO. In 
March 2015, I became president and CEO.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;In January 2018, H.D. Smith was acquired by 
AmerisourceBergen, and I no longer hold any office, position, 
or employment with H.D. Smith.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;But it is important to remember that since its founding in 
1954 until its acquisition in 2018, H.D. Smith always remained 
a family-owned business, which I am very proud to have served. 
I am certain, absolutely certain, that H.D. Smith's new 
management will observe my family's guiding principles just as 
loyally as I tried so hard to do myself.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I share the committee's grave concern about the opioid 
crisis and am committed to doing all we can to address it. We 
always took seriously our responsibilities to distribute 
controlled substances appropriately. We had a DEA license. We 
sold only to DEA- and State-licensed pharmacies and hospitals. 
We followed DEA regulations in handling controlled substances. 
We reported all our purchases and sales of controlled 
substances to the DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;My company distributed all kinds of pharmaceutical 
products. Only a small percentage were controlled substances, 
including pain medication. We didn't advertise or promote the 
medication or do anything else to encourage doctors to 
prescribe them or pharmacies to dispense them. Our job as a 
distributor was to fill orders that pharmacies sent us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;In fact, as a distributor, we could only see part of the 
distribution chain--the pharmacy that we supply. We didn't see 
the prescriptions the pharmacy filled or know the doctors who 
wrote them or have any contact with knowledge of the patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;As a distributor, we had to manage to the twin imperatives 
of ensuring that we distributed pharmaceuticals appropriately, 
for legitimate purposes, and ensuring the pharmacies that they 
had the products they needed when the patient arrived with a 
prescription so as to ensure undisrupted patient care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;To meet this challenge, we created strong diversion control 
systems and continually improved them overtime. We always did 
our very best to make sure that all orders we shipped went to 
pharmacies that dispensed medications only on legitimate 
prescriptions for legitimate medical reasons.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I am certain AmerisourceBergen will continue my company's 
proud tradition and do everything that can be done to help with 
the solutions to the opioid crisis in this country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

questions, and I will recognize myself first for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I want to thank you all for participating in today's very 
important hearing. As the subcommittee closely examines this 
very serious opioid crisis, I think it would be helpful at the 
outset to help establish a baseline of understanding. And I 
would like for each of you to answer each question that I am 
going to ask now.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    First, do you believe that the actions that you or your 
company took contributed to the opioid epidemic?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; We're really looking here, because I've got a
lot of questions, ``yes'' or ``no.'' And if it is not either 
one----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; No. No, sir, I do not believe that we
contributed to the opioid crisis.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;We'll come back to you then.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Dr. Mastandrea.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Mr. Hammergren.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; No.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Mr. Smith.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; I believe H.D. Smith conducted itself
responsibly and discharged its obligations.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Is that a no?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; That is a no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; No. I believe we--it's a no for
AmerisourceBergen.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Do you acknowledge--another question for each
of you--do you acknowledge that your company had past failings 
in maintaining effective controls to prevent the diversion of 
opioids?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I believe that our organization understood the
responsibilities and conducted them as best they could with the 
understanding at that time. I have no reason to challenge the 
good faith of the decisions made by people many years ago. But 
I can say that the decisions, as I mentioned in my commentary 
today, that we might have made on some of those pharmacies 
would look differently today.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Is that a no?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    My question was, do you acknowledge that your company had 
past failings in maintaining effective controls to prevent the 
diversion of opioids?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I think our organization understood its
obligations. We did resolve with regulators where we had areas 
where we thought we could have done better, and I think those 
resolutions satisfied the right balance of serving patients and 
satisfying those controls, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; So is that a yes, it's now a no? I'm trying--I
mean, I'm a little----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I am looking back on history. And what I'm
describing is an organization that I believe did its job at the 
time understanding its responsibilities to address the 
responsibilities of controlled drugs.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Dr. Mastandrea, the question is, do you
acknowledge that your company had past failings in maintaining 
effective controls to prevent the diversion of opioids?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Mr. Hammergren.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Our organization has worked for decades to
try to meet our obligations under the DEA regulations. And we 
continue to work today to evolve our processes to understand 
what they're asking us to do and make sure that we have state-
of-the-art capabilities in place.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; It seems like a pretty simple question. Do you
acknowledge that your company had past failings in maintaining 
effective controls to prevent the diversion of opioids?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; In the past we've had challenges
understanding the expectations that our regulator would like us 
to follow.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Mr. Smith.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; Again, I believe H.D. Smith has acted
responsibly. So the answer would be no.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Mr. Collis.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; I believe we've always discharged our duties
effectively and responsibly and have maintained an adequate 
diversion program.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The number of opioids shipped to pharmacies in
small towns of West Virginia has been astonishing: nearly 800 
million opioids in total distributed to West Virginia in just a 
5-year period, 20.8 million opioids to Williamson, and nearly 
17 million opioids to a single pharmacy in Mount Gay-Shamrock 
over a decade, 9 million opioids in just 2 years to Kermit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Do the extraordinary volume of opioid shipments to 
pharmacies in small towns of West Virginia indicate a breakdown 
in the suspicious order monitoring system?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mr. Chairman, it is a very important question.
I don't believe that the volume in relation to the size of the 
population is a determining factor. We often know that there's 
a small population, a town, which serves a large service area 
that may have a medical center or a cancer institute in the 
nearby area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    I have said, and I said in my statements, and I repeat 
here, that I think some of the decisions on particular 
pharmacies in West Virginia, knowing what we know today, we 
would have made different decisions, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Dr. Mastandrea.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Mr. Hammergren.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;We had a pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia,
called Sav-Rite that we actually terminated in that period of 
time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;    What I can say is that, knowing what we know today, in 
hindsight, we wish we would have terminated that relationship 
sooner.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Mr. Smith.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; Can you repeat the question?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The question is, do the extraordinary volume of
opioid shipments to pharmacies in small towns of West Virginia 
indicate a breakdown in the suspicious order monitoring system?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; I don't believe we had a breakdown in our
system.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Mr. Collis.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; If you're talking specifically about
AmerisourceBergen, we didn't ship to any of those pharmacies. 
If you're talking about the industry, I believe it probably 
did.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;My time has expired.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the ranking member of the 
subcommittee, Ms. DeGette, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Gentlemen, each of you in your own way spent time very 
carefully telling this committee what your companies do not do 
in terms of prescribing or things like that. But in fact each 
of your companies, under the Controlled Substances Act, has a 
duty to make sure that that controlled substances are 
distributed correctly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Would you agree with that statement, Mr. Barrett, yes or 
no?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Yes, we do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;And, Dr. Mastandrea.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Mr. Hammergren.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We have a duty to support----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; ``Yes'' or ``no'' will work.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We have a duty to support the----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; You have a duty to make sure that controlled
substances are distributed appropriately, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We have a responsibility to----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; Yes, we have a responsibility.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Mr. Collis.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; Yes, we have a responsibility.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;And in fact I would direct your gentlemen's
attention to exhibit 59 in the binder, which was a letter dated 
September 27, 2006, which was sent to every commercial entity 
in the United States registered with the DEA to distribute 
controlled substances.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;And on page 3 of that letter, it lists an entire panoply of 
things that your companies are supposed to do. The letter was 
then followed up on two times in 2007.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;I want to start with you, Dr. Mastandrea, and I want to ask 
you, Federal regulations require you to design and operate a 
system to disclose Federal operators from pharmacies. Is that 
correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. I'm sorry. I really don't understand----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Federal regulations require you to design and
operate a system to disclose suspicious orders from pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes, I believe that to be correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Yes, they do. OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;And according to--and I want to focus a little bit on 
Kermit, which is a town of 600--I'm sorry, 400.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;According to data that Miami-Luken provided to the 
committee, in 2007 your company supplied Sav-Rite pharmacy in 
Kermit with nearly 1.5 doses of opioids. Is that correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. I believe so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;In 2008 your company supplied Sav-Rite with
nearly 2 million doses of opioids. Is that correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. It's my understanding that is correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;And then in 2009 you supplied Sav-Rite with
another 800,000 pills. Is that correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. I believe so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Now, in fact you continued supplying Sav-Rite
until 2011 even though the pharmacy was actually raided by 
Federal authorities in early 2009. Is that correct?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. I believe so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Now, Dr. Mastandrea, we asked Miami-Luken to
provide us with its entire due diligence file on the Sav-Rite 
pharmacy, and this is what we got from you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Do you recognize these documents?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. No.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;OK. We can have somebody hand them to you, but
I will assure you it's about 15 pages of purchase orders and 
sales orders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Do you think this is a sufficient due diligence file for 
all of the number of opioids that you were sending to this one 
Sav-Rite pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. No.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;OK. Thank you. And you know what, thank you
for your honesty today. I appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    I want to ask you now, Mr. Hammergren, a question. Now, in 
2006, McKesson supplied Sav-Rite pharmacy with nearly 2.3 
opioid pills, which is more than 190,000 a month. Is that 
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I believe so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; And in 2007, McKesson again supplied Sav-Rite
with over 2.6 million opioid pills, or more than 222,000 pills 
per month. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I believe so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;Now, in your written testimony, Mr.
Hammergren, you put a lot of thought into using population 
statistics and other arguments to justify your shipments to 
Sav-Rite and other pharmacies. We just heard Mr. Barrett 
talking about that, too. But when the committee asked you to 
provide McKesson's due diligence file for Sav-Rite, you gave us 
a single document from 2007.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Do you recognize this document, sir?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; No, I don't.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;OK. It's exhibit 3 in the binder.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Do you recognize that document now? You don't.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; This is first time I've seen this document.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;OK. Well, I will tell you for the record that
this document, which says, ``Declaration of Controlled 
Substances Purchases,'' which is a two-page document, is the 
only documentation that McKesson gave to this committee when we 
asked for the due diligence file for Sav-Rite.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Do you think that this fulfills the requirements of the DEA 
that your company do due diligence for distribution of opioids 
to this city?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I believe our relationship with Sav-Rite
should have been terminated immediately.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Yes or no, do you think this is sufficient
documentation to show compliance with the rules of the DEA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We continue to evolve our diligence----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; ``Yes'' or ``no'' will work, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I've not reviewed the document. I can't
provide an answer to that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;OK. Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; At this time, the Chair will recognize Chairman
Walden, chair of the full Committee for Energy and Commerce, 
for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;And I appreciated the opportunity I had yesterday to meet 
with several of you and talk about how we work together going 
forward as a country to prevent this kind of disaster from 
continuing or ever happening again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Mr. Hammergren, between 2006 and 2007 McKesson supplied 
Sav-Rite pharmacy in Kermit, as you've heard, a town of 400, 
5.6 million opioids. Our research has indicated this pharmacy 
was fueled by prescriptions from a pill mill. This was widely 
known in the community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;In fact, our investigators have uncovered that the pill 
mill was widely known, and there were reports even in the media 
over years that indicated customers were selling pills in the 
parking lot, and that the cash drawer was so full it could not 
be shut.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Now, McKesson started a program in 2007, I think you called 
it the Lifestyle Drug Monitoring Program, under which McKesson 
reviewed every single customer for high-volume orders for 
certain drugs. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Including hydrocodone and oxycodone. I think we
referenced that in tab 1 in the binder.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    So the initial threshold, as I understand it, set by 
McKesson was 8,000 pills a month. The document indicates that 
you picked that number as a reasonable monthly threshold, 
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; And so do you know the average number of
hydrocodone dosage units or pills McKesson distributed to that 
Sav-Rite pharmacy that you terminated a relationship with back 
in 2007?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I do not.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;So we did some research. It appears it's 9,650
pills a day, which averages to 289,500 hydrocodone pills in a 
30-day month, which is more than 36 times the initial monthly 
threshold set by the program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;The program required distribution centers to review any 
order in excess of the threshold and document why orders above 
the threshold were shipped.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Now, according to a document produced by McKesson, all 
customers had been reviewed by June 12, 2007. This clearly 
should have identified Sav-Rite, considering your own 
distribution was 36 times higher than the threshold you set. I 
think that document's in tab 2.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    So did this program identify the Sav-Rite pharmacy?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; It did not, sir. It should have been
terminated sooner.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; And if so, on what basis did McKesson decide to
continue supplying hydrocodone far above your own threshold? 
This is what we're trying to figure out.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Our systems at the time were not automated
enough, certainly, and we didn't flag it fast enough and get it 
fast enough.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; So are there any documents justifying the
continued distribution to Sav-Rite?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I don't know, sir. But, as I've testified,
we terminated that relationship as soon as we became aware that 
the purchases were as you described.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;In your testimony you note that the large
distribution figures highlighted by the press in this 
investigation reflect a volume of opioid orders ``not 
inconsistent'' with the rate at which opioids were prescribed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    If this is the case and 9,600 pills a day distributed by 
McKesson to Sav-Rite in 2007 is reasonable, then why set the 
initial monthly limit at 8,000 per month? Or is this something 
you just--the system did not catch?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We did not properly manage that Sav-Rite
relationship and certainly didn't do it soon enough.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; I see. So what we're trying to figure out is,
are there other Sav-Rites out there today? And this would apply 
to everybody on the panel. What is it in the systems you have 
or the DEA have that allowed this to happen then, and are they 
in place today to prevent this from happening? How do we shut 
down these pill mills?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;We certainly learned, Mr. Chairman, from
that experience at Sav-Rite, and we realized that we needed 
automated systems that don't allow any order to ship out of our 
facilities that are past those thresholds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;So today Sav-Rite pharmacy wouldn't get a single order from 
McKesson. Our systems block those orders as they're inbound. 
And if they want to have that order shipped, we have to go out 
and do an investigation at that pharmacy to justify any 
increase.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;    So if they open--if a pharmacy somewhere was going to open 
a new relationship with a hospice, our people would go out and 
view that and understand whether that is a legitimate business 
reason, exactly for your purpose.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt; And are your systems in place today that would
identify an overprescribing physician or facility that is 
driving too many pills? How does that work?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;That's one of the challenges, frankly, with
the systems that McKesson has. We don't see the prescribing 
systems that are reported out of the pharmacy. So the way we 
have to manage it is to determine a suspicious order based 
primarily on quantities compared to average pharmacies that are 
similar.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;    And clearly, the challenge in that is that suspicious is 
really an isolated individual customer-by-customer evaluation 
that isn't informed by the physician population, the 
prescribing habits, et cetera.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walden&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;Unfortunately, my time has expired. I'm sure
we'll have questions for the record. I'd appreciate the 
feedback from all of you on that topic, because we're trying to 
find solutions here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Walden"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you, Chairman Walden.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the ranking member of the full 
committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I'm trying to run through this quickly, so I may have to 
try to have you summarize.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;This committee's investigation has uncovered a number of 
shortcomings in the way that some distributors handled the 
distribution of opioids as this horrible epidemic unfolded. But 
what I really want to know is, moving forward, how do we ensure 
that adequate systems are in place to detect the kinds of 
problems that have clearly led to the oversupply and diversion 
problems we've seen in West Virginia?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;For example, in Kermit, population 400, several 
distributors each sent millions of pills to a single pharmacy, 
and it's hard to understand why certain distributors didn't 
have systems to flag and prevent some of these shipments.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Another example, Miami-Luken alone sent almost 1.5 million 
pills to Sav-Rite in 2007 and almost 2 million pills in 2008, 
and on its face these levels seem ridiculous. At the end of the 
day, this pharmacy was raided and its owner was sentenced to 
prison.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;So let me start with Dr. Mastandrea.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Have you made changes to your system to compare the number 
of pills you send a pharmacy against the population of that 
region to catch something like this before it gets out of 
control? Quickly, because I have more questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Dr. Mastandrea. Thank you, Congressman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Yes, we have made changes. We've made significant changes. 
We have a full-time compliance officer that monitors all--we're 
not that big, so it's not that hard to monitor our opioid 
distribution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    We have purchased a commercial algorithm-based system that 
stops the suspicious order in real time, is reported to the DEA 
in real time. We have site visits. We have an investigator that 
makes site visits. We review the accuracy and timeliness----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;I'm going to have to cut you off, only because
I want to ask Mr. Barrett a question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Cardinal provided two pharmacies, Hurley Drug and Family 
Discount, which filled prescriptions for Dr. Katherine Hoover, 
and her clinic was widely known as the pill mill and Federal 
authorities closed it in 2010. Dr. Hoover was the number one 
prescriber in the entire State, yet she seemed to be able to 
write scripts for local pharmacies for years before her clinic 
was shut down.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;One of your fellow distributors reported that Dr. Hoover 
alone was responsible at one time for 69 percent of the 
hydrocodone prescriptions at Hurley Drugstore in Williamson and 
more than half of the hydrocodone prescriptions at Family 
Discount.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    So, Mr. Barrett, are there lessons that you believe can be 
taken from what happened with Dr. Hoover that will change how 
you conduct due diligence going forward?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Ranking Member Pallone, thank you. And the
answer is yes, I think we would do things very differently 
today. That kind of order volume would have been picked up and 
stopped just statistically by our algorithms.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I think the subjectivity of judgment of whether a pharmacy 
is legitimate or not legitimate today is really not the 
question. We look at data, and if the data tells us there is an 
aberrant pattern, we simply stop.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    In this case, as it turned out, there was a bad actor in 
the area, a doctor, which we later found out, which is why we 
shopped shipment. But today's systems would simply stop that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;All right. Let me go to McKesson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;McKesson has reached two settlements with DOJ about alleged 
failures to monitor for suspicious orders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    So, Mr. Hammergren, how will it be different this time? 
What serious changes have you made to your systems to flag 
suspicious orders?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;We certainly have learned lessons from our
experience in the past. And our systems today are automated and 
not subjective. As Mr. Barrett just said, we shut those orders 
off inbound in the door.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;We also have hired very experienced, DEA experienced people 
to come out and help us investigate facilities before we bring 
them online and to make sure that we've not brought a bad actor 
on at any point in the process.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;I think the thing that would continue to help us is if we 
can put physicians in a place where they have more information 
when they're prescribing, and certainly at the pharmacy level 
help the pharmacies understand red flags of patients that may 
be getting multiple doses in different directions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;    So I think there's more that we can do as an industry. 
Blocking the orders is certainly important, but you can imagine 
every time we block an order, there are legitimate patients in 
some of those pharmacies looking for their medications. So it's 
a little bit of a blunt force.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Last question, going back to Mr. Barrett.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    Cardinal also reached two settlements with DOJ over these 
same issues, and it's only fair I ask you the same question. 
How will this time be different? How can you assure us that 
you've addressed the issues raised in the settlement 
agreements? What specific enhancements have you made to your 
system?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;The settlement in 2008 reflected the rising of what was 
internet pharmacy. Our organization I think was doing what it 
thought was right to adapt to that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;At the same time, we saw emergence over the next few years 
of pain clinics, many of which were legitimate, by the way, but 
as it turns out some were not.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    And I think we had to learn during that process of the 
shift of this crisis. I think we've learned that and our 
systems today reflect that learning.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Pallone&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Pallone"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair will now recognize Mr. Barton for 5
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;And thank each of you for attending voluntarily. We didn't 
have to subpoena you. We appreciate that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;And, Mr. Collis, I understand that you forego back surgery 
to appear today, so we really appreciate you. I noticed you 
stood up a little bit ago and walked. Dr. Burgess will 
prescribe an opioid if you don't make it through the hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;This is an unusual hearing because each of you provides a 
much-needed list of products that are legal, and all of you 
represent corporations that have generally had a very positive 
record in your industry. And yet, we have a huge problem, 115 
people a day are dying of opioid overdoses, and most of those 
are from legally prescribed opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;I'm an industrial engineer. I'm kind of a simplistic 
person. Our system that we're looking at starts with the 
patient and the doctor relationship. The doctor prescribes an 
opioid. It's sent to a pharmacy. The pharmacy accumulates 
orders and sends to a wholesale distributor, which is one of 
your companies in most cases. You get your drugs from a 
manufacturer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;The whole system is overseen by the DEA and is a part of a 
culture which has evolved that pain is something that should be 
addressed in any way possible. And at the time the epidemic 
really took off, there wasn't a huge public outcry over opioid 
prescriptions. It's different today. The culture today is 
looking at the problem differently than it did 10 years ago or 
15 years ago.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;My first question, since you folks are part of the legal 
distribution system, is the overuse of legal opioids a solvable 
problem, yes or no? Legal opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Let's start with the gentleman down at the end and work our 
way down.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Yes, Congressman. Thank you for the question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    I think the practice of medicine is evolving, and I think 
that we know more than we did today. And I think, in fact, the 
prescribing of legal opioids, high-potency opioids, is 
declining.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; I really just need----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I think the answer is yes, it can be solved.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Yes or no?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Yes, better informed physicians will solve
the problem, I think.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Mr. Smith.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; The use of drugs always come with a risk-return
tradeoff. So I think there will always be some risk-return 
tradeoff to this category of drugs and any other. So I'm not 
exactly sure what you mean by solve.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Well, I think ``solve'' is a pretty common
term.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; But I think we can greatly improve the
situation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; You know, fixed.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; I think that we can bring it back into much more
acceptable levels.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; I've got a minute and a half left.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; There are already significant changes in
prescription trends for legal opioids, but I think it can be 
vastly improved. I don't know if completely solved.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Generically, everybody said yes, with some
modification. I think it can be, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Now, this is a little bit trickier question. What percent 
responsibility do you believe your part of the chain of the 
industry have in solving the problem, from zero percent, we 
have no responsibility, to 100 percent, it's all our 
responsibility?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;You just all said that it is solvable. Now, what percent of 
responsibility do you think the distribution, wholesale 
distribution system has in solving the problem?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Again, we'll just start at one end and go to the other.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Congressman, I don't feel qualified to give a
percentage of responsibility. I think all of us in the 
healthcare system have to work together to address this, and I 
think we should.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; Do you agree that you have some responsibility?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I believe that we've got a role in an
integrated healthcare system.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;So you have some responsibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Congressman, I believe that it's a shared 
responsibility among many different players, physicians, 
pharmacists, State medical boards, State pharmacy boards, DEA.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;But you agree you have some responsibility?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. I have said that, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Your company, your industry, not you
personally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. The percentage is shared.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We have a role to play, Congressman,
certainly. And in your example, one of the most important roles 
we play is to make sure we find suspicious customers and 
suspicious orders and cut off the supply to those customers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt; My time has expired, but I'll let each of you
two.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; Well, I would just say that H.D. Smith had its
role as a distributor to play and did so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; I get the benefit of going last, so I just
would say it's very difficult to ascribe a percentage, given 
the shared responsibility.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barton&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;Well, I think you do have a responsibility, I
think it's a significant responsibility, but I don't think you 
have a majority of the responsibility. And hopefully, by the 
time we end these hearings, we'll get all the players in here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Barton"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from
Florida, Ms. Castor, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;This committee's investigation has made plain that drug 
wholesale distributors flooded areas of West Virginia and other 
parts of the country with massive amounts of opioids. This has 
fed into the public health epidemic that is costing us at least 
$8 billion per year nationwide and costing lives, 116 deaths 
every day. We focused on West Virginia because it has the 
highest opioid death rate in the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Mr. Barrett, your company Cardinal shipped 1.5 million 
opioid pills each year from 2009 to 2011 to a single pharmacy, 
Family Discount, in the small town of Mount Gay. That is an 
average of about 4,000 pills per day.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;At the subcommittee's March 20 hearing, DEA testified that 
that amount shipped to that single pharmacy was, indeed, 
excessive. And this was after Cardinal had been sanctioned by 
the DOJ through a settlement agreement for not following the 
law.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    Mr. Barrett, you've said that the wholesalers don't control 
demand, but clearly you have a responsibility under the law to 
highlight and flag these suspicious orders. How did Cardinal 
estimate what was appropriate for a given pharmacy?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Congresswoman, thank you for your question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I think our organization recognizes it as a dual 
responsibility. One is to provide medicine to a system 
requiring it as prescribed, and the other is to do what we can 
to prevent those from falling in the wrong hands.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    We've evolved over the years. We've become more attuned to 
the changes. I think today----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;But this kept happening even after DOJ had
warned you and you had accepted responsibility and said you 
would do a better job.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;In more recent years, this pharmacy's total purchases of 
these drugs declined dramatically. In 2015 and 2016, it was 
down to about 500,000 pills. And that wasn't just from 
Cardinal, that was from everyone, from all distributors. That 
was but a fraction of what Cardinal alone had shipped them in 
earlier years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    So isn't this a clear reflection that that was not the 
medical need in the community? The amount being shipped didn't 
reflect what could have been appropriately used in rural West 
Virginia, especially after DOJ had already warned you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Congresswoman, let me make two points about
that, if I may.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;One is, I've acknowledged earlier that I had wished that we 
had moved earlier to stop shipping to that pharmacy, which we 
have many years ago.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Second, I think the evolution was of our looking at a 
system that was focused on the legitimacy of a pharmacy--which, 
by the way, is still in business--and the awareness of 
something happening in the system, which was a bad doctor. And 
we should have moved more quickly on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;I'd now like to turn to McKesson.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Mr. Hammergren, your company McKesson distributed over 1.8 
million opioid pills each year in 2006 and 2007 to Family 
Discount Pharmacy. That's an average of about 5,000 pills per 
day in this rural small town. Based upon a figure cited by DEA, 
McKesson shipped Family Discount roughly six times the amount 
of hydrocodone that an average pharmacy in rural West Virginia 
would have received during those years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    So a similar question to you. McKesson delivered millions 
of pills to the single pharmacy. Clearly, that's not reasonable 
and you should have flagged that and stopped that right away. 
Why didn't you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We did terminate the relationship with that
pharmacy. And like Mr. Barrett, I would have liked us to have 
made a decision faster. That's the answer. We caught a bad 
pharmacy and shut it down.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;And as I mentioned, this pharmacy's total
purchases of oxycodone and hydrocodone dropped dramatically, 
but that wasn't until 2015, 2016. And that means the amount of 
opioids your company alone shipped back in 2006 was over three 
times as much as the pharmacy got from all distributors in 
2016.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    Now, you in your testimony, you pointed to, well, 
overprescribing by doctors, maybe the DEA should have done 
more, pharmacy bad actors. But you can't reasonably claim that 
this pharmacy's dispensing filled the medical need. I mean, it 
took you years to respond. Why was that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I can't comment on the medical need,
Congresswoman. What I can say is that today in our systems, any 
shipment that was outside those boundaries would never have 
happened. It would have been shut down and reported 
immediately.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; Why didn't you address--given that this
community was ravaged by opioid deaths and addiction, and the 
town of Williamson was even nicknamed Pilliamson, don't you 
take responsibility for what was happening back then? Was it 
the profit motive simply overcame the--you saw that paying the 
penalties under settlement agreements was a cost worth paying 
because you were making so much money?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congresswoman, we take all of these matters
very seriously. Any settlement with a regulator we take very 
seriously. Our systems have evolved, and we continue to invest 
heavily to make sure that situations like that don't happen 
again.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;I think this was the opposite of due diligence
that was required under the law, and we're going to be looking 
for greater accountability.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    Thank you, and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair now recognizes the vice chairman of
the subcommittee, Mr. Griffith, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Mr. Hammergren, in the limited time I have, I'm going to 
ask you a series of yes/no questions. But first, as background, 
my district borders southern West Virginia. McKesson was a 
major supplier of pharmacies there, as were some of the others, 
distributing millions of pills, most into West Virginia in 
towns that were between 30 and 60 miles from my district.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;And last week, I was at an opioid conference, and look at 
this map that they gave us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;[Slide follows.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;That dark brown area are the deaths per
capita in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and you will note 
there's a correlation with the dark brown areas most common to 
the border with West Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;And so, gentlemen, when you say that, you know, you're not 
sure that you have a role--not all of you have said that--it 
flies in the face of that map and the people of my district.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;So, Mr. Hammergren, in May of 2008 McKesson Corporation and 
the Justice Department and DEA entered into a memorandum 
agreement, tab 4 in the binder there. You signed on behalf of 
McKesson Corporation on page 10 of the settlement and release 
agreement and page 7 of the settlement agreement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Do you recall signing the document, yes or no?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; The conduct at issue in this first settlement
with the DEA was that the DEA believed certain McKesson 
distribution centers did not report suspicious orders and did 
not have effective controls against diversion. Because of the 
serious commitments that McKesson made to the U.S. Government 
and the $13.25 million civil penalty--you recall that, don't 
you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I do.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Two months later, you presided over a July
23, 2008, board of directors meeting. And according to the 
board minutes at tab 12 in the binder, public policy issues 
were discussed affecting the corporation. In an accompanying 
slide at tab 13, DEA suspicious orders, defined as orders of 
unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal 
pattern, and orders of unusual frequency were categorized as 
high, in terms of the degree of political urgency, and impact 
to, and the level of engagement of the corporation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    The urgency of the DEA suspicious orders issue was tied to 
the May 2008 settlement, wasn't it, yes or no?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We certainly took the settlement,
Congressman, very seriously.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; The corporation's high level of engagement
meant McKesson management would put in a high level of effort 
to carry out the promises made in your 2008 memorandum of 
agreement. Isn't that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; It is correct that it was a top priority
for us.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; In your experience as an executive at
McKesson Corporation, when the company makes a legal 
commitment, especially one with a high level of engagement, the 
corporate leadership gives a directive and the appropriate 
personnel carry it out. Isn't that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; Yes, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, we took it very seriously.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;Yes. However, according to media reports,
from 2008 to 2013, the McKesson Aurora, Colorado, warehouse 
filled 1.6 million orders, but only reported 16 suspicious 
orders. The Landover, Maryland, warehouse, which supplied West 
Virginia, routinely failed to report and fulfilled suspicious 
orders placed by numerous pharmacies in West Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    While the Landover facility was closed in 2012, the serious 
lack of suspicious order reporting does not show a high level 
of engagement by McKesson, does it, yes or no?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We took our responsibilities very
seriously.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; Yes or no? Failing to live up to the 2008
agreement does not show a high level of commitment, does it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; That's not true. We had a high level of
commitment, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; And you failed. The DEA alleged that McKesson
distribution centers ignored thresholds and supplied pharmacies 
volumes of controlled substances that exceeded their assigned 
amount without a proper review. That also does not show a high 
level of engagement, does it, yes or no?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, we had a high level of
engagement.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; Were any McKesson personnel fired in
connection with any of the failures noted in the 2017 
memorandum of agreement? That's at tab 5.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, the people involved today in
the CSMP are vastly different than the people in 2008.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; Was anybody fired?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, the people are different
today. Many of them have left the corporation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; But they weren't fired.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We don't talk about specific----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; I'm not asking you to talk about specifics.
I'm asking you to tell me if anybody got fired. Did you hold 
anybody personally responsible for what was happening in West 
Virginia and in Colorado and other parts of the country?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, everybody at the company is
accountable to do what's right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;But no one was fired. All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;In January 2017, McKesson Corporation and the Justice 
Department and the DEA entered into another memorandum of 
agreement, because you didn't live up to 2008. As a result of 
this agreement, McKesson paid a record-setting $150 million 
fine.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;In this memorandum of agreement, in section 2, acceptance 
of responsibility, McKesson acknowledged it failed to identify 
or report to DEA certain orders by certain pharmacies which 
should have been detected by McKesson as suspicious. This 
involved 12 out of 30 McKesson distribution centers. More than 
a third of your distribution centers were involved in these 
failures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    That is a widespread systemic failure. Wouldn't you agree?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, our organization in 2008 was
working closely with the DEA.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt; This is 2017.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I understand. And we have created a program
that really we believe is meeting their needs, focused on 
suspicious customers and knowing our customers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;And a third of them were out of compliance.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Before I recognize the next person, Mr. Hammergren, it 
seems like a pretty easy question to answer if anyone was fired 
in response to Mr. Griffith's question. And the answer is yes, 
no, I don't know, or I refuse to answer. What is your answer?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Yes, people were fired as a result of this.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Hammergren.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    I'll now recognize the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. 
Schakowsky, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;I have to say that I'm pleased that you're
all with us today to discuss the role your companies played in 
supplying the opioid epidemic, but I have to also say that this 
reluctance even to answer that simple question, or reluctance, 
always qualifying your responsibility--clearly, you had a 
responsibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    And, Mr. Hammergren, you acknowledge that you wish you had 
terminated your relationship with Sav-Rite earlier and that you 
did end that relationship. But why did you then--why did you 
ship 5 million pills before you shut it down?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congresswoman, thank you for the question.
Certainly, we've learned from our experience during the 2006, 
2007, over a decade ago, and today's systems are much more 
robust than they were then. Our orders actually aren't even 
processed today if they're above thresholds. In those early 
phases of 12 years ago, our systems weren't as automated as 
they are today.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;You know, all of you, I hope, will
acknowledge that since 1971, your companies are required by 
Federal law to halt and report suspicious orders of 
prescription opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    Did you, before all of this broke, have a process to do 
that, if I could just go down, to obey the 1971 law?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Yes. Our organization, Congresswoman, has had
a clear sense of the Controlled Substance Act and reported all 
orders to the DEA of narcotics.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;Mr. Mastandrea?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes, we did have a system in place, 
Congresswoman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congresswoman, we also reported all orders
required.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; Mr. Smith.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; At different points in time, the expectations of
the DEA were different.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; Microphone, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;At different points in time, the expectations of
the DEA were different. Up till about 2007, the DEA expectation 
was for us to report suspicious orders after the fact with 
monthly reporting, and we did so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    It was in 2007 that the DEA expressed a very different 
expectation concerning controlled substance orders and that if 
it was suspicious they asked that we develop a system to hold 
those orders at the time they were received.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; OK, I'm going to move on.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; We implemented that system in 2008.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; Sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; Congresswoman, AmerisourceBergen didn't exist.
There were many predecessor companies. I'm not aware of any of 
them that weren't committed to compliance with all Federal 
statutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;I just think it's really important to put
on the record that this is not a new requirement, that yes, 
maybe there wasn't the kind of enforcement, but nonetheless, 
your companies had a responsibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;I also want not only to look back and see what went wrong, 
but also to look forward to see how to do better. And it is 
apparent now that pharmaceutical corporations are taking 
advantage of the opioid epidemic by spiking the price of life-
saving drugs like naloxone, and that that, in my view, is 
unacceptable. Pharmaceutical corporations can't start this 
epidemic with irresponsible and reckless on day--recklessness 
one day--and then turn around and profit the next.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    So I wanted to again ask Mr. Hammergren, McKesson 
distributes Evzio, which has raised its price from $690 to 
$4,500. So what does McKessonearn net per unit for Evzio?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I can't answer that question, Ms.
Congresswoman. I would say that we don't set the prices for 
branded drugs. Those are set by the manufacturers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; And how much does McKesson net annually for
the distribution of Evzio?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congresswoman, I don't have that
information. I'd be happy to get it for you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; McKesson also distributes Narcan. What does
McKesson earn net per unit for Narcan?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congresswoman, I don't know the answer to
that question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt; And how much does McKesson earn net
annually for its distribution of Narcan?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I don't know that question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Schakowsky&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;So I would expect that we'll put that in
writing and that we'd get this information. Because, you know, 
you can't have it both ways, fellas. You know, the opioid 
epidemic is there, and now for life-saving drugs those prices 
are going through the roof.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;And I yield back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"&gt;    Mr. Griffith [presiding]. I thank the gentlelady and now 
recognize the gentleman from Texas, Dr. Burgess.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Thank you, and thanks for having the hearing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Mr. Hammergren, let me just continue on that line for a 
moment, because I think this is an important point. You as a 
distributor do not set the list price of the compounds that you 
were being questioned about. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I don't believe so. If they're branded
patented drugs, we don't set the price.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; So you receive an order and you fill an order.
You're agnostic as far as the price. That is set by the person 
selling the product. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, the manufacturer sets those
prices, to the best of my understanding.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Mr. Collis, you mentioned--it was almost an
offhanded mention, but it is important--one of the first 
hearings that I sat through in this subcommittee in 2005 was a 
hearing on why don't doctors prescribe enough pain medicine. 
And you referenced that there are some people who are watching 
this debate who are concerned are they going to be able to get 
the medicines for the treatments for which they are being 
treated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And I think that is a legitimate concern and we do need to 
be mindful. We cannot overlook the fact that there are serious, 
serious problems that need to be fixed. But I thank you for 
bringing that up, because that is an important reference point 
that we sometimes overlook.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Mr. Smith, let me just ask you, we've actually heard some 
back-and-forth, and I think there was a question on the other 
side dealing with a document or a letter from Mr. Rannazzisi at 
the DEA, Drug Enforcement Administration, that said, don't just 
report to us the total sales.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Mr. Collis, I think you said, we just report, we're not 
making a judgment whether it's suspicious, this is what we 
deliver to place A, B, or C. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; We do report every day, and we also report on a
monthly basis all cost data, but we do make determinations of 
what is a suspicious order and we hold them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Sure, and I appreciate that. This is what is
so frustrating to me for an all-hands-on-deck situation. The 
DEA says, don't just report your raw data. But you have 
algorithms. The DEA should have algorithms. I think the Center 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services probably should have 
algorithms in their database so that they can identify who are 
the outliers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;Not saying that someone is doing something wrong, it may be 
a pain clinic, it may be a cancer clinic, but let's afford some 
extra scrutiny if this is the amount of product that's going 
out so we don't end up with a situation such as in Kermit.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Now, Mr. Smith, let me ask you, your company, and I think 
you testified to this, your company reports suspicious orders. 
What does the DEA do with that information when you report it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; I don't really know.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt; You've sold your company, I understand that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;But I don't really know. And the DEA, as we talk
about the DEA, the DEA has not been the same in their outlook, 
attitude, and interaction with the industry over my career. For 
most of my career, the interactions with the DEA were very 
collaborative and very purposeful, in terms of working with 
them to try to control controlled substance distribution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;Back about 10 years ago, with the advent of this 
expectation of holding orders, it became very, very difficult 
to interact with the DEA and to get feedback. They were, in 
fact, as evasive as possible in the midst of this crisis to us, 
in terms of giving us guidance. More recently, that attitude 
has been changing and improved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Now, as you point out, as of 2018, I was pretty much out of 
the picture. I can only hope that the DEA will continue to work 
collaboratively with the industry going forward.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Burgess&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;And what you have just related is information
that independently I and my staff have acquired, that the 
number of administrative actions against registrants by the 
DEA--now I'm merely talking about doctors, because that was my 
focus when I began this--but when you look at the numbers in 
the committee's memo, how things have just been going up 
through the roof, the number of administrative actions, I'm not 
talking about for West Virginia, I'm talking about for the 
whole country, 21 in 2014, at the same point that point in the 
graph was probably at its apex.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I've got to believe that the DEA--I'm not saying that 
everything that you've reported--I want you to do your job, but 
I want the DEA to do their job, and it doesn't look like they 
have been. And I'll just share with you, they've been very, 
very difficult to get information out of the agency.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I hope you're right, Mr. Smith, I hope it is changing. But 
we cannot fix this problem if the agency required to be in 
charge simply is insensitive to our requests for information.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;I thank all of you for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Burgess"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Griffith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;I thank the gentleman, and now recognize the
gentleman from New York, Mr. Tonko, for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Griffith"&gt;    I understand you have a UC request.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; I'll yield to Ms. Castor.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;I'd like to ask unanimous consent to submit for the record 
information relating to the salaries of the CEOs of the Big 
Three drug wholesalers, including the McKesson CEO, who made 
over $692 million in the 10 years leading up to 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;Mr. Harper [presiding]. Without objection, so ordered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt;    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Castor&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Ms. Castor"&gt; I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chair.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Mr. Barrett, I asked about Cardinal's sales to pharmacies 
that filled prescriptions written by two doctors, Katherine 
Hoover and Diane Shafer. Federal law enforcement put both of 
these doctors out of business around 2010.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Dr. Shafer was sentenced to 6 months in prison after she 
admitted to writing illegal opioid prescriptions. According to 
the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District 
of West Virginia, she wrote more prescriptions than entire 
hospitals did between 2003 and 2010.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Dr. Hoover was the single largest prescriber of controlled 
substances in West Virginia between 2002 and 2010. When her 
clinic was raided, she fled to the Bahamas.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Cardinal served two pharmacies, Hurley Drug and Family 
Discount, which filled prescriptions from Dr. Hoover. In 
September 2008, a Cardinal employee raised an alarm about 
Hurley Drug in a memo, which noted that Hurley filled 
prescriptions from Dr. Katherine Hoover even though other 
pharmacies refused to fill her prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;According to this document, another pharmacist stated that 
he would not fill Hoover's prescriptions because, quote, ``He 
had ridden by the office of Dr. Hoover and there are lines of 
people standing outside waiting to get into the office,'' close 
quote.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;In fact, according to a 2011 news report in the late 2000s, 
quote, ``Crowds of people filled the lot outside Dr. Hoover's 
clinic,'' and it was, in quote, ``an open secret that it was 
essentially a pill mill.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    Is that accurate? And did your employee observe the lines 
of people outside that office as early as 2008, which could 
indicate a possible pill mill?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Congressman, I've been briefed on those memos.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; Pardon me?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Yes, I've been briefed on that report.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;OK. So your employee's memo appears in
Cardinal's due diligence file for Hurley, but it is unclear 
what actions Cardinal took based on it. For example, Cardinal 
continued to supply Hurley for another 6 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    So why? Do you know whether Cardinal ever followed up on 
this memo?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;So we've not shipped that company high-potency
opioids for many years. I mentioned earlier that based on what 
I've seen, I wish we had taken action earlier. I think we had a 
system that allowed for too much subjectivity about the 
legitimacy of a pharmacy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Today's system simply would have taken the data, seen 
outlier data, and shut it off. And, as I said earlier, I've 
seen enough to know that I wish we would have acted earlier.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;Cardinal also supplied Family Discount Pharmacy,
sending it more than 5.5 million pills from 2009 to 2012, after 
which you ended your relationship with them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;According to a document in another distributor's files, in 
2009, 51 percent of Family Discount's hydrocodone prescriptions 
came from Dr. Hoover. That distributor also reported to the 
committee that Dr. Hoover was responsible for 69 percent of 
Hurley Drug's hydrocodone orders, which the distributor 
considered a, quote, ``cause of concern.''&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    Mr. Barrett, in your written testimony, you say you wish 
you had asked a different set of questions before distributing 
to this pharmacy. It appears that Cardinal may have missed the 
red flags connecting Dr. Hoover to both Hurley Drug and Family 
Discount. So I'd like to know how this will be fixed going 
forward.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Congressman, it is a great question. It is
fixed going forward. As I mentioned earlier, I think both of 
the pharmacies to which you referred were influenced by this 
same doctor who, as it turns out, was a bad doc.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Today's systems would not allow subjectivity. Today's 
systems would simply say, we set thresholds or limits, based on 
certain criteria, primarily relationship between controlled 
drugs and on other drugs and the nature of the community. And 
if it crossed those thresholds, we simply would shut the order 
down, and that's what we do today.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt; So is it your belief that these two situations
would have been caught much earlier?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; In today's system, absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Tonko&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;It's unbelievable that these numbers of pills
were being sold and that this pill mill was getting away with 
activity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;I just hope that all of the distributors before us have 
much more rigorous due diligence standards in place today that 
can help them spot these red flags.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Tonko"&gt;    And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The Chair will now recognize Mrs. Brooks for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Mr. Smith, I'd like to talk about Family Discount Pharmacy 
that has been mentioned here already. Your company terminated 
Family Discount Pharmacy's ability to purchase controlled 
substances in 2011. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I believe that we discontinued selling them
anything at that--around that time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Correct, in 2011. But prior to that, was H.D. 
Smith aware of the prescriber we've heard about, Dr. Katherine 
Hoover, who was responsible for providing over 262,000 
hydrocodone prescriptions to Family Discount Pharmacy as well 
as other nearby pharmacies in February of 2008? Was H.D. Smith 
aware of the Dr. Hoover problem?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I am not aware of the specific timing of when
our due diligence team became aware of that issue. I do know 
that with Family Discount that when we implemented our 
controlled substance ordering monitoring program, we began to 
limit the controlled substances that we sent and----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Excuse me. Did Dominic Grant work for you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I beg your pardon?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Did Dominic Grant for you? Did George Euson 
work for you?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;George Euson worked for me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. In 2008?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;Uh-huh.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Where I have an email indicating that Dr. 
Hoover had prescribed, had filled over 262,000.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. So I do believe that your director of 
corporate security was aware of that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. If you turn to tab 16 you'll see that over a 
year later H.D. Smith noted in a November 12, 2009, report--
2009--that Dr. Katherine Hoover was responsible for 51 percent 
of the hydrocodone scripts being filled by Family Discount.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Now, knowing that, was Family Discount Pharmacy--had that 
become a concern for your company in November of 2009?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;It appears that it was at that time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And did H.D. Smith report this to the DEA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I'm not sure what the timing of what we would
have reported to the DEA was.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. Well, in fact, we know that Family Discount 
did make some reports to the DEA between May of 2008 and May of 
2009, but not at this time, in November of 2009.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    In April of 2015 then, interestingly, did H.D. Smith--so 
you then terminated with Family Discount in 2011, but then, 
going to April of 2015, did H.D. Smith make the decision to 
resume its business relationship with Family Discount Pharmacy?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;That's possible. We have a robust program, and
that includes reviewing new data that comes along. It is 
possible that we could reopen an account if we saw that there 
were indications that the situation was different.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;On the other hand, that doesn't end our robust due 
diligence. We can continue to do that and can decide to close 
it again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Let's talk about the due diligence. Were you 
aware that Family Discount had been dropped by some of the 
other distributors here at the table when you renewed your 
relationship? Were you aware of that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;No, I was not aware.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. So please turn to tab 19, speaking of due 
diligence. An email was sent by an H.D. Smith employee in 
January of 2016 expressing concern that the company was 
providing controlled substances to Family Discount's other 
location, located just 3 miles away, despite the fact the 
company, your company, had never performed any new customer due 
diligence on that pharmacy. Were you aware of that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;No.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. The employee's email also noted that this 
pharmacy had reached its hydrocodone threshold only 12 days 
into a month. Were you aware of that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;No.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. And did you report the suspicious activity to 
DEA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I do not know.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. I would assume you did not.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Following the January 2016 correspondence, did either 
Family Discount location continue to place controlled substance 
orders that exceeded the monthly thresholds established by H.D. 
Smith, this new amazing system you put in place?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I do not know.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Well, you might want to take a look at emails 
in June and October of 2016 showing that Family Discount had 
placed orders in excess of established thresholds, that, in 
fact, one of your employees indicated that the justification 
was to meet our guideline to obtain our monthly discount. What 
monthly discount?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I'm not sure what that refers to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. A monthly discount with the manufacturer?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;No.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. Monthly discount--no idea what monthly--what 
deals were being cut?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I'm not sure what that refers to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Brooks. H.D. Smith then blocked Family--H.D. Smith 
block Family Discount's ability to purchase controlled 
substances on February 16 of 2018. Were you in charge at that 
time of the company?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;No. My managerial responsibilities ended at the
acquisition of H.D. Smith in January of 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;Mrs. Brooks. In January of 2018. Well, I will say that 
according to a document we received, the committee, the company 
cited its reason for taking this action and finally terminating 
the relationship with Family Discount was due to reference 
negative news articles.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    With that, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair will now recognize Mr. Ruiz for 5
minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;This crisis continues to overwhelm our healthcare system, 
and as an emergency physician I have been involved in the front 
lines taking care of opioid-addicted and overdosed patients way 
before it made national headlines. Doctors struggle with 
treating pain adequately and identifying drug seekers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;Hospitals in my district are seeing an increase in 
uncompensated care, because they are seeing more and more 
patients with chronic opioid-related kidney, heart, and lung 
complications, not to mention overdoses.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;It is good that more funds are going to fight the opioid 
epidemic. I agree with that. I encourage that. But if you 
eliminate mental health coverage, emergency care coverage as an 
essential health benefit, or if you repeal Medicaid expansion, 
then you actually are taking 1 step forward and 10 steps back 
and are actually hurting patients and making the problem worse.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;Moving forward, I think it is critical that the various 
players--DEA, hospitals, physicians, pharmacists, 
manufacturers, and distributors--work together to identify and 
implement systems and processes that move us forward to 
identify and implement solutions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;I understand that as this crisis has continued to escalate, 
many of you have put internal systems in place to increase 
accountability, but we have been told that before and it turned 
out to be untrue. And there's a difference between what you 
have on paper and what you are actually implementing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;At our March 20 hearing, members of this committee 
described the quantity of opioid pills sent to particular 
pharmacies in this region and asked DEA Administrator Patterson 
whether those amounts were excessive and whether the 
distributors failed to adequately exercise due diligence. The 
DEA agreed on both counts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;So I'd like to quickly go down the line and find out 
whether the problems that led to this overdistribution have 
been fixed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;Dr. Mastandrea, Miami-Luken distributed substantial 
quantities of pills to certain places in West Virginia. For 
example, your company sent Sav-Rite pharmacy in Kermit, a 
population of only 400, nearly 2 million pills in just 1 year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;Would Miami-Luken's current system discover these large 
shipments and more closely examine them to determine if such a 
large volume was appropriate and not going to a rogue 
operation, such as a pill mill?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;And how can you guarantee us that that system
will be implemented?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. It's already implemented.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;So you're saying that there's no mistakes
currently being done that you know of? There's no way of--what 
is your system to find and review in case you do make a 
mistake?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Each order is reviewed by our--we purchased 
a Buzzeo system. It's a computer algorithm that tells us 
whether or not the order deviates from frequency, pattern, 
size. And we stop it in real time if it does. We pend the 
order. If the order is adjudicated to be an appropriate order, 
then we release it. If it's not, then we report it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;The DEA data indicate that McKesson also supplied
the Sav-Rite in Kermit, population of 400, with almost 5 
million opioids over a 2-year period.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;    So, Mr. Hammergren, if a pharmacy serving a comparable 
population placed those large orders today, particularly in an 
area hard hit by opioid diversion, would McKesson's monitoring 
systems be capable of flagging these orders for further review 
to make sure that they are not affiliated with a pill mill?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, that's a good question. We
would not ship to Sav-Rite today.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; OK. So, in terms of your system, if this happened
to another comparable city, do you have a system in place to 
flag? The first question.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We have a system in place that would block
the order if it was a pharmacy that was outside of a boundary, 
a threshold being set.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; So why hasn't that happened? Why did you have
another settlement in 2017, when you told us this exact same 
thing in 2008?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We had a system in place from 2008 to block
suspicious orders. Our settlement in 2017 was really related to 
our reporting of suspicious orders.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;And so the implementation of those reporting and
also the shipping of orders.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;So I think it's very important that we also identify, which 
we see on multiple scenarios where corporations and agencies 
will hold up their policy on paper, but then the actual 
implementation of those are either not enforced or they're not 
transparent to determine what's working and what's not working.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt;    Mr. Collis, since you are now responsible for H.D. Smith's 
customers as well as your own, this question is for you. 
Without debating the merits of the West Virginia litigation 
that's currently undergoing, do you now have a way to assess 
orders for high volumes of pills against the populations 
receiving them?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; I believe we do. I believe we have a robust
system and we've always had one.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Ruiz&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Ruiz"&gt; OK. I yield back my time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair will now recognize the gentleman from
Michigan, Mr. Walberg, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for
having these hearings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;As we look at the various players--and today, of course, we 
have distributors--we had the opportunity to have DEA in front 
of us, and that was an amazing time of testimony as well with 
amazing failings that went on in DEA also.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;But this epidemic knows no boundaries. When we talk of 
losing 115 Americans every day to the opioid epidemic, these 
are people that are our neighbors, our friends, our fathers, 
our family members, our sons, our daughters, our mothers. It 
knows no bounds. But the sheer number of opioids dumped into 
small town America is simply baffling and incomprehensible to 
me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Many of us have tragic stories of pill mills in our 
district. And my district in Michigan is, unfortunately, no 
different. In Monroe County, one doctor alone was able to get 
his hands and prescribe over 2 million pain killers in just two 
short years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;I, for one, am interested to have the distributors here 
today to tell us exactly how and why this type of thing happens 
and to hear the steps that they have or will take.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;    Mr. Collis, you wrote in an editorial last year that 
AmerisourceBergen has, and I quote, ``reported and stopped tens 
of thousands of suspicious orders since 2007,'' end quote. If a 
specific pharmacy is reported for suspicious orders multiple 
times during a short period, would that trigger a heightened 
investigation of that customer?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; I believe it absolutely would. I wouldn't say
we don't make mistakes, but I will tell you one of pharmacies 
that's been mentioned several times, we had them on service for 
38 days, and we reported them 36 of the 38 days. And on the 
38th day we stopped servicing them.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;In the editorial, you also noted that
AmerisourceBergen uses, and I quote, ``complex algorithms to 
identify and stop orders that are deemed to be suspicious.'' 
From 2012 to 2015, AmerisourceBergen reported 394 suspicious 
orders for a single West Virginia pharmacy, Beckley Pharmacy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;    If the company opens an investigation of a pharmacy like 
Beckley, the investigators would want to know the percent of 
controlled substance prescriptions the pharmacy filled, 
correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; That's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; Whether there are signs of drug activity
around the pharmacy. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; We would review the type of business that they
are servicing. Some of my colleagues on the panel here have 
talked about the type of business. If they service a hospice 
account or pain management clinic, we would investigate that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; If there are any known pill mill doctors
writing prescriptions, you would want to note that, correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; If we knew that they were servicing a pill mill
doctor, by your description, we would not service that 
pharmacy. If their business was designed around that, we would 
not service that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;AmerisourceBergen reported 199 of its
suspicious orders for Beckley Pharmacy between 2013 and March 
of 2014. But documents your company provided to the committee 
indicate that Amerisource didn't investigate the pharmacy until 
February 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Please, if you would, turn to tab 46 to see the 
investigator's February 2015 report, which found, and I'll read 
that:&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;The pharmacist said that 50 percent of prescriptions he 
filled were for controlled substances and that customers told 
him other pharmacies wouldn't fill their prescriptions. Some of 
the pharmacies top 10 prescribers were among the top 
hydrocodone prescribers in the State, and the pharmacy security 
guard referred to customers as drug addicts and drug dealers 
and said he witnessed numerous drug deals in the parking lot 
after customers filled oxycodone prescriptions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Amerisource didn't stop doing business with that pharmacy 
until November 2015, 10 months after the investigator's report, 
which itself came only after your company filled hundreds of 
suspicious orders. The company is supposed to use, and I quote, 
``complex algorithms'' to identify problems pharmacies have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;    So why did it take so long?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; I have a team, some them are behind me. We
trust them. I think that we--I have never heard of this 
pharmacy before. But we're committed to continuous learning. 
And if we made mistakes, hopefully we'll rectify them and they 
won't happen in the future.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt; Well, if we could get the response to that
question, since you're not aware of it. It comes from your 
reports and the reports that we have in front of us.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; We ship 100,000 orders a day. It's not feasible
that I would know about all the orders.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Walberg&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;Well, we'll appreciate the response to that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Walberg"&gt;    Mr. Chairman, I have other questions I'll have included in 
the record.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Certainly. Each of the witnesses will be aware,
you may be getting written questions following this. We'd ask 
for your response to those as quickly as possible, including an 
answer to that question, Mr. Collis, at your earliest 
convenience.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;At this time, the Chair will recognize the gentlewoman from 
California, Mrs. Walters, for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mrs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And, Mr. Barrett, these questions will be asked of you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;When Cardinal began setting threshold limits for pharmacies 
in 2008, the company set Family Discount's hydrocodone 
threshold at 27,000 doses a month. In a little over a year, 
Cardinal adjusted the pharmacy's threshold 14 times. And by 
August 2009, it was cleared to receive 110,000 hydrocodone 
pills a month.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The pharmacy's threshold for hydrocodone reached a peak of 
150,000 dosages a month in January 2010, a level it remained at 
for a year and a half before Cardinal officials reviewed and 
reduced it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Mr. Barrett, when a pharmacy goes over its monthly drug 
threshold, does Cardinal inquire about the reason for the 
higher drug order?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Thank you, Congresswoman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Today, if an order reaches its threshold, it simply stops. 
So the process is the threshold is set, and the threshold is 
set based on a number of factors, the size of the community it 
serves, not just the population but the community it serves. 
Other factors. Does it serve a hospice center, a surgical 
center, et cetera. If an order reaches that threshold, that 
limit, it simply stops.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Mrs. Walters. But in the past, did it question it, before 
today?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;So as I look back at some of the historical
documents, I think the thresholds probably should have been set 
with a different set of eyes. I've mentioned this notion of 
asking different questions. And I think today we'd probably set 
those quite differently.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;But I think at the time of those pharmacies you referred 
to, thresholds probably should have been adjusted down more 
quickly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Mrs. Walters. Did they--did Cardinal make an assessment as 
to whether the explanation for increasing its threshold made 
sense and verified it in any way?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;It's hard for me to answer that fully. Again,
this is part of the history. I have no reason to question the 
good intent of those doing that kind of assessment. They were 
professionals. I think they were looking at the incoming order 
of prescribing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I think now we know some of that prescribing was driven by 
some behavior that we would have liked to have caught in the 
physician world. And today that simply could not happen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mrs. Walters. OK. In Family Discount's case, the pharmacy 
gave several explanations as to why it needed higher drug 
threshold. But in April 2009, the pharmacy said its hydrocodone 
volumes increased because of the closure of a nearby pharmacy 
called Sav-Rite pharmacy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Mr. Barrett, do you know why Sav-Rite closed in 2009?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I'm sorry, Congresswoman, I don't.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mrs. Walters. OK. Well, it closed because it was raided by 
the DEA as part of a crackdown on prescription drug diversion.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Sav-Rite, which is located about 30 miles away from Family 
Discount, closed after it was raided by the DEA, as I just 
mentioned. And the raid was covered in the local media at the 
time, but due diligence files Cardinal provided the committee 
do not indicate that the company knew about this event. Is that 
something Cardinal should have investigated or known?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I think today under our procedures in our,
essentially, know your customer model, we try to take into 
account what factors that we can that are fact. Those weigh 
into the judgment along with various analytical tools that 
relate to the nature of the community of practices that a 
pharmacy serves. So very likely today that would have been a 
factor that would have been--it would have been caught in the 
system.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Mrs. Walters. OK. Cardinal's policies indicate that, as of 
2016, two people must now sign off on the decision to raise 
certain drug threshold levels above 20,000 and above 40,000 a 
month. Before that policy was adopted, was Cardinal failing to 
properly vet threshold level adjustments?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I'm not sure, Congresswoman, that I could say
that we were failing to reflect that. I think we were using the 
tools of the moment. And it was probably much more subjective 
judgment than what would happen today. Today it is a much more 
rigorous, evidence-based, data-based decision, and it doesn't 
have the same kind of subjectively I think that was present at 
that moment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mrs. Walters. OK. Cardinal Health has advised the committee 
staff that, starting in 2012, your corporation implemented 
stronger compliance systems. However, I would note that, in 
March 2017, the California State Board of Pharmacy filed a 
complaint against Cardinal's Valencia, California, facility for 
shipping suspicious orders, including hydrocodone, during 2012 
to 2015, to Pacific Plaza Pharmacy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I would further note that the conduct of the Cardinal 
Valencia facility figured in the 2008 $34 million settlement 
with the Justice Department and DEA. The shipments to Pacific 
Plaza involved sharp increases in the volume of controlled 
substances over a period of time. There were also orders of 
significant amounts of the highest available strength of drug 
compared to lower strengths, a red flag for illegitimate 
pharmacy dispensing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    I understand Cardinal is contesting the complaint. But, Mr. 
Barrett, shouldn't Cardinal Health's stronger compliance system 
have been able to detect and to prevent these transactions?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Congresswoman, if I'm responding, I think, to
the case that you referred to, and, again, this is important, 
we ship to a pharmacy that had an employee that stole a 
product. We were then criticized for shipping to the pharmacy 
and not being able to detect that internal theft.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Again, I think this in some ways highlights part of the 
challenge. We ship to hospitals and pharmacies all over this 
country. There are things that may happen inside their watch.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;If the volumes are not things that would normally hit our 
thresholds that are happening at a much lower level, and this 
can happen, that is something we probably would not somebody 
detect.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;And so, again, this may or may not be the situation you're 
referring to. If it is, and I think it may be, that's 
essentially what the issue is.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;But for us today, we are driven by strict thresholds, and 
those are limits on the amount of certain products, 120 
categories of drugs that can go to certain pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mrs. Walters. OK. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    I'm out of time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia, Mr. Carter, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;And thank all of you for being here today. We appreciate 
this very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I have to say that I'm pleased thus far that my colleagues 
have not made this a witch hunt. But instead, I think they've 
asked some great questions and very fair questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;What I've heard, and I've been kind of in and out, but what 
I've heard is that you've acknowledged that you have a 
responsibility here and that you understand that. What I think 
I've also heard is that if you knew back then what you know 
now, you'd do things differently. And I think that's true for 
all of us in this profession. And I say that having practiced 
pharmacy for over 30 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I'm going to ask you all to be very, very honest with me 
right now, because I'm concerned, as Dr. Burgess mentioned, 
about the role of the DEA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Now, we've already had the DEA before this committee, and I 
think we had--I think we kind of had it backwards. I wish I 
could have another shot at them, to be quite honest with you, 
to ask them some questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;But let me--I just ask any of you. I assume all of you are 
compliant to ARCOS, that you're reporting. What does DEA do 
with that information? Do you know? And if you can be brief, 
because I've got a bunch of questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    I ask you, Mr. Hammergren. Do you have any idea what DEA 
does with that information?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;No, I don't, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;    I would also say, Congressman, some of this testimony, you 
see these pharmacies switch wholesalers back and forth.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; We don't see it before that happens.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Mr. Collis, do you have any idea what the DEA does with 
this?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; No. No. We would like more feedback. We'd also
like [off mic] the rules, for example, on what constitutes a 
suspicious order.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; Very, very helpful. I know one of the gentlemen
and I think we would be very interested in complying with the 
rules.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Let me ask any of you. Has the DEA ever come to
you and said do not send opioids to that pharmacy or to that 
clinic or to that hospital? Has anybody ever been told that by 
the DEA?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; Not to my knowledge.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Have they ever given you any kind of directions
or guidelines? You know, I get it if they're outside of the 
rim, you know, and obviously there's something going on. But, I 
mean, aside from that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Well in 2007, we had a lot of discussion with
them, and we developed our current controlled substance order 
monitoring program and with the understanding that this was 
where they wanted the industry to go to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;So I would say we do have regular consultation with them. 
We have worked with them on training programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;    I wouldn't say it's--I would say, like all relationships, 
it can be improved and worked upon.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt; Right. Right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; But it's not totally without communication and
collaboration.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Let me ask you this. Obviously, you know the
difference in a schedule two drug and a schedule three drug. 
The DEA schedules those depending on the tendency for 
addiction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    When did hydrocodone become a C two drug?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; I do not know.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I will tell you. It became a C two drug in
2014.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Why did it take so long, do you think, for the DEA to 
reclassify hydrocodone from a C three to a C two drug? Do you 
treat C two drugs differently from C three drugs?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I know you do, because when I get them from you, or when I 
used to get them from you, I had to sign different documents 
that came in a different box. They came sealed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Now, we're talking about all these pills that came here, 
and they weren't sealed, they weren't on a different invoice or 
anything else.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I'm just wondering, and, again, I wish I could ask the DEA 
this, why did it take so long to reschedule hydrocodone?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;The last thing I will say is this. Mr. Smith, you were 
involved in the situation in West Virginia. And I'm not taking 
up for you guys. You guys have a responsibility, and I believe 
you take that responsibility very seriously. And what I said 
earlier, I believe. I believe that if you had it to do to over 
again, you'd do some things differently.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Mr. Smith, there was a doctor, a Dr. Katherine Hoover, who 
accounted for 69 percent of all the prescriptions that were 
written during that timeframe in this town in West Virginia. Do 
you know whatever came about with Dr. Hoover? Do you know where 
she is today?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I believe they referred to her earlier, and that
she's either--oh, I'm sorry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;Thanks, Steve.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    I believe she was referred to earlier and that there's 
either been disciplinary action taken with her or she's left--
--
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;She fled to the Bahamas. She bought an island.
Twenty-one doctors, Dr. Burgess pointed out, 21 doctors in the 
whole Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Now, when you're sending drugs to a pharmacy, and it's out 
of control, there's one of two things happening. Either that 
pharmacy is out of control and they're selling drugs out the 
back door, or there's a doctor who's out of control in that 
area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Has the DEA ever come to you asking you about a particular 
doctor?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; Not to the best of my knowledge.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Nobody has.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. We have received subpoenas regarding 
physicians.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Carter&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;Good. Thank you. I'm glad to hear that. And I
hope that we will hear that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;I'm sorry. I'm out of time. But, again, we all have 
responsibility in this. All of us. There is no one solution to 
the opioid epidemic. All of us. Pharmacists, distributors, 
manufacturers, physicians, all of us have a responsibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;And I appreciate your role in that responsibility and you 
accepting that role in that responsibility. This is very 
important. You can help, and I hope that you are committed to 
helping. I believe that you are.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Mr. Carter"&gt;    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="579" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    The Chair will now recognize the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania, Mr. Costello, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Mr. Barrett, the committee asked Cardinal Health how it 
assessed whether the 6.5 million opioid pills distributed to 
Family Discount Pharmacy over a 5-year period was an 
appropriate number to send to a town of less than 2,000 people. 
The company's response was that Family Discount in Mount Gay-
Shamrock was a large pharmacy that served the broader Logan 
County, which has a population of 35,000 people.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    When Cardinal investigators reviewed several high-volume 
purchases of controlled substances in 2008, they did not cite 
the county population in their investigation. They instead 
cited the population within a 35-mile radius of the pharmacy as 
2,600 people. I know which figure looks better for the company, 
but why is the company now relying on the county population 
data when it cited a more limited area in its investigation of 
this pharmacy?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mr. Congressman, let me start by saying, and I
have mentioned earlier, if we looked at that pharmacy today and 
those patterns, we would have come to different conclusions. So 
I can only observe what I see in the documents back then.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I think the pharmacy is--its volumes are not necessarily 
dictated by the size of the community. It's dictated by the 
nature of the customers that it serves: hospitals, clinics, 
surgery centers, regional centers.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;So in some cases, rural centers--excuse me--rural 
pharmacies, which have small populations, search a large area. 
So I think that may have been part of the judgment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    What is important for me today is looking at it with 
today's eyes. And with today's eyes, I still think we would 
have made a different decision.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Cardinal also told the committee that when assessing 
pharmacy drug orders it doesn't have the full picture of how 
many pills are being sent to a pharmacy or the surrounding area 
by other distributors. That's because the company does not have 
the ARCOS data collected by the DEA. But this argument that the 
distributor has to see the full picture to recognize issues 
with its own distribution is nevertheless problematic, I think.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="589" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Using ARCOS data, the committee was able to determine how 
many opioids Cardinal alone dispensed to pharmacies in ZIP 
Codes surrounding Family Discount. The company sent over 16 
million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills to that West Virginia 
region between 2006 and 2016. Family Discount received 6.7 
million of those pills and its Stollings location received 
another 1 million.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="590" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Mr. McKinley, I apologize if I pronounced Stollings wrong. 
I think I got it right, but if I did.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="591" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Cardinal could see that 46 percent of its own distribution 
of opiates to the region was going to two related pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="592" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    Mr. Barrett, can you really tell me that Cardinal needed to 
know what other companies were distributing in order to raise a 
red flag? I understand what you just said about hospitals in 
the region, but I'm trying to dig a little bit deeper here.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="593" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; So again, I can only repeat what I've said
about this. I've seen enough in reviewing this file to say that 
we should have seen patterns earlier. But I think the comment 
that was in our document is generally true about how we do 
assessment of pharmacies, that there are many factors that go 
beyond simply the size of the community.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="594" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; Right. But you did cut off Family Discount in
2012. Why is that?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="595" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Again, I think our team had enough data at
that point in that moment at that time to say we are not 
comfortable with these levels of hydrocodone and oxycodone and 
at that point made a decision to cut off those pharmacies.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="596" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; But that data did not yield conclusions as to
other pharmacies at that moment in time? Presumably not if you 
didn't stop.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="597" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I really can't answer that. I'm sorry. I just
don't know the answer to that, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="598" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; In addition to knowing what Cardinal itself
distributes to a pharmacy, the company can also ask a pharmacy 
to produce a drug dispensing report. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="599" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I'm sorry. Could you repeat one more time
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="600" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; In addition to knowing what Cardinal itself
distributes to a pharmacy, the company can also ask a pharmacy 
to produce a drug dispensing report. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="601" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I think that may occur from time to time, yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="602" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; In the case of Family Discount, Cardinal
asked for and received drug dispensing reports, an example of 
which can be found on tab 55, tab 55 in the document binder. 
Dispensing reports contain information about all the 
prescriptions and drugs a pharmacy sends out the door, not just 
the drugs that Cardinal supplied. Is that correct?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="603" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I think that's correct, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="604" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt; And for Family Discount, investigators
requested drug dispensing reports multiple times as they 
reviewed high orders for controlled substances. Isn't that 
right?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="605" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Sir, I believe all this is in the documents.
But I believe that's correct.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Costello&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="606" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;Very good.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="607" speaker="Mr. Costello"&gt;    I will yield back the balance of my time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The Chair will now recognize the gentlewoman
from Tennessee, Mrs. Blackburn, for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Thank you all for being here today. We appreciate this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And I think probably what you're hearing from us on each 
side of this dais is enough is enough. And you all have faced 
penalties. You have had settlements. You have had memorandums. 
We have covered every bit of that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And just as we are doing more at this committee to get our 
arms around this issue, legislation that we are moving forward 
with, we expect you all to do more also.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And I have spent a lot of my time since I was in the senate 
in Tennessee, the Tennessee State Senate, doing roundtables, 
visiting treatment centers, sitting down with families, law 
enforcement, hearing their stories. And what we know is that 
the opioid crisis is different. The detox, the treatment, the 
recovery is different. And this is going to have to be a 
concerted effort to end this crisis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And Senator Portman has CARA 2.0 in the Senate. I have it 
along with Congressman Ryan here in the House. It's totally 
bipartisan. Another billion dollars to go toward addressing 
this crisis. So we do expect you all to work with us on this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And I have got kind of a different set of questions I want 
to run through fairly quickly, and this will be a yes or no. 
And I'm going to start with you, Mr. Barrett, straight down the 
list.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    Have any of you personally met with families who have lost 
loved ones or survivors, individuals who are in recovery? Just 
yes or no right down the line.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Yes, ma'am.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I have not.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. You have not?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. OK. So four of you have.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;    Now, let me ask you this. Do you have employees who are in 
treatment or recovery for opioid addiction, and does your 
insurance cover that treatment for these employees? Because 
what I understand is it takes about a year to a year and a half 
for someone to rewire their brain. Yes or no, straight down the 
line.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I believe our coverage does cover behavioral
health issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes, we do have employees who have had 
substance abuse problems, and we do cover substance abuse 
treatment.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Sadly, Congresswoman, I've had employees as
well that are in treatment. And in addition to the insurance, 
we've also got a fund that helps them anytime it's outside of 
the treatment from insurance to cover those costs.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I was generally not told about any health
conditions of any employees, so I can't speak to that. But I do 
believe that during my tenure that would have been covered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. Yes or no is fine.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="630" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="631" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;I'm not aware. I do not know.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. You do not know.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;    Well, let me ask you this. When you started distributing 
the opioids, were you aware of the addictive nature of this 
drug? Yes or no, straight down the line.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Our company's been distributing opioids----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. Yes or no.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mr. Barrett [continuing]. For as long as it's been in 
business. I would assume that we know that all drugs have side 
effects.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Yes or no.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Dr. Mastandrea. Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. You were.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Dr. Mastandrea. We know the requirements of the DEA 
schedules.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. OK.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;We know there's a tradeoff with every drug.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. OK. All right.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;It's done in a pure clinical decision.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;OK. We've talked a little bit about your algorithms and the 
way you've changed your protocols, moving to more of an 
evidence-based database, a platform less subjective. And we 
hope that that helps with the distribution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;I want to know from each of you, how many pharmacies have 
you removed from your distribution list?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;    Straight down the line. You can say--give me the number or 
``I don't know.'' And then you'll submit it for the record.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;We have 800.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. I'll get to you in a minute.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;We have cut off or refused to do business with
a thousand or more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. A thousand.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    You don't know? Please submit for the record.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;Hundreds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. Hundreds? I'd like an exact, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="659" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;What time period are you asking for?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="660" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. Well, through the history of your company. 
How many of----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="661" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;I wouldn't be able to give an exact number, but
hundreds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="662" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. OK, find a number and let us know.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="663" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;We have a robust list that we have 800
pharmacies.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="664" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;    Mrs. Blackburn. I would to know--800. That you've cut off 
or that you distribute to?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="665" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;That we do not ship to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="666" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;Mrs. Blackburn. Eight hundred. OK. That is wonderful.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="667" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;And how often does your algorithm flag a--and you all can 
submit this, because I'm out of time and there are others who 
want questions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="668" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;I want to know, how often does your system flag a bad 
pharmacy? And then what is your threshold? You have mentioned 
thresholds several times, but you have not given a specific as 
to what that threshold is that kicks a pharmacy out. And if 
each of you will submit that in writing, I'd appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="669" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt;    Thank you. I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="670" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair will now recognize the gentleman from
New Jersey, Mr. Lance, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="671" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="672" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Dr. Mastandrea, Miami-Luken noted that in June of 2015, 
following a review of Westside Pharmacy's dispensing data, the 
company identified concerns with two of the pharmacy's top 
prescribing physicians of oxycodone, Dr. David Morgan and Dr. 
Sanjay Mehta. The company has said that you expressed your 
concerns to the pharmacy's owner who assured you the pharmacy 
would no longer fill their prescriptions effective June 30 of 
2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;However, as I understand it, in October of that year, 
Miami-Luken learned that Drs. Morgan and Mehta continued to be 
among the pharmacy's top prescribing physicians.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;When Miami-Luken learned that Westside pharmacy had not 
been truthful by continuing to fill prescriptions written by 
these doctors, did you drop the pharmacy as a customer?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. We probably dropped that customer within 30 
days of finding out that she was not cooperating with us.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="676" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;On November 4, 2015, your director of compliance
performed a site evaluation at Westside Pharmacy. You will find 
this evaluation in the binder at tab 33. Shouldn't your site 
investigators have investigated the pharmacy's falsehoods 
instead of ignoring them?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. I'm sorry. The question was shouldn't the 
investigators have done what?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Shouldn't your site investigators have
investigated the pharmacy's falsehoods instead of apparently 
ignoring them?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. I think that they should have investigated 
the pharmacy in totality.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;After you knew the pharmacy wasn't telling you
the truth by continuing to fill prescriptions written by Drs. 
Morgan and Mehta, did Miami-Luken agree to increase Westside 
Pharmacy's oxycodone threshold in November 2015?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="681" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. I am not aware of that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="682" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;I request that you review the situation and give
the committee an answer, yes or no. Not being aware of that is 
not sufficient, and please report back to the committee with 
the answer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="683" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. My counsel will do so.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="684" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="685" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Given that the DEA cited Miami-Luken's relationship with 
Westside Pharmacy in its order to show cause, doesn't that 
raise a question in your mind about your company's due diligent 
efforts with respect to this pharmacy?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Congressman, we were in the process of 
vetting that particular customer at the time we received the 
order to show cause. We had already terminated--I believe there 
were 13 different customers that were on the order to show 
cause and we terminated, prior to receiving the order to show 
cause, all of them with the exception of Westside Pharmacy, 
which we were in the process of vetting at the time. When we 
found that they were on the order to show cause, enough was 
enough, and we terminated the relationship.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;It's my belief that the relationship was
terminated at a point well beyond when it should have been 
terminated.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;I realize that monitoring for and reporting suspicious 
records is often complicated. Therefore, I take this 
opportunity to discuss a proposal that may enable distributors 
and the DEA to use the data that is available to them in a more 
effective way. And this is for the entire panel.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="689" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Technology today that didn't exist when ARCOS was put into 
place is able to deliver information that would allow the DEA 
to stop a suspicious order before it is filled. I, along with 
colleagues in the Senate, I am working on a proposal that would 
create a new data platform for the DEA to utilize moving 
forward so that this situation is ameliorated to the greatest 
extent possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="690" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;To the entire panel, will you commit to working with me and 
other Members of Congress--and this will be completely 
bipartisan, I assure you--to create a system that can 
effectively ensure that we are ready to police suspicious 
orders in a way that is truly effective? And as Congresswoman 
Blackburn suggested, going down the line.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    Gentlemen.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;I would support any technology that would help
us do this job better, yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="693" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="694" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I look forward to working with you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; I am no longer employed in the industry, but I
wish you the best of luck.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="696" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt; Yes, we will need more than luck.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="697" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; Yes. Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Lance&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="698" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Mr. Lance"&gt;    I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="700" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="701" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And I would like to clarify for the record that Miami-Luken 
did increase the threshold, as Mr. Lance described. The Chair 
will now--and also would like to put into the record a letter 
so signifying.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Without objection.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    \1\ The letter appears in the document binder, which has been 
retained in committee files and also is available at  https://
docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=108260.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; Now the Chair will recognize the gentleman from
West Virginia, Mr. McKinley, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you,
because I'm not a member of this committee, for the opportunity 
to address the panel and carry on.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="706" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;I'm from West Virginia we've been hearing about all day 
today. The fury inside me right now is bubbling over with how 
we're going to address this problem. And for several of you to 
say you had no role whatsoever in this, I find it particularly 
offensive when we've had over 900 people a year dying in West 
Virginia because of lack of attention on your algorithm and 
your operation. And deflecting responsibility saying, ``I just 
had to fill the order,'' no, you had a role. You had a role.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="707" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    So let me just--Mr. Hammergren, if I could focus on you. 
You said you have notified the DEA of suspicious activity--
suspicious orders. But between years 2001 and 2014, did any of 
those suspicious orders involve West Virginia?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="708" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I can't be certain, Congressman. We've
reported between 2000--in that period of time, around a million 
orders to the DEA as suspicious.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="709" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;Well, I just want to, for all of you, between
2001 and 2014, none of you were complying with State law. State 
law says if there is a suspicious order that you file with the 
DEA, you're supposed to send a copy of that order to the West 
Virginia Board of Pharmacy, and none of you have done it 
between those time periods. Not only a suspicious order, but at 
the end of every month, you're supposed to file a report that 
says, during the past month, they give you 15 to the end of--
after 15 days, you're supposed to file a report with the Board 
of West Virginia Pharmacy saying no suspicious orders took 
place in West Virginia.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="710" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;But you didn't do it. And that was some of the heart. That 
was the genesis. That's when this disease really took hold in 
West Virginia. And you weren't complying. But yet you said the 
same thing. You said: We're not responsible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="711" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;I think you very much were responsible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="712" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    So, Mr. Hammergren, again, do you agree that a person like 
Dr. Hoover should be held accountable for her actions and 
perhaps pay more than a fine for her actions?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="713" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, I don't know Dr. Hoover, and I
don't know the situation of her case.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="714" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt; Do you just think in general doctors that
spread this poison, writing 40,000, 50,000, 100,000 of 
prescriptions on opioids, should pay a penalty?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="715" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Absolutely, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="716" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt; OK. What about pharmacies, pharmacies that
are following that order? The one that we have in particular, 
Sav-Rite pharmacy. Should that pharmacy, should that pharmacist 
be held accountable for what he's done?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="717" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; In fact, I think that pharmacy was closed,
per some earlier----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="718" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt; What about--no, no. It may have been closed.
He may have lost his job. But what about him or her who filled 
the order? Should she have been held accountable?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="719" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I don't know the specifics. I can't comment
on it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="720" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;OK. I'm coming back. I'm setting this up. I
want to know whether you all should be held accountable. 
Because if the doctors and the pharmacies are being held 
accountable, I sure as the dickens would think you all have a 
role in this thing, too.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="721" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    So if I could, I want to go back again, Mr. Hammergren, to 
you. Let me try again with another. Do you regret any role that 
your company has played in this crisis?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="722" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Congressman, I don't know how you could
look at this crisis and not feel terrible about what's going on 
in this country. And I certainly believe in situations like the 
Sav-Rite pharmacy and----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="723" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt; So you do regret----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="724" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;I feel terrible about this----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="725" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;    Mr. McKinley [continuing]. That what McKesson did in 
participating in this scourge that's ravaged this country, you 
regret it?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="726" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; I feel terrible about this crisis.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. McKinley&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="727" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;So what's the proper accountability? What's
the punishment? It's just a slap on the wrist of maybe 100th of 
1 percent of the revenue? What's the accountability, what's the 
punishment that fits this crime when 900 people in West 
Virginia lose their life or 115 people lose their lives across 
this country? Just a slap on the wrist? A financial penalty? Or 
should there be time spent for participating in this?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="728" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;So I just want you to feel shame about your roles, 
respectively, in all of this, how we're going to get through 
this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="729" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;So apparently I have run out of time, but--let me just 
leave it at that. I am so frustrated for the people in West 
Virginia and across this country that you all have not played 
and stepped up, took more responsibility for this.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="730" speaker="Mr. McKinley"&gt;    I yield back my time.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="731" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Ohio, Mr. Johnson, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="732" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="733" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;And, gentlemen, thank you for being here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="734" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;I have listened with interest to today's testimony and the 
questions that you have responded to. It's a very tough 
subject. Eastern and southeastern Ohio sits at the epicenter of 
the opioid epidemic. I hear about it every day that I'm out and 
about in my district.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="735" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;And I don't know if you've heard this yet today, but I'm 
glad you folks are at the table. And part of my questioning is 
going to be, where do we go from here? What are the solutions 
to this problem that you folks have been looking at and maybe 
some things that you're looking at down the road?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="736" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Let me start out with Dr. Mastandrea. Do I have that 
pronounced right? And I apologize&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="737" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Yes, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="738" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;OK.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="739" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;As I mentioned, I represent eastern and southeastern Ohio. 
It includes the town of Wheelersburg in Scioto County. In 2008 
Scioto County had an overdose death rate of more than 27 times 
the national average.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="740" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;For several years, 2005 through 2011, Dr. Margy Temponeras 
owned and operated the Unique Pain Management Clinic there in 
Wheelersburg. This clinic was a pill mill. Temponeras saw more 
than 20 patients per day who paid cash, starting at $200 for 
each appointment, and received monthly prescriptions for 
similar combinations of medications such as 120 to 150 pills of 
oxycodone and 90 pills of Xanax.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="741" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;In April of 2017, Dr. Temponeras pleaded guilty in U.S. 
District Court to conspiracy to distribute a controlled 
substance, which she did through a pain clinic and dispensary.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="742" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Between November 2008 and August 2010, Miami-Luken supplied 
the Unique Pain Management Clinic with controlled substances, 
including oxycodone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="743" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;So my first question. According to the DEA, December of 
2008 was the first full month that Miami-Luken began shipping 
to Dr. Temponeras. In that month's shipment, 97 percent of the 
total dosage units were controlled substances and 84 percent of 
the controlled substances ordered, totaling 71,100 dosage 
units, were oxycodone.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="744" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Do those numbers seem unusually high to you?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="745" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Congressman, I find it to be unusual that 
we would sell directly to a physician. I find it unusual that 
she would be a dispensing physician. By doing that, she 
bypassed all of the checks and balances that were in place.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="746" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;OK. But I'm not talking about what she did.
I'm talking about what you guys did. Did those numbers----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="747" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. That's right. And what we should not have 
done, we never should have supplied to a dispensing physician.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="748" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;All right. Given that, should those orders be
investigated, do you think?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="749" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Those orders should have never been 
shipped.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="750" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;But should they be investigated?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="751" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. How so?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="752" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Well, I think, if my facts are correct, Miami-
Luken claims to have investigated Dr. Temponeras and the 
clinic. You, yourself, stated that in November 2008 one of the 
company's salesmen conducted an inspection. However, according 
to the DEA, that inspection was cursory at best and it failed 
to take into account the area's prescription drug problem.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="753" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;Then, in 2009, Miami-Luken CEO Tony Rattini and compliance 
manager Jim Barclay showed up to investigate on a day when the 
facility was closed and never returned to visit when it was 
open.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="754" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;So I guess my question to you is, looking back in 
retrospect, are those instances, in your opinion, adequate due 
diligence? I mean, you express outrage now that it never should 
have happened. But was due diligence supplied, do you think, 
when the opportunity presented itself?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="755" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Due diligence was attempted in that 
particular situation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="756" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;When they showed up and didn't show back up,
the alarm bells didn't go off?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="757" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. I said it was attempted.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Johnson&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="758" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;OK. All right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="759" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;My time has expired. But I do appreciate you folks being 
here. And I know that--I know there's a lot of emotion around 
this issue. There certainly is in my district. And I want to 
thank you for any work that you are doing and continue to do to 
help us get a handle on this, 115 people dying per day. We need 
your engagement at your level to get this problem resolved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="760" speaker="Mr. Johnson"&gt;    Mr. Chair, I yield back.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="761" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt; The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Florida, Mr. Bilirakis, for 5 minutes.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="762" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="763" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;And I appreciate you all being here. This is something we 
need to focus on. It's an epidemic, and we need your 
engagement, as my colleagues said.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="764" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;So I'm glad to hear that the drug distributors acted in 
recent years to reform the policies and tighten controls on the 
distribution of opioid pain pains. But I'm surprised to hear, 
why did it take so long?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="765" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;And Florida was awash in pain-- I represent the State of 
Florida, the Tampa Bay area, as you know, and the Tampa Bay 
area, in particular, but the whole State of Florida was awash 
in pain pills back in 2010. And it's taken significant efforts 
by law enforcement and Florida lawmakers, the local lawmakers, 
to battle the prescription drug epidemic in recent years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="766" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;On the part of the distributors, I'm concerned that you may 
not be on the same page. For instance, Mr. Barrett, Cardinal 
was the subject of a DEA administration action in Florida 
several times over the years. The DEA took enforcement action 
against Cardinal's Lakeland, Florida, distribution center in 
2007 for failure to maintain effective controls against the 
diversion of hydrocodone and again for similar allegations 
involving oxycodone in 2012.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="767" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;In court documents involving the 2012 action, the company 
made an interesting point. Cardinal said between 2009 and 2012 
it stopped distributing controlled substances to 149 Florida 
pharmacies. But the company noted that 113 of those Florida 
pharmacies still had DEA registrations as of 2012. That means 
even though Cardinal had cut off pharmacies it suspected of 
drug diversion, other drug distributors were still doing 
business with them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="768" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;I understand the committee's investigation turned up 
numerous examples in West Virginia of one distributor dropping 
a pharmacy due to diversion concerns only for another 
distributor to immediately start doing business with the 
pharmacy. I mean, that's very concerning again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="769" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;So for all the witnesses, starting over here, I'd like all 
your companies to address two questions, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="770" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;First, when your company is considering bringing on a new 
pharmacy as a customer, do you verify whether that particular 
pharmacy was cut off from another distributor for suspected 
diversion?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="771" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Please begin.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="772" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Congressman, I don't think we can know for
sure. Actually, we don't have access to that information that 
another company has necessarily cut off a pharmacy. We may, but 
there's nothing in the mechanics of the regulatory process that 
makes that happen.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="773" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;All right. Next, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="774" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. We ask them whether or not--why they are 
coming to us and whether or not they were with another 
distributor and why they left that distributor.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="775" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;And you take their word for it?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="776" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. We do as much due diligence investigation 
as we possibly can, but it's, unfortunately, a trade.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="777" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Next, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="778" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; It's difficult for us to get accurate
information on that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="779" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Next, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="780" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; In my experience at H.D. Smith, that was
something that we sought from the customer, an explanation, if 
they were leaving another wholesaler. But, no, we didn't talk 
to the other wholesaler about it.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="781" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Next.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="782" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; I agree with the previous comments. That
information would be very helpful, Congressman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="783" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;OK. Next question. And second, what
safeguards do you have in place to ensure your company is not 
bringing on a bad actor as a customer after they were dropped 
by one of your competitors?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="784" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Let's start again from you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="785" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; So, Congressman, given the observation I made
earlier, which is you don't know for certain, we try to take, 
in this know-your-customer program of ours, any information 
that will help us dictate the nature of that pharmacy, who it 
serves, what its customers are, and whether or not there are 
any red flags.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="786" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; So what safeguards do you have?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="787" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; I'm sorry?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="788" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; What safeguards do you have in place, any
particular safeguards? Name a few safeguards.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="789" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Well, as I mentioned today, we have either not
taken on or shut off a thousand pharmacies over these last 7 or 
8 years. So we literally put in place----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="790" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; What kind of process?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="791" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; If they won't qualify, they don't get products
from us.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="792" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Do you have any kind of a process that you
go through?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="793" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Yes, a very rigorous process, sir.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="794" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;All right. Go next, because I don't have a
lot of time. Next, sir, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="795" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. We ask for drug utilization reviews from 
every new customer.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="796" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; All right. Next, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="797" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;We certainly--first, we'll check with the
regulatory agencies, the DEA and the State boards of pharmacy, 
make sure the licensing is all done. That would be a baseline 
check.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="798" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt;    So certainly if there was a problem that was reported to 
the DEA and the DEA reported it to us, or a State pharmacy 
board, that would be the end of the decision relative to that 
pharmacy.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="799" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Do you do that as well, sir?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="800" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; We had a due diligence process that included all
the elements I think that you've heard from the other 
wholesalers.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="801" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; OK. Yes, please.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="802" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; If we did bring on a new customer, we would
have extensive monitoring requirements and look at--in our 
suspicious order program, we'd be looking at what is the 
content of the orders that we receive from that pharmacy.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="803" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; Would you also--for the first two--would you
also check with the regulatory agencies as well.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="804" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; Yes. We can't onboard a pharmacy without the
proper authorization from the regulatory agencies.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="805" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt; That's a common practice for you as well?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="806" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt; It's a standard practice.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Bilirakis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="807" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;OK. Standard practice.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="808" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;OK. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="809" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"&gt;    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="810" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;The gentleman yields back.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="811" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;Certainly, I think each of you recognize and would agree 
that the distributors are the first line of defense against 
diversion of opioids.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="812" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;And I know we've spent a lot of time on West Virginia. Is 
it been on the front line of the opioid epidemic. That's why we 
use apportions of the State as a case study in this 
investigation. But it leads us to wonder are there other hot 
spots across the country that there are problems that maybe we 
haven't really seen enough of that information yet.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="813" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    So given what you've heard today, will each of you commit 
to look for communities across the country where the volume of 
opioids that your company distributed appear far in excess of 
what the community can sustain?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Barrett&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="814" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;Sir, we will and we do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="815" speaker="Mr. Barrett"&gt;    Dr. Mastandrea. Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Hammergren&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="816" speaker="Mr. Hammergren"&gt; Absolutely.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Smith&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="817" speaker="Mr. Smith"&gt; I'm not in a position to do that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Collis&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="818" speaker="Mr. Collis"&gt; We will. And, unfortunately, you know, opioids
seem to thrive in communities where there often is, you know, 
hardship. And so we feel particularly concerned about that.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="819" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;I want to thank each of you for taking your
valuable time to help us on this very important matter. I know 
everyone recognizes the seriousness of this. We're going to 
have to look at every aspect of what goes on. But we do 
appreciate the time.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="820" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;    I want to remind Members that they have 10 business days to 
submit questions for the record. And I ask that the witnesses 
agree to respond promptly to those questions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Harper&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="821" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;With that, the subcommittee is adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="822" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;[Whereupon, at 12:50 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="823" speaker="Mr. Harper"&gt;[Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
