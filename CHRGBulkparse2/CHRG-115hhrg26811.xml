                          I. Executive Summary
                       Statement From the Chairs
    Seventeen years after the establishment of the 
Congressional-
Executive Commission on China, the Commission's mandate to 
monitor human rights and the development of the rule of law in 
China remains wholly relevant and urgently necessary.
    China has benefited immensely from the international rules-
based order in driving its growth and lifting millions out of 
poverty, but the political reform many believed would accompany 
China's economic transformation and accession to the World 
Trade Organization has failed to materialize. Chinese 
government claims of global leadership in areas such as trade, 
environmental protection, and the building of international 
institutions--as expressed by President and Communist Party 
Secretary Xi Jinping at several high-profile international 
forums this past year--are belied by the reality of the Chinese 
government's actions, which are not that of a responsible 
stakeholder.
    While China stresses the need for global connectivity and 
openness, it continues to strengthen the world's most 
sophisticated system of Internet control and press censorship 
and forges ahead with what it calls ``Internet sovereignty,'' 
the notion that nations should have total control over the 
Internet within their borders. The Chinese government's 
expansive notion of sovereignty gives officials license to 
decry international criticism of their human rights record as 
one country interfering in the affairs of another. All the 
while, the Chinese government extends its own ``long arm'' to 
threaten and intimidate political and religious dissidents and 
critics living abroad; establishes Confucius Institutes at 
colleges and universities around the world, influencing these 
academic environments with its political agenda; and invests 
heavily in overseas media, exporting state propaganda and 
exercising soft power to shape movie production and other 
cultural media. Moreover, Chinese officials' complaints of 
other nations' ``interference'' into China's affairs fail to 
take into account that the Chinese government is obligated to 
respect the fundamental rights of its citizens under its own 
constitution, and under international conventions it has 
willingly signed.
    The Commission is mandated to document cases of political 
prisoners in China--individuals who were detained or imprisoned 
by the Chinese government for exercising their civil, 
religious, and political rights. Steadfast advocacy on behalf 
of individual political and religious prisoners, more than 
1,400 of whom are active cases in the Commission's far from 
exhaustive Political Prisoner Database, remains vital. These 
men and women, whose ``crimes'' intersect with nearly every 
issue area covered in the Commission's Annual Report, represent 
the human toll exacted by China's repressive and authoritarian 
one-party system. The death from liver cancer in July 2017 of 
Liu Xiaobo--a Chinese intellectual and 2010 Nobel Peace Prize 
laureate who was serving an 11-year sentence for ``inciting 
subversion of state power'' in connection with his pro-
democracy work--brought renewed attention to the government and 
Party's shameful treatment of political prisoners. In his last 
days, authorities repeatedly denied Liu Xiaobo medical 
treatment abroad, counter to his wishes and those of his wife, 
Liu Xia.

                              Introduction
    The 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party 
is expected to convene around the time of the release of the 
Commission's 2017 Annual Report. In advance of the Party 
Congress, a twice-per-decade event, President and Communist 
Party General Secretary Xi Jinping has worked to consolidate 
power, as demonstrated by the formalization of his role as the 
``core'' (hexin) leader of the Party in guiding key policy 
sectors including the economy, domestic reform, and national 
defense. The anticorruption campaign against Party and 
government officials, Xi's signature domestic initiative, has 
effectively eliminated many of his potential political rivals, 
and in the process has destabilized patronage networks and 
certain political factions ahead of this gathering of Party 
elites. Yet, the campaign has failed to instill accountability, 
such as disclosure of officials' financial assets or meaningful 
institutional checks on political power. The composition of the 
Standing Committee of the Communist Party Central Committee 
Political Bureau (Politburo) that emerges from the 19th Party 
Congress will provide insight into the extent to which Xi may 
be able to further influence politics beyond his presumed 
second term as Party General Secretary.
    As Xi has centralized power, he has simultaneously demanded 
stricter ideological discipline within the Party and within 
organizations under the Party's umbrella. The Party continued 
to stress ideological conformity and discipline from media 
outlets and journalists, in particular that the media must 
function as a ``mouthpiece'' for the Party to shape ``public 
opinion'' with uncritical, positive news. Speaking in October 
2016 before a gathering of the heads of China's largest state 
companies, Xi stressed that ``Party leadership and building the 
role of the Party are the root and the soul for state-owned 
enterprises.'' Similarly, in remarks at a December 2016 meeting 
focused on the ideological work of China's universities, Xi 
reminded senior Party members and academic officials that 
``China's higher education institutions are under the 
leadership of the CCP, and are socialist universities with 
Chinese characteristics, so higher education must be guided by 
Marxism, and the Party's policies in education must be fully 
carried out.''
    With the release of China's National Human Rights Action 
Plan (2016-2020) in September 2016, the government continued to 
subordinate human rights policy to the ideological guidance of 
the Party, which diverges from international standards 
including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN 
Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip 
Alston, described this reality in his report on his August 2016 
mission to China: ``The greatest challenge . . . is to 
understand how the leading role of the Communist Party can 
coexist with the recognition of individual rights and the 
provision of meaningful accountability mechanisms . . ..'' The 
Special Rapporteur, furthermore, described intrusive government 
control of his schedule and surveillance of his movements in 
China in his report, giving further weight to the critiques of 
human rights organizations that the Chinese government has ``a 
poor record in engaging with UN human rights mechanisms in a 
constructive and cooperative fashion.''
    During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, the Chinese 
Communist Party continued to restrict the already limited space 
for expression, religious activity, and peaceful assembly. In 
addition to harassing and detaining government critics, Chinese 
authorities also targeted those promoting workers' rights, the 
rights of dispossessed villagers, and environmental protection. 
Chinese authorities intensified crackdowns on foreign aid 
workers, Christian churches, and non-governmental organizations 
that play a crucial role in assisting and facilitating the 
movement of North Korean refugees outside the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea. Official censorship contributed to 
the shrinking space for journalism and public debate. Citizen 
journalists, such as Liu Feiyue and Huang Qi, whose human 
rights websites are a key source of information on grassroots 
protests and other rights defense efforts, were criminally 
detained and as of September 2017 are awaiting prosecution. In 
August 2017, authorities in Yunnan province sentenced Lu Yuyu, 
the founder of ``Not the News''--a blog that published 
information on mass incidents relating primarily to labor 
protests--to four years in prison.
    Hopes surrounding positive legislative and policy 
developments this reporting year, including further reforms to 
the household registration (hukou) system, were tempered by 
continued problems with implementing reforms and uneven 
enforcement of laws and regulations. Implementation of the PRC 
Mental Health Law was marred by reports that government 
authorities continued to forcibly commit individuals without 
mental illness to psychiatric facilities (bei jingshenbing) for 
activities deemed ``troublemaking'' or politically 
``sensitive.'' While the Party's General Office launched a 
nationwide initiative to reform the Party-affiliated All-China 
Women's Federation, independent women's rights organizations 
were prevented from raising awareness of sexual harassment and 
the government continued to target individual women's rights 
advocates with criminal prosecution and harassment.
    Chinese authorities continued to implement a ``universal 
two-child policy'' and persisted in actively promoting coercive 
population control policies that violate international 
standards. Tellingly, the family planning bureaucratic 
apparatus remains intact. The Chinese government's population 
control policies have contributed to the country's demographic 
challenges, including a rapidly aging population and shrinking 
workforce that threaten to further slow China's economic 
growth.
    The Chinese government's lack of transparency affected many 
of the areas that the Commission monitors. Chinese authorities 
continued to consider pollution-related data to be sensitive 
and censored reporting on the environment. For outside 
observers, transparency concerns were at the forefront of 
China's Belt and Road Initiative, a far-reaching economic and 
political agenda aimed in part at shaping new global norms on 
development and trade, and thereby growing China's influence. 
The May 2017 Belt and Road forum culminated with the signing of 
a communique in which the heads of state present committed 
themselves to ``. . . democracy, good governance, the rule of 
law, human rights, gender equality and women empowerment.'' 
Meanwhile Chinese authorities detained dozens of petitioners 
and rights advocates in and around the gathering in Beijing 
municipality. In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), 
which Chinese officials have promoted as an important center 
for Belt and Road development projects, authorities reportedly 
heightened security controls over Uyghurs and other ethnic 
minorities who live there, and imposed severe restrictions on 
Internet access. In this same region, authorities began 
expediting the collection of residents' DNA on a massive scale, 
in many cases without consent, prompting transparency concerns 
regarding the purpose of collecting such information. An 
international rights group reported that the DNA collection was 
in connection with China's ``stability maintenance'' measures.
    The subsequent chapters of this report document these and 
other human rights and rule of law developments in China during 
the Commission's 2017 reporting year which spans, roughly, 
September 2016 through September 2017. Each chapter examines 
different aspects of the Chinese government's obligations to 
protect human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and key human rights conventions, as well as in 
China's Constitution. General themes and key developments 
covered in the body of this report are outlined below.
                                Overview
    Over the Commission's 2017 reporting year, the following 
general themes and key developments emerged:
        1. The government and Party continue to use the law as 
        an instrument of repression to expand control over 
        Chinese society.
        2. The criminalization of China's human rights lawyers 
        and advocates is ongoing, including credible reports of 
        torture in detention.
        3. Restrictions on religious freedom are intensifying, 
        particularly in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
        and Tibetan autonomous areas.
        4. Twenty years after the handover, the long-term 
        viability of the ``one country, two systems'' model in 
        Hong Kong is increasingly uncertain given central 
        government interference.
                 The Law as an Instrument of Repression
    The Commission observed that authorities continued to use 
the law as an instrument of repression to expand control over 
Chinese society, while outwardly providing the veneer of a 
system guided by the rule of law.
    The PRC Law on the Management of Overseas Non-Governmental 
Organizations' (NGOs) Activities took effect on January 1, 
2017. The government provided limited guidance for 
international NGOs attempting to comply with the law, creating 
an uncertain operating environment for these NGOs as well as 
their local Chinese partners. Moreover, as many of China's 
grassroots NGOs rely on funding from abroad, these groups now 
face new administrative hurdles, increased government scrutiny, 
and the potential loss of funding. This comes at a time when 
the space for civil society, particularly any form of rights 
advocacy, is already fraught following high-profile crackdowns 
on NGOs and rights advocates in recent years.
    Similar realities emerged surrounding the PRC Cybersecurity 
Law, with foreign companies expressing concern over data 
localization requirements, compromised security, privacy 
safeguards, and discriminatory treatment. While the full 
implications of the law are still unclear, provisions within 
the law could give the Chinese government unprecedented access 
to the technology and data of foreign companies, in part 
through requiring companies to store their data on mainland 
Chinese servers, an alarming proposition for businesses given 
the Chinese government's track record of ineffective protection 
of intellectual property rights. Chinese citizens, too, will 
feel the impact of the law, as it lacks any guarantee to 
protect the right to freedom of expression, and requires real-
name registration and storage of personal information, making 
users more vulnerable to censorship and prosecution. As 
written, the law could result in foreign companies being forced 
to choose between aiding Chinese security agencies in their 
repression and breaking the law.
                Rights Lawyers Tortured and Criminalized
    In a March 2017 annual report, Zhou Qiang, President of the 
Supreme People's Court (SPC), touted the conviction and 
sentencing of prominent rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng as a key 
achievement of the Chinese judiciary in 2016. Zhou Shifeng and 
other lawyers from the Fengrui Law Firm, including Wang 
Quanzhang and Wang Yu, were the focus of the government's July 
2015 crackdown on human rights lawyers and advocates. These 
lawyers and advocates were involved in cases which the Party 
deemed sensitive, representing practitioners of the Falun Gong 
spiritual movement, ethnic rights advocates, and individuals 
detained for alleged speech crimes. In the March report, the 
SPC President urged high court presidents across China to 
``draw your sword'' (liangjian) against Western principles of 
``constitutional democracy, separation of powers, and judicial 
independence.'' This language is consistent with broader Party 
efforts to fuel nationalist sentiment with an undercurrent of 
anti-Western hostility spurred by propaganda campaigns against 
``foreign forces'' and increasing official rhetoric 
characterizing rights lawyers as ``enemies of the state.''
    Authorities used vague state security provisions in the PRC 
Criminal Law to deny due process rights, including access to 
independent legal counsel, in prosecuting several of the rights 
lawyers detained in connection with the July 2015 crackdown. 
Many of these lawyers were initially held under a relatively 
new form of de facto incommunicado detention--``residential 
surveillance at a designated location''--which allows for 
detention in a secret location without access to a lawyer for 
up to six months, leaving detainees at risk of torture. Reports 
of severe mistreatment emerged in connection with several of 
these cases, including forced ingestion of unknown medications 
and the use of electric shock. Some rights lawyers preemptively 
recorded or authored statements of denial of forced or coerced 
confessions, in what observers described as an astute tactic to 
recapture the narrative from their accusers. In a January 2017 
written statement, prominent human rights lawyer Xie Yang said: 
``If, one day in the future, I do confess--whether in writing 
or on camera or on tape--that will not be the true expression 
of my own mind. It may be because I've been subjected to 
prolonged torture, or because I've been offered the chance to 
be released on bail . . ..'' \2\
    Chinese government and Communist Party officials use 
various other methods to restrict and punish lawyers who take 
on cases officials deem ``sensitive.'' When lawyers are 
convicted of criminal activity, as is the case for numerous 
prominent rights lawyers, officials may strip them of their law 
licenses, subject them to constant surveillance, and curtail 
their freedom of movement. Amended regulations that took effect 
in November 2016, requiring law firms to establish internal 
Party groups that will take part in the law firms' management, 
may further hinder even licensed lawyers' ability to take on 
cases the government deems ``sensitive.''
    Prior to the 2015 crackdown, officials employed similar 
measures to restrict and punish prominent rights lawyers. Many 
of these people continue to suffer for their advocacy, as 
represented in the cases of the following individuals:
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Jiang Tianyong was disbarred in 2009 after 
        representing individuals such as Tibetan protesters and 
        victims of the 2008 contaminated milk powder scandal. 
        He disappeared in November 2016 and was formally 
        arrested six months later on charges of ``subversion of 
        state power.'' In August 2017, Jiang pleaded guilty to 
        ``inciting subversion of state power'' at trial.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Public interest lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, who had 
        advocated on behalf of religious and ethnic minorities, 
        engaged in activities commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen 
        protests, and represented defendants in politically 
        sensitive cases, such as artist Ai Weiwei, was given a 
        three-year suspended sentence in December 2015, 
        following 19 months in pretrial detention. Pu 
        permanently lost his law license as a result of his 
        conviction.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Ni Yulan, severely disabled after police beat 
        her while in detention, lost her job as a legal 
        consultant in 2002 as a result of her advocacy on 
        behalf of individuals forcibly evicted from their 
        homes. In 2016, Chinese authorities denied Ni a 
        passport to prevent her from traveling to the United 
        States to accept an award from the U.S. Department of 
        State honoring her courage and unstinting advocacy. 
        More recently, she has been repeatedly evicted from 
        rented apartments after police reportedly pressured her 
        landlords.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Gao Zhisheng, one of China's first rights 
        lawyers representing vulnerable groups such as house 
        church Christians, Falun Gong practitioners, and 
        farmers whose land was expropriated, was released from 
        prison in August 2014, after enduring severe torture. 
        Unable to practice law due to his criminal conviction, 
        he faces continued restrictions on his freedom of 
        movement and speech. As of August 2017, Gao is 
        reportedly missing.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Tang Jingling, who gained prominence as a 
        lawyer working on compensation and corruption cases, 
        has been prevented from practicing law since late 2005. 
        Officials detained him in 2014, prior to the 25th 
        anniversary of the violent suppression of the 1989 
        Tiananmen protests, and in January 2016 sentenced him 
        to five years in prison for ``inciting subversion of 
        state power.''
   Restrictions on Religious Freedom Intensify, Particularly in the 
     Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and Tibetan Autonomous Areas
    In both law and practice, the Chinese government continued 
to violate the religious freedom of its citizens by imposing 
restrictions on religious practice and interpretations of 
faith--restrictions that have intensified since Xi Jinping 
became Communist Party General Secretary in November 2012. 
These abuses were especially severe in ethnic minority areas. 
Revised draft regulations governing religious activities and 
assembly, issued in September 2016 and passed in September 
2017, did not reflect any lifting of past repression, but were 
a systematization of existing restrictions and an example of 
the Party's attempts to coopt what it perceives to be the 
positive aspects of religion--namely, provision of social 
services and religion as an instrument for promoting national 
unity and social stability.
    Anticipating passage of the draft regulations, some local 
government measures targeted Protestant Christian house 
churches. These included the establishment of work plans to 
force house churches to register or face closure; investigative 
surveys; mobilization of security forces against privately 
organized churches; surveillance of churches through informants 
and the installation of cameras; destruction of religious 
symbols, including crosses; dismissal of personnel; and 
prohibitions on offering boxes, performing baptisms, and 
appointing ministers.
    In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), officials 
introduced policies regulating some of the most personal 
expressions of Uyghur Muslims' religious faith, including 
circumcisions, weddings, and funerals. Authorities adopted new 
regulations limiting the role of religion in education as well 
as parents' ability to involve their children in religious 
activities. The regulations also banned Islamic dress, 
including veils and ``irregular'' beards, and prohibited 
parents from naming their infant children any of a list of 
dozens of ``Islamic'' names deemed ``extremist.'' Families who 
failed to comply with the name prohibition risked denial of 
household registration (hukou) for their newborns, thereby 
restricting their access to social services such as education 
and healthcare. Later reports indicated that the name 
prohibition was extended to include anyone up to the age of 16. 
In late 2016, authorities reportedly demolished thousands of 
mosques in the XUAR as part of a ``mosque rectification'' 
campaign introduced by central government officials and 
overseen by local security personnel.
    In Tibetan autonomous areas, the Party and government 
continued to violate the rights of religious freedom and 
freedom of movement of Tibetan Buddhist monastics and laypeople 
through a system of pervasive controls and restrictions on 
religious practice, and through extensive and intrusive 
surveillance that deepened the Party's penetration into 
villages and religious institutions. The demolitions of 
buildings and the expulsion and forced relocation of thousands 
of monks and nuns from the renowned Buddhist institutes of 
learning Larung Gar and Yachen Gar, both in Sichuan province, 
further eroded institutions that serve to preserve Tibetan 
Buddhism, language, and culture. As of August 2017, there were 
five known self-immolations of Tibetans protesting Chinese rule 
and calling for the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet during 
this reporting year. An estimated 7,000 Tibetan pilgrims from 
Tibetan areas of China attempted to attend an important 
religious teaching in India given by the Dalai Lama in January 
2017. In advance of the teaching in India, however, Chinese 
officials confiscated Tibetans' passports, ordered thousands of 
Tibetans who were already in India to return to China, and 
issued threats--including detention, loss of pension and jobs, 
and prohibiting monks from returning to their monasteries--if 
they failed to obey the order to return.
 Long-Term Viability of ``One Country, Two Systems'' for Hong Kong Is 
                         Increasingly Uncertain
    Against the backdrop of the 20th anniversary of the British 
handover of Hong Kong, the Commission observed further erosion 
of the ``one country, two systems'' principle enshrined in Hong 
Kong's Basic Law. The National People's Congress Standing 
Committee (NPCSC) chose to intervene in an active Hong Kong 
court case in November 2016, interpreting the Basic Law to 
effectively prohibit two democratically elected Hong Kong 
legislators from taking office in the Legislative Council 
(LegCo). It was the first time the NPCSC had preemptively ruled 
on a case under consideration by a local court, raising further 
concerns about Hong Kong's autonomy.
    The March 26, 2017, election of Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor 
as Hong Kong's fourth Chief Executive was marred by reports of 
Chinese central government officials and representatives 
instructing Election Committee members to support Lam over 
other candidates. The composition of the Election Committee, 
which is already restricted to ensure support for candidates 
approved by Chinese authorities, underscored the unmet demands 
of the 2014 protests calling for universal suffrage and fully 
democratic representation.
    The May 2017 statements of Zhang Dejiang, NPCSC chairman 
and head of the Party's coordination group on Hong Kong 
affairs, further expounded on the central government's views 
regarding the long-term trajectory of Hong Kong with an ominous 
warning: ``Under no condition should the high degree of 
autonomy be used as a guise to confront the Central 
Government's authority.'' He underscored the primacy of Hong 
Kong's Chief Executive over the judiciary and the legislature, 
and pressed for more stringent national security laws in Hong 
Kong, including the reintroduction of the controversial anti-
subversion and anti-sedition legislation under Article 23 of 
the Basic Law.
    In July 2017, a local court removed four democratically 
elected pro-democracy legislators on grounds that they had 
failed to take the oath of office properly, based on the same 
controversial interpretation of the Basic Law used to prevent 
two lawmakers from taking office in November 2016. Nathan Law 
Kwun-chung, one of the leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy 
protest and the youngest elected legislator in Hong Kong's 
history, was among those removed from office. Hong Kong 
authorities sentenced Law and two other leaders of the 2014 
protest, Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Alex Chow Yong-kang, in 
August 2017, to between six and eight months' imprisonment in 
connection with their activities during the 2014 protests. The 
Hong Kong Department of Justice pursued the harsher sentences 
after Wong and Law had previously been sentenced to, and 
completed, community service. Moreover, the new prison 
sentences prevent each one of the three from running for 
legislative office for five years. Their newly formed political 
party, Demosisto, issued a statement in response to the 
sentencing: ``The government is determined to put peaceful 
protestors behind bars to mute all dissidents by abusing 
judicial procedures.'' \3\
    Additionally, Hong Kong journalists reported continuing 
fears over press freedom, noting concerns over self-censorship, 
government restrictions on reporters, and the 2015 abductions 
and disappearances of five Hong Kong booksellers by mainland 
Chinese authorities. In May 2017 testimony before the 
Commission, bookseller Lam Wing Kee described the events 
surrounding the disappearances of the booksellers, including 
Gui Minhai, who remains in detention as of September 2017: 
``This string of events demonstrates not only brutal 
intervention in the freedom of expression in Hong Kong by the 
Chinese government, but also how increasingly unscrupulous they 
are.'' \4\
                                                Executive 
                                                Summary
                                                     Executive 
                                                        Summary
           Recommendations to Congress and the Administration
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Embed Human Rights Throughout Bilateral Relations. 
The Administration and Congress should develop an action plan 
to facilitate interagency coordination on human rights in China 
and develop a coordinated approach that prepares all agencies 
interacting with Chinese government counterparts to pursue 
measurable, results-oriented human rights and rule of law 
outcomes. All agencies should be prepared to better articulate 
the link between human rights improvements in China and U.S. 
economic, security, and diplomatic interests.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Make Reciprocity a Priority. The Administration 
should open high-level discussions to create a rules-of-the-
road agreement that ensures reciprocal treatment for U.S. 
institutions, businesses, and nationals operating in China. The 
Administration should take appropriate and reciprocal actions 
to ensure that U.S.-based media outlets as well as academic and 
non-governmental organizations have the same freedoms afforded 
to a growing number of Chinese government-sponsored and funded 
think tanks, academic institutions, and media entities in the 
United States, while ensuring that independent Chinese media 
and organizations remain welcome. In addition, any bilateral 
investment treaty (BIT) with China should effectively 
facilitate and enable market access for U.S. media companies 
and education institutions.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Hold Officials Accountable for Abuses. The 
Administration should use existing laws to hold accountable 
Chinese government officials and others complicit in torture, 
severe religious freedom restrictions, repatriation of North 
Korean refugees, or those participating in forced abortions or 
sterilizations, including by using the sanctions available in 
the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, the 
International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, and the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act of 2000. Congress should consider 
allocating resources to identify and investigate Chinese 
government officials responsible for human rights violations.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Seek a Law Enforcement Agreement That Upholds 
Global Standards. Chinese government officials have sought 
repatriation of Chinese citizens overseas in connection with 
the government's anticorruption investigations, offering the 
Administration an opportunity to press for a comprehensive law 
enforcement agreement that establishes diplomatic assurances 
guaranteeing verifiable prisoner due process protections and an 
end to torture in detention and forms of arbitrary detention, 
including ``residential surveillance at a designated 
location.'' The U.S. Government should not agree to any 
additional repatriations until the Chinese government can 
demonstrate that they are meeting the standards set forth in 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
other international human rights instruments regarding the 
treatment of criminal suspects.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Respond to Digital Protectionism. The 
Administration should consider seeking a high-level trade 
agreement to address the Chinese government's growing digital 
protectionism that would include commitments on the free flow 
of news and information and the non-discriminatory treatment of 
U.S. digital products. The Administration should consider 
initiating a World Trade Organization dispute to challenge 
continued discrimination against U.S. technology and media 
companies and prepare targeted trade sanctions if the Chinese 
government continues to impose onerous requirements, including 
data storage in China and the disclosure of source code and 
encryption keys. The Administration should provide Congress 
more detailed information about the effects of Internet 
censorship on U.S. businesses in China and use existing legal 
provisions to address intellectual property theft and the 
privacy concerns of U.S. citizens due to Chinese cyber 
espionage. The Administration and the committees of 
jurisdiction in Congress should work to find ways to use the 
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to 
respond to unfair industrial policies that threaten national 
security, including by expanding its mandate to look at foreign 
investment in media and technology sectors.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Promote a Free Internet. The Administration, in 
collaboration with Congress and the Chief Executive Officer of 
the Broadcasting Board of Governors, should develop a 
comprehensive, multiyear strategy that partners with civil 
society, businesses, key technology industries, religious 
leaders, and human rights defenders to counter efforts by the 
Chinese government to promote ``Internet sovereignty''; develop 
effective technologies that provide or enhance access to the 
Internet; and conduct research on ways to counter threats to 
Internet freedom, including the Chinese government's intent to 
block access to virtual private networks (VPNs) starting in 
early 2018. The Administration and Congress should consider 
expanding programs providing digital security training for 
civil society advocates and projects that track, preserve, and 
recirculate media and Internet content deleted by Chinese 
government censors.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Expand Mandate of FARA To Counter Propaganda. The 
Administration and Congress should work together to expand the 
mandate of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) to 
encompass individuals working for foreign state-owned media, 
government-backed think tanks, or other non-profit 
organizations operating in the United States. In addition, the 
Administration should develop a ``whole-of-government'' 
strategy to respond to Chinese government propaganda, including 
by fully equipping the Global Engagement Center at the State 
Department to research and counter disinformation and by 
considering an expansion of resources for Voice of America and 
Radio Free Asia programming in China.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Speak With a Unified Voice on Human Rights. The 
Administration should, where appropriate, lead efforts with 
allies to develop coordinated responses to human rights 
violations, including by working together at the United 
Nations, by creating a multilateral human rights dialogue or 
jointly funding technical assistance and capacity-building 
projects, or by engaging in joint advocacy and the sharing of 
prisoner lists. The Administration should also coordinate with 
businesses and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to develop 
a unified message about unfair industrial policies, digital 
protectionism, and the harm to U.S. and global interests from 
the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs' Activities.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Help Address China's ``Missing Girls'' Problem. 
The Administration should integrate the provisions of the Girls 
Count Act (Public Law No. 114-24) into foreign assistance 
programs and consider appointing a Special Advisor at the U.S. 
State Department to oversee the creation and coordination of 
assistance programs to address the social and economic issues 
created by the Chinese government's population control policies 
and sex ratio imbalances, particularly projects that strengthen 
property and inheritance rights for Chinese women and girls and 
those that protect women and their families from the most 
coercive aspects of the population control policies. The 
Administration should develop talking points so that officials 
and diplomats can discuss problems linked to China's dramatic 
sex ratio imbalance as part of bilateral dialogues on security, 
law, trafficking, human rights, and public health. In addition, 
Congress should continue to link U.S. contributions to the UN 
Population Fund for use in China with the end of all birth 
limitation and coercive population control policies in China.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Seek Protections for North Korean Refugees. 
Congress should reauthorize the North Korean Human Rights Act 
and consider expanding efforts to channel uncensored news and 
information into North Korea and to asylum-seekers in China 
through all possible means, including through North Korean 
defector communities. In addition, using the tools provided by 
Congress, the Administration should be prepared to impose 
secondary sanctions on Chinese corporations, individuals, or 
banks that profit from North Korean forced labor and those 
assisting the North Korean government in avoiding international 
sanctions.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Make Religious Freedom Diplomacy a Priority. Given 
that countries that severely restrict religious freedom are 
likely to face domestic instability and may also threaten 
regional stability, it is in the U.S. interest for the 
Administration to implement fully the provisions of the Frank 
R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act (Public Law No. 
114-281) and strategically employ the sanctions and other tools 
associated with the U.S. State Department's designation of 
China as a ``Country of Particular Concern'' for severe 
restrictions on religious freedom. The Administration should 
reestablish the Religion and Foreign Policy Working Group 
within the Department of State's Federal Advisory Committee to 
bring together experts from government, universities, religious 
and other NGOs to develop an effective multiyear plan to 
promote and protect religious freedom in China.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Prioritize Efforts To Combat Human Trafficking, 
Forced Labor, and Child Labor. Congress and the Administration 
should ensure that the U.S. Department of State's Office to 
Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons and the U.S. 
Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs 
have sufficient resources and status within their Departments 
to effectively combat human trafficking and more accurately 
report on current conditions, including by reauthorizing the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. Congress should 
again consider legislation that improves U.S. Government data 
collection and reporting on the issue of human trafficking for 
the purpose of organ removal, globally and in China.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Promote Dialogue Regarding Tibet. The 
Administration and Congress should work together to press for 
unrestricted access to Tibetan autonomous areas in China and to 
facilitate the full implementation of the Tibetan Policy Act of 
2002, including establishing a diplomatic office in Lhasa, and 
urging renewed dialogue between Chinese government officials 
and the Dalai Lama's representatives. Administration officials, 
including the President, should meet with the Dalai Lama in his 
capacity as a spiritual leader and with the leaders of the 
Central Tibetan Administration. Congress should consider 
passage of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act (S. 821/H.R. 
1872, 115th Cong., 1st Sess.).
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Calibrate Counterterrorism Cooperation To Protect 
Ethnic Minorities. Due to the Chinese government's practice of 
labeling peaceful rights advocates and members of religious and 
ethnic minority groups as extremists or terrorists, the 
Administration should consider carefully the nature and scope 
of its counterterrorism cooperation with the Chinese government 
and, through the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence, create guidelines for such cooperation to ensure 
that the United States does not condone Chinese authorities' 
crackdown on domestic political dissent or restrictions on the 
freedoms of expression or religion. The Administration should 
develop interagency talking points to raise issues of human 
rights in China's ethnic minority areas during bilateral and 
multilateral dialogues with Chinese military, public security, 
or other appropriate government officials.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Ensure American Nationals Are Protected. The 
Administration should consider seeking revisions to the U.S.-
China Consular Convention to clarify that Americans detained in 
China may meet with a lawyer of their choice, contact their 
families regularly, privately discuss the details of their case 
with U.S. consular officials, and have U.S. Embassy officials 
attend all legal proceedings. The Administration should 
consider developing a formal strategy to secure the release of 
American nationals and the family members of American nationals 
who are extrajudicially detained in China and should work with 
Congress to ensure regular reports on the number of U.S. 
citizens detained or not permitted to leave China.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Reiterate U.S. Interest in Hong Kong's Autonomy. 
The Administration should continue to issue annually the report 
outlined in Section 301 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy 
Act of 1992, subject to Congressional directives. Congress 
should consider ways to express through public statements, 
official visits, and resolutions the important connection 
between a free press, a vibrant civil society, an independent 
judiciary, and expanded democratic governance in Hong Kong and 
the mutual interests shared by the United States and China in 
maintaining Hong Kong as a center of business and finance in 
Asia. The Administration and Congress should work together to 
determine whether legislation or other measures are needed to 
revise the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, 
including by passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy 
Act (S. 417, 115th Cong., 1st Sess.).
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Develop a Code of Conduct for Civil Society. The 
Administration should work with U.S. civil society and non-
governmental organizations, including cultural-exchange and 
sister-city programs, and humanitarian assistance, academic, 
and religious organizations, to formulate a code of conduct for 
interacting with the Chinese government in order to protect the 
academic freedom and universally recognized human rights of 
staff, faculty, or students living in China and to equip 
institutions to respond effectively when Chinese authorities 
attempt to encourage censorship, threaten visa denials or 
access to China, or dictate who can participate or what can be 
discussed in various programs, projects, or institutions.
    &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Consistently Advocate for Political Prisoners. In 
meetings with Chinese government officials, Administration 
officials and Members of Congress should raise cases, both 
publicly and in private, of individuals detained or imprisoned 
for the peaceful expression of political or religious beliefs 
and those promoting legal reforms and human rights. The 
Administration should also consider creating a Special Advisor 
for Political and Religious Prisoners to coordinate State 
Department and interagency advocacy on behalf of political 
prisoners. Experience demonstrates that raising individual 
cases can result in improved treatment, lighter sentences, or 
in some cases, release from custody, detention, or 
imprisonment. U.S. officials are encouraged to consult the 
Commission's Political Prisoner Database for credible and up-
to-date information on individual prisoners or groups of 
prisoners. Please see representative cases of concern on the 
following pages.

                 Specific Findings and Recommendations
    A summary of specific findings follows below for each 
section of this Annual Report, covering each area that the 
Commission monitors. In each area, the Commission has 
identified a set of issues that merit attention over the next 
year, and, in accordance with the Commission's legislative 
mandate, submits for each a set of recommendations to the 
President and the Congress for legislative or executive action.
                         Freedom of Expression
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Imprisoned writer Liu Xiaobo--an advocate of 
        democracy and non-violent political reform and China's 
        only Nobel Peace Prize laureate--died of liver cancer 
        on July 13, 2017, in Shenyang municipality, Liaoning 
        province, on medical parole. In the nine years prior to 
        his death, he spent one year in pretrial detention and 
        nearly eight years in prison on the charge of 
        ``inciting subversion of state power'' for his 
        coauthorship of the political treatise Charter 08 and 
        several essays critical of the Chinese Communist Party 
        and government. The government and Party continued to 
        isolate his wife Liu Xia in extralegal confinement 
        after his death, a condition that Chinese authorities 
        imposed on her starting in October 2010, when the 
        Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that it would award 
        the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The government and Party continued to stress 
        the need for ideological discipline from news media and 
        journalists, in particular that the media function as a 
        ``mouthpiece'' for the Party. At a November 2016 
        meeting with the All-China Journalists Association 
        (ACJA), President and Party General Secretary Xi 
        Jinping urged media workers to ``embody the principle 
        of Party character'' and ``be reliable for the Party 
        and the people.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Official news media continued to publish 
        articles about human rights lawyers as part of the 
        government and Party's ongoing crackdown on human 
        rights lawyers and advocates that began in and around 
        July 2015. Articles in the Global Times, The Paper, 
        Legal Daily, and Procuratorial Daily ascribed a litany 
        of criminal offenses to disbarred lawyer Jiang 
        Tianyong, including an assertion that he fabricated the 
        torture allegations of fellow rights lawyer Xie Yang.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Pervasive government and Party censorship 
        contributed to the shrinking space for journalism and 
        public debate, demonstrated by the closure of the 
        reform-minded journal Yanhuang Chunqiu; the suspension 
        of Consensus, a website known for open discussion and 
        commentary; the shutdown of the economic think tank 
        Unirule's website; and the two-month suspension in 
        October 2016 of Caixin news articles for republication.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Several Chinese journalists and media outlets 
        argued for the protection of journalists' physical 
        safety, government accountability, and guarantees of 
        their right to report on events in the public interest 
        following incidents of physical violence against and 
        obstruction of domestic Chinese journalists on 
        assignment this past year.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The government targeted citizen journalists 
        for prosecution this past year. In August 2017, 
        authorities sentenced Lu Yuyu, the founder of ``Not the 
        News''--a blog that published information on mass 
        incidents relating primarily to labor protests--to four 
        years in prison. In November 2016, authorities detained 
        Liu Feiyue and Huang Qi, founders of websites that 
        featured news from citizen journalists, and arrested 
        them in December, demonstrating the government's drive 
        ``to criminalize those who document human rights abuses 
        and advocate for better human rights protections,'' 
        according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Foreign journalists continued to face 
        obstruction and harassment in their efforts to report 
        in China, including detention, physical abuse, 
        surveillance and restricted access, and visa renewal 
        challenges. The government blocked some international 
        news media, websites, and social media applications 
        (apps) within China. Chinese citizens who spoke with 
        foreign journalists were at risk of punishment such as 
        imprisonment, detention, travel denial, and dismissal 
        from organizations.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government's Internet and social 
        media policies are aimed at controlling the flow of 
        information, which a U.S.-based expert said, ``guides 
        the narrative in the direction that the state 
        determines.'' Citizen Lab, an information technology 
        and human rights research center, published findings on 
        Chinese government content filtering of social media 
        platforms WeChat and Weibo, observing a high level of 
        flexibility and speed in response to issues and events 
        deemed politically sensitive, such as the death of Liu 
        Xiaobo, the names of detained human rights lawyers, and 
        a Tibetan Buddhist teaching held in January 2017.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; This past year, authorities developed judicial 
        and legislative approaches to protect the ``national 
        historical narrative'' and took punitive action against 
        Chinese officials, academics, and journalists, for 
        speech critical of President and Party General 
        Secretary Xi Jinping, former leader Mao Zedong, and 
        political campaigns and incidents from modern Chinese 
        history. Authorities also detained and imprisoned 
        several citizens who criticized Xi and Mao, some using 
        censorship circumvention hardware and software to post 
        or repost their comments outside the Chinese 
        government's system of surveillance and censorship 
        (commonly known as the Great Firewall).
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Give greater public expression, including at the 
        highest levels of the U.S. Government, to the issue of 
        press freedom in China, condemning the harassment and 
        detention of both domestic and foreign journalists; the 
        denial, threat of denial, or delay of visas for foreign 
        journalists; and the censoring or blockage of foreign 
        media websites. Consistently link press freedoms to 
        U.S. interests, noting how censorship and restrictions 
        on journalists and media websites prevent the free flow 
        of information on issues of public concern, including 
        public health and environmental crises, food safety 
        problems, and corruption, and act as a trade barrier 
        for foreign media and companies attempting to access 
        the Chinese market. Raise these issues with Chinese 
        officials during bilateral dialogues. Assess the extent 
        to which China's treatment of foreign journalists 
        contravenes its World Trade Organization or other 
        obligations.
          Sustain, and where appropriate expand, programs that 
        develop and widely distribute technologies that will 
        assist Chinese human rights advocates and civil society 
        organizations in circumventing Internet restrictions, 
        in order to access and share content protected under 
        international human rights standards. Continue to 
        maintain Internet freedom programs for China at the 
        U.S. Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of 
        Governors to provide digital security training and 
        capacity-building efforts for bloggers, journalists, 
        civil society organizations, and human rights and 
        Internet freedom advocates in China.
          Raise with Chinese officials, during all appropriate 
        bilateral discussions, the costs to U.S.-China 
        relations and to the Chinese public's confidence in 
        government institutions that are incurred when the 
        Chinese government restricts political debate, advocacy 
        for democracy or human rights, and other forms of 
        peaceful political expression. Emphasize that such 
        restrictions exceed international standards for 
        restrictions on free expression, particularly those 
        contained in Article 19 of the International Covenant 
        on Civil and Political Rights and Article 19 of the 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Emphasize that 
        such restrictions erode confidence in media and 
        government institutions. Submit questions for China's 
        next UN Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review, 
        asking China to explain what steps it will take to 
        ensure its restrictions on free expression conform to 
        international standards.
          Urge Chinese officials to end unlawful detention and 
        official harassment of Chinese rights advocates, 
        lawyers, and journalists subject to reprisal for 
        exercising their right to freedom of expression. Call 
        on officials to end the illegal home confinement of Liu 
        Xia, the wife of the late Nobel Peace Prize laureate 
        Liu Xiaobo, and release or confirm the release of 
        individuals detained or imprisoned for exercising 
        freedom of expression, such as Lu Yuyu, Liu Feiyue, 
        Huang Qi, Wang Jing, Yang Xiuqiong, Zhang Haitao, Tashi 
        Wangchug, Wang Jiangfeng, Kwon Pyong, and other 
        political prisoners raised in this report and in the 
        Commission's Political Prisoner Database. Raise this 
        issue in bilateral dialogues as well as through 
        multilateral institutions, such as the UN Human Rights 
        Council and its Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.
                             Worker Rights
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government- and Communist Party-
        controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) 
        remains the only trade union organization permitted 
        under Chinese law, and Chinese labor advocates and 
        international observers report that the ACFTU does not 
        effectively represent workers' rights and interests. 
        Chinese workers' right to collective bargaining remains 
        limited in law and in practice.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Labor advocates and non-governmental 
        organizations (NGOs) reportedly continued to face 
        surveillance and pressure from authorities this past 
        year, following a December 2015 crackdown on Chinese 
        labor advocates and NGOs in Guangdong province that 
        domestic and international observers described as 
        ``unprecedented.'' The detention and sentencing of 
        labor advocates amidst that crackdown reportedly has 
        had a chilling effect on labor NGOs, affecting 
        collective bargaining work in particular. In May 2017, 
        authorities in Jiangxi province detained three Chinese 
        men who were conducting research on behalf of a U.S.-
        based labor NGO regarding working conditions in 
        factories producing shoes for international brands. 
        Authorities released them on bail in June. In addition, 
        the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs' 
        Activities, which took effect on January 1, 2017, may 
        further hinder the work of labor NGOs in China, as many 
        of them rely on sources of funding outside of mainland 
        China.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Following reports of a significant increase in 
        worker strikes and protests in the previous reporting 
        year, the number of worker actions appeared to remain 
        high this past year, though the Commission did not 
        observe reliable statistics. China Labour Bulletin data 
        indicate that government responses to worker strikes 
        and protests were mixed, ranging from assisting with 
        workplace negotiations to violent police intervention. 
        Some labor advocates asserted that the government's 
        suppression of strikes had increased. Labor advocates 
        also noted increasing difficulty in finding information 
        on strikes in China due to the chilling effect of the 
        December 2015 crackdown on labor NGOs and tightening 
        government control of the media.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Commission continued to observe reports of 
        the use of child labor in China this past year. In one 
        widely reported case, Party-run media revealed that 
        clothing manufacturers in Jiangsu province had hired 
        workers from Yunnan province through recruiters, and 
        many of the workers were under the age of 16. According 
        to the report, employers beat the children for working 
        too slowly and withheld pay and identification 
        documents to prevent them from quitting. Such actions 
        are indicators of forced labor, according to the 
        International Labour Organization.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During this reporting year, government data 
        showed a continued decline in both workplace accidents 
        and deaths, though the Commission continued to observe 
        reports of lax enforcement of work safety laws and 
        regulations. The Commission did not observe officially 
        published statistics for occupational illness for 2015 
        or 2016. This past year, the government issued several 
        documents setting targets and outlining plans for 
        improving occupational health and safety.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Many categories of workers were unable to 
        benefit fully from the protections provided under 
        Chinese law, including workers above the retirement 
        age, student workers and interns, and independent 
        contractors or informal workers. During this reporting 
        year, the Commission continued to observe reports of 
        the mistreatment of dispatch laborers--workers hired 
        through subcontracting agencies--in violation of 
        domestic laws and regulations meant to prevent such 
        abuses. Moreover, firms reportedly used ``outsourced 
        labor,'' another form of subcontracted labor, to get 
        around new regulations on dispatch labor.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Call on the Chinese government to exonerate labor 
        rights advocates Meng Han, Zeng Feiyang, Zhu Xiaomei, 
        and Tang Jian. Raise their cases in public and private 
        meetings with Chinese officials, and urge Chinese 
        officials to allow these advocates to continue their 
        work for labor NGOs. Encourage authorities to cooperate 
        with labor NGOs, noting the positive role such 
        organizations play in encouraging workers to address 
        their grievances peacefully and through legal channels.
          Call on the Chinese government to respect 
        internationally recognized rights to freedom of 
        association and collective bargaining, and allow 
        workers to organize and establish truly independent 
        labor unions. Convey support in all appropriate 
        bilateral and multilateral dialogues for genuine 
        collective bargaining and direct elections of trade 
        union representatives, emphasizing that increased 
        worker representation can be beneficial for resolving 
        workplace grievances and preventing strikes and unrest.
          In meetings with Chinese officials, highlight the 
        September 2016 report of Maina Kiai, the former UN 
        Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
        assembly and of association, which emphasizes that 
        labor rights are workers' human rights, and that the 
        failure to protect or enforce these rights 
        ``exacerbates global inequality, poverty, violence and 
        child and forced labour.''
          Encourage Chinese officials through all appropriate 
        bilateral discussions to publish information on 
        measures taken to prevent the employment of children 
        under the age of 16. Call on the Chinese government to 
        collect and publish detailed statistical data on 
        working children, including on child labor and 
        hazardous work, in order to better understand the 
        prevalence and nature of child labor in China and to 
        effectively target efforts to address this problem.
          Promote and support bilateral, multilateral, and 
        multistakeholder exchanges among government officials, 
        academics, legal experts, and civil society groups to 
        focus on labor issues such as collective bargaining, 
        employment discrimination, and occupational health and 
        safety, particularly prevention of pneumoconiosis. Seek 
        opportunities to support capacity-building programs to 
        strengthen Chinese labor and legal aid organizations 
        involved in defending the rights of workers.
          When appropriate, integrate meaningful civil society 
        participation into bilateral and multilateral 
        dialogues, meetings, and exchanges. Invite 
        international unions and labor NGOs as well as domestic 
        civil society groups from all participating countries 
        to observe and contribute to relevant government-to-
        government dialogues, particularly those relating to 
        trade. Although participation of the All-China 
        Federation of Trade Unions or Chinese government-
        organized NGOs (GONGOs) may be constructive in some 
        cases, ensure such organizations are not treated as 
        independent civil society groups.
          Support China's increased engagement and cooperation 
        with the International Labour Organization (ILO) 
        through funding for ILO technical cooperation projects 
        with China. Request that the ILO increase its work with 
        China on observing core labor standards, including 
        freedom of association and the right to organize.
                            Criminal Justice
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During the 2017 reporting year, the Commission 
        observed continued reports of the Chinese government 
        using ``black jails'' and other extralegal and 
        extrajudicial measures to arbitrarily detain 
        individuals in violation of international human rights 
        standards. After the Chinese government abolished the 
        reeducation through labor system in 2013, Chinese 
        officials reportedly have continued to use ``black 
        jails''--detention sites that operate outside of 
        China's judicial and administrative detention systems--
        to suppress individuals such as petitioners, rights 
        advocates, and religious practitioners.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government continued to apply 
        broadly defined criminal provisions such as ``picking 
        quarrels and provoking trouble'' and ``gathering a 
        crowd to disturb order in a public place'' to punish 
        petitioners, rights advocates, lawyers, and ethnic 
        minorities for the peaceful exercise of their rights.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The government emphasized the procuratorate's 
        supervisory role over criminal investigations and 
        continued to improve implementation of existing legal 
        provisions that address the problem of investigators' 
        use of coercion and overreliance on confession. Despite 
        official pronouncements, reports of coerced confession 
        continued to emerge this past year, with some 
        indicating that procurators participated in the 
        practice.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Authorities continued to charge citizens with 
        ``endangering state security'' offenses. This is one of 
        three categories of crimes in the PRC Criminal Law 
        permitting the application of a coercive measure known 
        as ``residential surveillance at a designated 
        location,'' which can amount to incommunicado detention 
        for up to six months. In one such example, authorities 
        detained disbarred rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong without 
        providing notice to his family within the required 
        timeframe. The location of Jiang's detention remained 
        unknown for over six months.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; This past year, the government denied access 
        to legal counsel to some individuals detained in 
        politically sensitive cases, such as those detained in 
        the crackdown against rights lawyers and advocates that 
        began in and around July 2015. Reports also show that 
        authorities harassed or intimidated defense lawyers by 
        means including detention and search and seizure of 
        their personal belongings.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Multiple reports of torture and abuse surfaced 
        this past year. Authorities reportedly tortured or 
        abused rights lawyers Xie Yang, Li Chunfu, Li Heping, 
        Wang Quanzhang, and rights advocate Wu Gan, all of whom 
        authorities detained in the crackdown that began in or 
        around July 2015. The Commission did not observe 
        reports of authorities holding criminally accountable 
        the perpetrators of abuse in these cases. In 
        particular, authorities in Xie Yang's case claimed that 
        the accounts of torture were fabricated. In the case of 
        Lei Yang, a resident of Beijing municipality who died 
        shortly after police took him into custody in May 2016, 
        procuratorate officials decided in December 2016 not to 
        prosecute the police officers who perpetrated fatal 
        physical violence against Lei.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The judiciary overturned 11 cases of wrongful 
        conviction in 2016. In one of these cases, judicial 
        reexamination commenced long after the execution of the 
        wrongfully convicted person, prompted by someone coming 
        forward who took responsibility for the crimes. The 
        court declined to make a finding of confession by 
        torture, which a legal expert said remains a 
        predominant cause of wrongful convictions.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the Supreme 
        People's Court regaining exclusive authority to review 
        death sentences, but a uniform standard of review 
        remained lacking. The government continued to treat the 
        number of executions as a state secret. Some observers 
        estimate the annual number to be in the thousands, 
        exceeding the number for all other countries combined. 
        Despite a purported ban on harvesting organs from 
        executed prisoners, a senior Chinese health official 
        admitted that the practice continued in at least one 
        case during this reporting year.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Raise with Chinese officials, during all appropriate 
        bilateral discussions, individual cases where officials 
        have used the investigation of alleged criminal 
        activity to target government critics and rights 
        advocates. Publicly convey support for human rights 
        advocates whom officials have deprived of liberty on 
        unsubstantiated criminal charges and for apparent 
        political or religious reasons.
          Stress to the Chinese government the importance of 
        procedural compliance and effective legal 
        representation in criminal cases in relation to the 
        goal of rule-based governance.
          Urge Chinese officials to end all forms of 
        extrajudicial detention that are imposed without 
        meeting the standards for a fair trial as set forth in 
        the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
        Rights and other international human rights 
        instruments.
          Consult with Chinese officials regarding progress 
        toward adopting the recommendations made by the UN 
        Committee against Torture in relation to China's 
        compliance with the Convention against Torture and 
        Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
        Punishment, such as the call to repeal the provisions 
        allowing ``residential surveillance at a designated 
        location.'' Further, encourage Chinese officials to 
        extend invitations to all UN special rapporteurs and 
        other special procedures that have requested visits to 
        China.
          Stress to the Chinese government the need for greater 
        transparency on the number and circumstances of 
        executions, and urge Chinese officials to further limit 
        the crimes to which the death penalty is applicable.
          Continue and, where appropriate, expand support for 
        programs involving U.S. entities engaging with reform-
        minded Chinese organizations and individuals (both 
        within and outside the government) that draw on 
        comparative experience to improve the criminal justice 
        process. For example, the experience of the United 
        States and other jurisdictions can inform China as it 
        charts a path toward reducing reliance on confessions, 
        enhancing the role of witnesses at trials, and creating 
        more reliable procedures for reviewing death penalty 
        cases.
          Call on the Chinese government to publicly commit to 
        a specific timetable for ratification of the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
        which the Chinese government signed in 1998 but has not 
        yet ratified.
                          Freedom of Religion
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Both Chinese and international law provide 
        guarantees for religious freedom. Despite these 
        guarantees, the Commission continued to observe 
        widespread and systematic violation of the principles 
        of religious freedom as Chinese authorities exercised 
        broad discretion over the religious practice of Chinese 
        citizens.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government released draft 
        revisions to the Regulations on Religious Affairs (RRA) 
        in September 2016. The draft revisions were released 
        following a major leadership conference on religious 
        policy convened by Chinese President and Communist 
        Party General Secretary Xi Jinping in April 2016. At 
        this conference, Xi promoted the ``sinicization'' of 
        religion in China, a term that officials have used 
        often in recent years to encourage the adaptation of 
        religious beliefs and activities to align with 
        government and Party interests. One international 
        rights organization characterized the draft revisions 
        to the RRA as ``implementing the new ideology [of 
        sinicization] on a legislative level.'' The draft 
        revisions were in line with a long-term Party policy of 
        using religion as an instrument for promoting national 
        unity and social stability, although commentators also 
        drew parallels with recently implemented restrictions 
        on civil society groups through legislative reforms 
        such as the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas Non-
        Governmental Organizations' Activities. On September 7, 
        2017, the State Council issued the revisions to the 
        RRA, to take effect on February 1, 2018. The final 
        revisions contained few changes from the earlier draft.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government's regulatory framework 
        for religious affairs imposes numerous restrictions on 
        religious freedom. Religious activity is subject to 
        extensive government approvals and restrictions, 
        including official guidelines for the content and 
        distribution of religious publications, restrictions 
        that limit religious activity to government-approved 
        sites, and requirements that religious personnel be 
        approved by local religious affairs authorities. 
        Current regulations require religious groups to 
        register with the government, and legal protection of 
        religious activities is contingent on complying with 
        registration requirements. Unregistered religious and 
        spiritual communities are especially vulnerable to 
        government harassment, detention, and other abuses; yet 
        groups may be sanctioned regardless of registration 
        status when officials view them as posing a challenge 
        to government authority. The government has also 
        continued to ban some belief systems outright.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; While government and Party officials rarely 
        targeted Chinese Buddhist and Taoist communities with 
        direct suppression, they nonetheless continued to 
        subject these religions to extensive regulation and 
        control.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The government maintained measures that impede 
        the freedom of Chinese Catholic congregations to be led 
        by clergy who are selected and who conduct their 
        ministry according to the standards called for by 
        Catholic religious beliefs. The government also 
        continued to harass, detain, or hold incommunicado 
        certain leading Catholic clergy.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Government and Party officials continued to 
        subject Protestant Christian belief and practice to a 
        wide range of restrictions and abuse. Unregistered 
        Protestant churches throughout China continued to face 
        raids during church gatherings, eviction from meeting 
        spaces, and official bans on worship. Authorities also 
        subjected some believers to harassment, violence, or 
        detention. In several instances, house church members 
        were detained on the charge of ``organizing and using a 
        cult to undermine implementation of the law'' under 
        Article 300 of the PRC Criminal Law.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Commission noted reports of continued 
        repression of Falun Gong practitioners, by means 
        including harassment, arbitrary detention, and 
        prosecution. International observers continued to 
        express concern over reports that numerous organ 
        transplants in China have used the organs of detained 
        prisoners, including those of Falun Gong practitioners. 
        International medical professionals were skeptical of a 
        Chinese health official's claim that the organ 
        procurement system has been reformed in compliance with 
        international standards, noting discrepancies and a 
        lack of transparency in official data.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During this reporting year, officials 
        maintained policies exerting strong influence and 
        control over the religious belief and activities of Hui 
        Muslim believers. Although policies for Hui Muslims 
        remained far less repressive than those affecting 
        Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, 
        hostile rhetoric targeting Hui Muslims from both 
        officials and the public increased. One expert said 
        that this could increase the likelihood that policies 
        affecting the religious freedom of Hui Muslims may 
        become more restrictive.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Religious communities outside of the five 
        religions that are the main objects of religious 
        affairs regulations continued to exist within China. 
        Some, such as folk religions and Eastern Orthodox 
        Christianity, are recognized at the local level. In 
        contrast, authorities maintained restrictions imposed 
        suddenly in 2014 on Jewish religious activity in 
        Kaifeng municipality, Henan province.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Call on the Chinese government to guarantee to all 
        citizens freedom of religion in accordance with its 
        international human rights obligations. Stress to 
        Chinese authorities that freedom of religion includes 
        the right to freely adopt beliefs and practice 
        religious activities without government interference, 
        particularly those based on political goals.
          Stress to the Chinese government that the right to 
        freedom of religion includes, but is not limited to: 
        the right of Buddhists and Taoists to carry out 
        activities in temples and select monastic teachers 
        independent of state controls; the right of Catholics 
        to be led by clergy who are selected and who conduct 
        their ministry according to the standard called for by 
        Catholic religious beliefs; the right of Falun Gong 
        practitioners to freely practice Falun Gong inside 
        China; the right of Muslims to freely preach, undertake 
        overseas pilgrimage, select and train religious 
        leaders, and wear clothing with religious significance; 
        the right of Protestants to exercise their faith free 
        from state controls over doctrine and worship, and free 
        from harassment, detention, and other abuses for public 
        and private manifestations of their faith, including 
        the display of crosses; and the right of members of 
        other religious communities, such as Judaism, to be 
        free from state control and harassment.
          Call for the release of Chinese citizens confined, 
        detained, or imprisoned for peacefully pursuing their 
        religious beliefs, as well as people confined, 
        detained, or imprisoned in connection to their 
        association with those people. Such individuals include 
        Bishop Thaddeus Ma Daqin, who has been under extralegal 
        confinement since July 2012 for renouncing his 
        affiliation with the Chinese Catholic Patriotic 
        Association; Pastors Bao Guohua and Xing Wenxiang of 
        Jinhua municipality, Zhejiang province; those 
        affiliated with the Living Stone Church in Guizhou 
        province, including its pastor, Li Guozhi (also known 
        as Yang Hua); and other prisoners mentioned in this 
        report and in the Commission's Political Prisoner 
        Database. The Administration should use existing laws 
        to hold accountable Chinese government officials and 
        others complicit in severe religious freedom 
        restrictions, including by using the sanctions 
        available in the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
        Accountability Act and the International Religious 
        Freedom Act of 1998. Ensure that conditions related to 
        religious freedom are taken into account when 
        negotiating any trade agreement as mandated by the 
        Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and 
        Accountability Act of 2015 (Public Law No. 114-26).
          Call on the Chinese government to fully implement 
        accepted recommendations from its October 2013 UN 
        Universal Periodic Review, including taking necessary 
        measures to ensure that rights to freedom of religion, 
        religious culture, and expression are fully observed 
        and protected; cooperating with the UN human rights 
        system, specifically UN special procedures and mandate 
        holders; facilitating visits for UN High Commissioners 
        to China; taking steps to ensure lawyers working to 
        advance religious rights can practice their profession 
        freely and promptly investigating allegations of 
        violence and intimidation impeding their work; and 
        considering possible revisions to legislation and 
        administrative rules to provide better protection of 
        freedom of religion.
          Call on the Chinese government to abolish Article 300 
        of the PRC Criminal Law, which criminalizes 
        ``organizing and using a cult to undermine 
        implementation of the law,'' and Article 27 of the PRC 
        Public Security Administration Punishment Law, which 
        provides for detention or fines for organizing or 
        inciting others to engage in ``cult'' activities and 
        for using ``cults'' or the ``guise of religion'' to 
        disturb social order or to harm others' health.
          Encourage U.S. political leaders to visit religious 
        sites in China to raise awareness of and promote 
        freedom of religion.
                         Ethnic Minority Rights
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty 
        and human rights, Philip Alston, following his 2016 
        visit to China, issued a report criticizing what he saw 
        as authorities' lack of consultation with ethnic 
        minorities regarding economic development that affects 
        them, and he recommended that the State Ethnic Affairs 
        Commission develop policies integrating human rights 
        considerations into all aspects of its policymaking.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; As in past reporting years, Inner Mongolia 
        Autonomous Region (IMAR) authorities detained Mongol 
        herders who engaged in peaceful protests related to 
        grasslands, including those who voiced their concerns 
        online or talked with foreign reporters about their 
        complaints.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Mongol rights advocate Hada reportedly 
        continued to press authorities to hold officials 
        accountable for mistreating him during his 15-year 
        prison sentence and subsequent detention and 
        surveillance. IMAR authorities imprisoned Hada for 15 
        years starting in 1995 and then held him in extralegal 
        detention for another 4 years, following his 
        organization of peaceful demonstrations for Mongol 
        rights and his establishment of the banned Southern 
        Mongolian Democratic Alliance. In a November 2016 
        interview, he described his living conditions, in an 
        apartment heavily surveilled by security personnel, as 
        similar to those he experienced under detention, 
        complaining that authorities had at times cut off his 
        family's water and heat in an effort to compel him to 
        ``cooperate with them and give up [his] ideas.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Mongol parents and students in the IMAR 
        reportedly faced limits on access to Mongolian-language 
        instruction during the past reporting year, in spite of 
        Chinese law protecting the use of minority languages. 
        In late 2016, Mongol parents in Chifeng municipality, 
        IMAR, published open letters on social media and 
        demonstrated outside government offices to protest the 
        appointment of Han Chinese principals to the only two 
        kindergartens in Chifeng that provide instruction in 
        the Mongolian language. The administrations of the two 
        schools reportedly restricted the use of the Mongolian 
        language, and at least one of the schools banned Mongol 
        teachers from speaking Mongolian in the office.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Continue to build the capacity of Mongol, Uyghur, and 
        Tibetan groups working to advance human rights, 
        environmental protection, economic development, and 
        rule of law in China through U.S. foreign assistance 
        funding and by encouraging additional support from both 
        UN and non-governmental sources.
          Convey to the Chinese government the importance of 
        respecting and protecting ethnic minority cultures and 
        languages. Urge Chinese officials to provide ethnic 
        minority students and parents a choice of what language 
        or languages of instruction should be used at schools 
        they attend in accordance with the PRC Regional Ethnic 
        Autonomy Law and the UN Declaration on the Rights of 
        Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
        Linguistic Minorities. Call on Chinese officials to 
        establish mechanisms preserving and expanding existing 
        instruction in ethnic minority languages from the 
        preschool to the university level.
          Call on the Chinese government to allow Mongol 
        herders to exercise their fundamental rights of freedom 
        of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, as 
        well as the right to be free from arbitrary detention. 
        Convey to Chinese officials the importance of 
        consulting with ethnic minority communities regarding 
        the impact of proposed development on their traditional 
        grazing lands.
          Urge Chinese authorities to end restrictions on the 
        freedom of movement and other unlawful restrictions 
        against Hada, his wife Xinna, and their son, Uiles. The 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights grants ``everyone 
        . . . the right to freedom of movement and residence 
        within the borders of each state.'' Emphasize in 
        meetings with Chinese officials the need to hold 
        accountable local officials responsible for the 
        continued persecution of Hada, Xinna, and Uiles.
                           Population Control
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese government authorities continued to 
        actively promote and implement coercive population 
        control policies that violate international standards, 
        including the 1995 Beijing Declaration, the 1994 
        Programme of Action of the Cairo International 
        Conference on Population and Development, and the 
        Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
        Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Authorities 
        continued to place an emphasis on birth limits and 
        adherence to family planning as a ``basic national 
        policy.'' The amended PRC Population and Family 
        Planning Law and provincial-level regulations limit 
        couples' freedom to build their families as they see 
        fit.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, 
        Communist Party and central government authorities 
        implemented the ``universal two-child policy,'' that 
        became effective on January 1, 2016, which allows all 
        married couples to have two children. Chinese 
        government statistics, however, showed that the 
        universal two-child policy had limited to moderate 
        impact after a year of implementation. The National 
        Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) reported that the 
        number of total births in 2016 was 17.86 million, 1.31 
        million more than the 2015 NBS figure. The increase was 
        lower than the 3 million additional births per year 
        that the National Population and Family Planning 
        Commission had predicted.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Human rights advocates, demographic experts, 
        and others expressed concerns that the coercive 
        implementation of family planning measures and human 
        rights abuses will persist despite the adoption of the 
        universal two-child policy.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The amended PRC Population and Family Planning 
        Law contains provisions that prohibit officials from 
        infringing upon the ``legitimate rights and interests'' 
        of citizens while implementing family planning 
        policies. Some provincial population planning 
        regulations, however, continued to explicitly instruct 
        officials to carry out abortions for ``out-of-plan'' 
        pregnancies, often referred to as ``remedial 
        measures.'' Local authorities continued to promote 
        ``family planning work'' that entailed harsh and 
        invasive family planning measures. Officials imposed or 
        threatened various punishments to enforce family 
        planning policies, including heavy fines, detention, 
        forced sterilization, and abortion.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During this reporting year, central and local 
        governments continued to implement household 
        registration (hukou) reforms to register ``illegal 
        residents'' (heihu), a term commonly used to refer to 
        people who lack hukou in China. According to 2010 
        national census data, over 60 percent of the 13 million 
        ``illegal residents'' were people born in excess of 
        birth quotas. Other reports indicated that the number 
        of ``illegal residents'' might be higher than 13 
        million. ``Illegal residents'' face considerable 
        difficulty accessing social benefits typically afforded 
        to registered citizens. The People's Daily reported in 
        March 2017 that approximately 14 million ``illegal 
        residents'' had registered for hukou since November 
        2012. Some ``illegal residents,'' however, reportedly 
        continued to face difficulty in registering for hukou, 
        including those born to unmarried parents.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Decades of population control policies have 
        exacerbated China's demographic challenges, which 
        include a rapidly aging population, shrinking 
        workforce, and sex ratio imbalance. China's total 
        fertility rate has dropped from approximately 3 births 
        per woman in the late 1970s to a reported 1.7 births 
        per woman in 2017, below the replacement rate of 2.1 
        births per woman necessary to maintain a stable 
        population. The NBS reported that from 2015 to 2016, 
        China's working-age population (persons between the 
        ages of 16 and 59) declined by 3.49 million people to 
        907.47 million, while the elderly population (persons 
        aged 60 or older) increased by approximately 8.86 
        million in 2016 to 230.86 million people, or 16.7 
        percent of the total population. The overall sex ratio 
        in 2016 was 104.98 males to 100 females, and there were 
        approximately 33.59 million more males than females in 
        China.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; This past year, international media reports 
        continued to suggest a link between China's large 
        number of ``surplus males'' and the trafficking of 
        foreign women into China for forced marriage or 
        commercial sexual exploitation. Reports also indicate 
        that the Chinese government's population control 
        policies have contributed to illegal adoptions, as a 
        traditional preference for sons combined with birth 
        limits may encourage a black market for illegal 
        adoptions.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Press Chinese government officials to bring the PRC 
        Population and Family Planning Law into conformance 
        with international standards set forth in international 
        agreements, including the 1995 Beijing Declaration, the 
        1994 Programme of Action of the Cairo International 
        Conference on Population and Development, the 
        Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the 
        International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
        Rights. Urge the Chinese government to address concerns 
        about China's coercive implementation of the population 
        control policy raised by the UN Committee against 
        Torture in its concluding observations on the fifth 
        periodic review of China's compliance with the 
        Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
        Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
          Highlight the looming demographic challenges 
        currently facing China in bilateral meetings with 
        Chinese government officials--including a rapidly aging 
        population, shrinking workforce, and sex ratio 
        imbalance. Urge the Chinese government to heed the 
        recommendations of domestic and international 
        demographic experts by ending all birth restrictions on 
        families and abolishing ``social compensation fees.''
          Urge the Chinese government to continue its existing 
        efforts to register all Chinese citizens without hukou. 
        In line with the Girls Count Act of 2015, the U.S. 
        State Department and the U.S. Agency for International 
        Development should support training and programs that 
        contribute to improvements in the registration of 
        girls, in order to increase rights and opportunities 
        for women and girls in China.
          Use authorities provided in the Global Magnitsky 
        Human Rights Accountability Act, as appropriate, to 
        impose sanctions against Chinese officials who engage 
        in gross violations of human rights--including those 
        involving forced sterilizations and forced abortions--
        of individuals while implementing family planning 
        policies. Call on China's central and local governments 
        to vigorously enforce provisions of Chinese laws that 
        provide for punishment of officials and other 
        individuals who engage in these abuses.
          Publicly link, with supporting evidence, the sex 
        ratio imbalance exacerbated by China's population 
        control policies with potential regional humanitarian 
        and security concerns--human trafficking, crime, 
        increased internal and external migration, and other 
        possible serious social, economic, and political 
        problems--and discuss and address these issues in 
        bilateral dialogues.
                   Freedom of Residence and Movement
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government continued the use of 
        the household registration (hukou) system established 
        in 1958. The hukou system limits the right of Chinese 
        citizens to freely choose their place of residence. The 
        hukou system classifies Chinese citizens as either 
        rural or urban, conferring legal rights and access to 
        public services based on the classification. 
        Implementation of hukou regulations discriminates 
        against rural hukou holders, including those who 
        migrate to urban areas, by denying them equal access to 
        public benefits and services enjoyed by registered 
        urban residents. The hukou system contravenes 
        international human rights standards guaranteeing 
        freedom of residence and prohibiting discrimination on 
        the basis of ``national or social origin, . . . birth 
        or other status.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese central government and local 
        authorities continued to implement reforms to the hukou 
        system and other restrictions on Chinese citizens' 
        freedom of residence. The central government reiterated 
        its plans to have 100 million individuals move to urban 
        areas and obtain local, urban-registered hukou between 
        2015 and 2020. Local jurisdictions took steps to 
        implement a new residence permit system, as directed by 
        the central government's January 2016 Provisional 
        Regulations on Residence Permits. As of August 2017, at 
        least 29 provincial-level jurisdictions had reportedly 
        issued implementing measures for residence permits.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Authorities continued to deny some Chinese 
        citizens who criticize the government their 
        internationally recognized right to leave the country, 
        through methods including mass confiscation of 
        passports and individual travel bans. Authorities in 
        Guangdong province prevented Australian permanent 
        resident and Chinese citizen Feng Chongyi from 
        returning to Australia for over a week in March and 
        April 2017, reportedly in connection with his research 
        on Chinese rights lawyers.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Commission continued to observe reports of 
        Chinese government officials punishing rights advocates 
        and their families and associates, and targeting some 
        members of ethnic minority groups by restricting their 
        freedom of movement, in violation of Article 12 of the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
        Authorities heightened restrictions on movement during 
        politically sensitive periods, and placed particularly 
        strict controls on Uyghurs and Tibetans and residents 
        of ethnic minority areas.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Call on Chinese authorities to accelerate reforms to 
        the hukou system, including lowering restrictions on 
        migration to major cities and centers of economic 
        opportunity; equalizing the level and quality of public 
        benefits and services tied to local hukou and residence 
        permits; and implementing laws and regulations to 
        provide equal treatment for all Chinese citizens, 
        regardless of place of birth or residence, or hukou or 
        residence status.
          Support programs, organizations, and exchanges with 
        Chinese policymakers and academic institutions engaged 
        in research and outreach to migrants, in order to 
        advance legal and anti-discrimination assistance for 
        migrants and their families, and to encourage policy 
        debates aimed at eliminating inequality and 
        discrimination connected to residence policies, 
        including the hukou system.
          Emphasize in meetings with Chinese officials that the 
        government's noncompliance with international standards 
        on freedom of movement and travel negatively affects 
        confidence in the Chinese government's commitment to 
        international standards.
          Call on the Chinese central government to combat 
        provincial and local authorities' arbitrary and 
        discriminatory restrictions on the ability of residents 
        of ethnic minority areas, in particular Uyghurs and 
        Tibetans, to move freely inside China and to travel 
        abroad.
          Raise specifically Chinese authorities' restrictions 
        on the freedom of movement and the right to leave the 
        country of rights defenders, lawyers, critics of the 
        government, and their family members and associates, 
        including, among others: Feng Chongyi, a professor and 
        Australian permanent resident; Lu Dongli, a rights 
        defender; Yao Lifa, a democracy advocate and former 
        independent local people's congress candidate; and 
        human rights lawyers Liu Zhengqing and Chen Jian'gang.
                            Status of Women
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Despite a legal framework prohibiting 
        employment discrimination, employers in China continued 
        to discriminate against women in recruiting, hiring, 
        compensation, and other employment practices. 
        Employment discrimination against women based on 
        pregnancy continues to be a serious problem, with much 
        of the discrimination against women in employment due 
        to employers' desire to avoid the cost of maternity 
        leave for female employees. Such discrimination is 
        expected to worsen with the continuing implementation 
        of the ``universal two-child policy.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The legal advocacy of women seeking redress 
        for gender discrimination in employment continued and 
        seemed to gain some influence. During this reporting 
        year, the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court in 
        Guangdong province held that a restaurant owed one 
        woman compensation and an apology for refusing to 
        interview or hire her for a chef's apprentice position 
        based on her gender. The Supreme People's Court (SPC) 
        included a recent gender discrimination case among its 
        guiding cases, released in August 2016. SPC official 
        Guo Feng said that because the case imposed civil 
        liability, it would deter other employers from 
        violating laws on gender equality.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Women in China continued to face challenges 
        with domestic and sexual violence. Experts on the PRC 
        Anti-Domestic Violence Law (in effect since March 2016) 
        noted that challenges to implementation include lack of 
        awareness, inadequate resources for training of public 
        security officials, gender discrimination within the 
        legal system, and enforcement that prioritizes family 
        cohesion and ``social stability'' over the safety of 
        victims. Victims of sexual violence also faced 
        challenges in obtaining legal redress, as they were 
        reportedly reluctant to come forward due to pressure 
        from family and society.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Women continued to lack secure rights to 
        property in both rural and urban areas due to a 
        combination of legal policies and traditionalist 
        cultural pressures, particularly after marriage.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese officials prevented some women's 
        rights advocates from engaging in activism and 
        providing services--a continuation of the intensifying 
        restrictions on women's rights advocacy begun in 2015.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government continued to target 
        individual women's rights advocates with criminal 
        prosecution and other forms of harassment. One 
        prominent example is that of women's rights and 
        democracy activist Su Changlan, whom authorities 
        detained in October 2014 and tried in April 2016 for 
        ``inciting subversion of state power.'' She was 
        convicted on March 31, 2017, and is expected to be 
        released in October.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Publicly and privately urge the Chinese government to 
        give rights advocate Su Changlan immediate access to 
        medical care and to release her from arbitrary 
        detention. After Su's sentence ends in October 2017, 
        urge the Chinese government to ensure that she is free 
        of state-imposed surveillance, harassment, and 
        restrictions to her freedom of residence, movement, and 
        expression. In addition, urge the release of advocates 
        Chen Qitang and Shan Lihua, and immediately cease 
        intimidation and harassment of their family members and 
        associates.
          Publicly and privately urge the Chinese government to 
        respect the freedom of expression and assembly of all 
        rights advocates, and in particular to refrain from 
        harassing and intimidating the independent women's 
        rights advocates seeking to increase awareness about 
        sexual harassment in public areas.
          Urge the Chinese government to publicly expand its 
        commitment to gender equality through measures such as 
        increasing the number of women in the highest levels of 
        political leadership, instituting gender equality and 
        anti-harassment trainings in government workplaces, and 
        challenging discriminatory attitudes based on gender 
        through public education.
          Commend the Chinese government for recent legal 
        developments aimed at promoting the welfare of women 
        and gender equality. These include the passage of the 
        PRC Anti-Domestic Violence Law and the inclusion of a 
        gender discrimination case among the Supreme People's 
        Court's guiding cases. Encourage the government to 
        strengthen formal support services for implementation--
        for example, by increasing funding for health services 
        or shelters for women experiencing violence, providing 
        funding and support for attorneys for legal services, 
        and allowing independent lawyers and advocates to 
        assist with the promotion and implementation of laws 
        related to gender equality through lawsuits and public 
        campaigns.
          Support international exchanges among academics, 
        legal advocates, non-governmental organizations, and 
        others that focus on the implementation and enforcement 
        of recently adopted laws promoting gender equity. In 
        particular, facilitate and support technical assistance 
        programs that would help both men and women working in 
        law enforcement and the judiciary to implement the PRC 
        Anti-Domestic Violence Law effectively and challenge 
        discriminatory attitudes based on gender. As the first 
        point of contact, law enforcement in particular should 
        be trained in addressing reports of violence in a way 
        that does not undermine victims' concerns or safety.
          Facilitate and support technical assistance programs 
        that would help the development of gender equality 
        education in schools and communities.
          Encourage the collection and analysis of data on 
        gender-based disparities in economic and social life so 
        as to monitor changes.
                           Human Trafficking
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; As a State Party to the UN Protocol to 
        Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
        Especially Women and Children (UN TIP Protocol), China 
        is obligated to enact legislation criminalizing human 
        trafficking as defined by the UN TIP Protocol. The 
        definition of human trafficking in Chinese law, 
        however, remains inconsistent with UN TIP Protocol 
        standards. Inconsistencies between domestic law and 
        international standards contribute to the difficulty of 
        assessing the scale of human trafficking in China.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; China remains a destination for the 
        trafficking of men, women, and children from throughout 
        Asia. The Commission observed reports of alleged human 
        trafficking of Chinese nationals to the United States, 
        Europe, and elsewhere for forced labor and sexual 
        exploitation. Men, women, and children reportedly were 
        trafficked within China's borders for forced labor, 
        forced begging, forced marriage, and sexual 
        exploitation.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; This past year, the Chinese government 
        subjected individuals to forced labor in administrative 
        detention centers, pretrial detention, and through a 
        forced labor program known as hashar in the Xinjiang 
        Uyghur Autonomous Region.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese workers migrating within China and 
        their children were particularly at risk of human 
        trafficking, in part due to restrictions arising from 
        China's household registration (hukou) system. 
        Government restrictions on workers' rights to form 
        independent unions and collective bargaining also 
        exacerbated their vulnerability to trafficking.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government continued to treat 
        North Korean refugees as economic migrants, and 
        maintained a policy of repatriating undocumented North 
        Koreans, leaving the refugees vulnerable to 
        trafficking. The government of the Democratic People's 
        Republic of Korea reportedly continued to generate 
        revenue by sending North Korean nationals to work in 
        China under conditions that one expert described as 
        slave labor.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; China's sex ratio imbalance--exacerbated by 
        government-imposed birth limits and in keeping with a 
        traditional bias for sons--created a demand for 
        marriageable women that may contribute to human 
        trafficking for forced marriage and sexual 
        exploitation. According to the National Bureau of 
        Statistics of China, in 2016, China had approximately 
        33.59 million more men than women.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Hong Kong remained a destination for human 
        trafficking, with migrant domestic workers particularly 
        at risk of exploitation for forced labor. A December 
        2016 ruling by a Hong Kong court found that Hong Kong's 
        Bill of Rights Ordinance requires the Hong Kong 
        government to enact stronger anti-trafficking 
        legislation. In response to questions from a Hong Kong 
        lawmaker regarding what steps the government had taken 
        following the court ruling, the government stated that 
        human trafficking ``is not prevalent or widespread in 
        Hong Kong,'' and that human trafficking ``is 
        effectively prohibited by various pieces of existing 
        legislation in Hong Kong.''
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Urge the Chinese government to abide by its 
        commitments under the UN TIP Protocol to bring anti-
        trafficking legislation into alignment with 
        international standards, specifically with regard to 
        China's legal definition of human trafficking. 
        Emphasize that this would facilitate better data 
        collection and cross-border comparisons, which in turn 
        would better inform domestic and multilateral anti-
        trafficking policies. Call on the Chinese government to 
        extend coverage of the UN TIP Protocol to include Hong 
        Kong.
          Support U.S. Government efforts to improve human 
        trafficking data collection. Work with regional 
        governments, multilateral institutions, and non-
        governmental organizations (NGOs) to encourage and 
        support the collection of more accurate data in order 
        to better assess the scale and root causes of human 
        trafficking in Asia and monitor the effectiveness of 
        anti-trafficking measures.
          Discuss in appropriate bilateral and multilateral 
        meetings the importance of protecting worker rights as 
        a means of combating human trafficking for the purpose 
        of forced labor. Stress that when workers are able to 
        organize and advocate for their rights, they are less 
        vulnerable to all forms of exploitation, including 
        forced labor. Highlight the September 2016 report of 
        the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of 
        peaceful assembly and of association, Maina Kiai, which 
        stated that the failure to protect workers' right to 
        freedom of association ``directly contributes to 
        problems such as human trafficking and slavery.''
          Encourage and engage in continued regional 
        cooperation to combat human trafficking through 
        multilateral agreements and forums such as the 
        Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative Against 
        Trafficking, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the 
        East Asia Summit. Such regional cooperation should 
        address migration and the flow of refugees, poverty, 
        sex ratio imbalances, and other risk factors that 
        contribute to human trafficking.
          Pursue cooperation on anti-trafficking efforts 
        through the U.S.-China Joint Liaison Group on Law 
        Enforcement Cooperation. Support the work of the U.S. 
        Department of State's International Law Enforcement 
        Academy Program in Bangkok, Thailand, to build regional 
        law enforcement capacity.
          Facilitate international exchanges among civil 
        society groups and industry associations to raise 
        awareness of best practices for identifying and 
        combating human trafficking in supply chains. Support 
        NGOs working on anti-trafficking research, education, 
        prevention, and victims' services throughout Asia.
          Incorporate language into bilateral and multilateral 
        economic agreements requiring member countries to 
        improve data collection on human trafficking and to 
        take concrete steps toward eliminating human 
        trafficking within their borders.
                     North Korean Refugees in China
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, 
        the Chinese government's policy of detaining North 
        Korean refugees and repatriating them to the Democratic 
        People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) remained in place, in 
        violation of its obligations under international human 
        rights and refugee law.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Heightened security measures along the China-
        North Korea and China-Southeast Asia borders increased 
        the risks North Korean refugees face, and may be 
        limiting the outflow of refugees from the DPRK. South 
        Korean Ministry of Unification data showed that 1,414 
        refugees reached South Korea in 2016, continuing the 
        trend of a significant decline in the number of 
        refugees entering South Korea since 2009.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese authorities appeared to have 
        intensified crackdowns on organizations and 
        individuals--including foreign aid workers, Christian 
        missionaries and churches, and non-governmental 
        organizations--that have played a crucial role in 
        assisting and facilitating the movement of North Korean 
        refugees outside the DPRK.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; North Korean women who enter China illegally 
        remain particularly vulnerable to human trafficking. 
        The majority of North Korean refugees leaving the DPRK 
        are women, many of whom are trafficked from the DPRK 
        into, or within, China for the purposes of forced 
        marriage and commercial sexual exploitation.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Many children born to Chinese fathers and 
        North Korean mothers remain deprived of basic rights to 
        education and other public services owing to a lack of 
        legal resident status in China. The denial of these 
        rights contravenes China's obligations under 
        international law.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Urge the Chinese government to immediately halt the 
        repatriation of North Korean refugees; consider using 
        the suite of sanctions that are available, where 
        appropriate, against Chinese government agencies and 
        individuals involved in the repatriation of North 
        Korean refugees; and press for increased international 
        monitoring of and accountability for the Chinese 
        government's treatment of refugees.
          Call on the Chinese government to address the 
        concerns of the UN Committee against Torture by 
        incorporating the principle of non-refoulement into 
        domestic legislation and allowing UN High Commissioner 
        for Refugees personnel unimpeded access to North Korean 
        refugees in China.
          Urge Chinese authorities to recognize the legal 
        status of North Korean women who marry or have children 
        with Chinese citizens, and ensure that all such 
        children are granted resident status and access to 
        education and other public services in accordance with 
        Chinese law and international standards.
          Consider passing the North Korean Human Rights 
        Reauthorization Act of 2017 and implement relevant 
        provisions pertaining to North Korean refugees in 
        China. Appoint and confirm the U.S. Special Envoy on 
        North Korean Human Rights Issues, and encourage the 
        Special Envoy to work with South Korean counterparts to 
        coordinate efforts related to humanitarian assistance 
        and human rights promotion for North Korean refugees in 
        China, in accordance with the reauthorized North Korean 
        Human Rights Act.
                             Public Health
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, 
        the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human 
        rights issued a report that assessed whether the 
        Chinese government's poverty alleviation efforts, many 
        of which dovetail with public health, ``have ensured 
        full respect for human rights in China.'' The Special 
        Rapporteur observed that the government overly 
        emphasizes development goals, and that challenges to 
        the protection of human rights and government 
        accountability include the Chinese Communist Party's 
        ``leading role'' over government, civil society, and 
        public participation; a ``top-down'' government 
        approach; and lack of accurate, publicly available 
        data.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The government and Party continued to 
        prioritize the treatment of mental health in public 
        health policymaking. Despite implementation of the PRC 
        Mental Health Law, which became effective in 2013, 
        challenges in the treatment of mental health disorders 
        include a shortage of mental health personnel and 
        community-based services.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Commission remained concerned by reports 
        that Chinese government authorities continued to 
        forcibly commit individuals without mental illness to 
        psychiatric facilities (bei jingshenbing) for 
        activities, including petitioning, that are deemed to 
        be ``troublemaking'' or politically sensitive. Reports 
        of petitioners and others whom public security 
        officials forcibly committed to psychiatric facilities 
        this past year included Sheng Lanfu, Ren Naijun, and 
        Zhu Liangqun. Media coverage of the case of Xu 
        Xueling--a petitioner serving a four-year prison 
        sentence for ``picking quarrels and provoking 
        trouble''--linked her petitioning to two instances of 
        forcible psychiatric commitment that authorities had 
        imposed to ``maintain stability.'' The December 2016 
        arrest of Liu Feiyue, founder of the human rights 
        website Civil Rights &amp;amp; Livelihood Watch (CRLW), may 
        have consequences for access to grassroots reports of 
        forced psychiatric commitment given CRLW's regular 
        coverage of the topic.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Health-based discrimination in access to 
        employment, welfare, education, and medical treatment, 
        as well as difficulties in accessing legal relief or 
        accountability, reportedly remained widespread, despite 
        prohibitions to prevent it under Chinese laws and 
        regulations. Contributing factors, according to rights 
        lawyers, include a lack of compliance with the law and 
        inconsistencies between laws and regulations.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In June 2017, a court in Guangdong province 
        issued China's first-ever judgment that held an 
        employer violated Chinese law by discriminating against 
        an employee because the employee was HIV positive. The 
        court, however, rejected the employee's request to be 
        reinstated to his job.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Call on the Chinese government to strengthen 
        implementation of the PRC Mental Health Law (MHL) and 
        stop using forced psychiatric commitment to retaliate 
        against and silence persons with grievances against the 
        government or persons with dissenting opinions and 
        preferences. Immediately release from detention Liu 
        Feiyue, founder of Civil Rights &amp;amp; Livelihood Watch, a 
        human rights website known for its coverage of the use 
        of forced psychiatric commitment. In addition, release 
        Xu Xueling--imprisoned in connection to petitioning two 
        instances of forcible psychiatric commitment--and other 
        individuals raised in this report and the Commission's 
        Political Prisoner Database subjected to forcible 
        psychiatric commitment for petitioning and other 
        activities authorities deemed politically sensitive.
          Urge the Chinese government to establish panels made 
        up of legal, medical, social work, and security 
        professionals from within and outside the government to 
        monitor and report on the implementation of the MHL and 
        initiatives planned under the National Mental Health 
        Work Plan (2015-2020) to ensure that local 
        implementation consistently meets standards of care and 
        rights protection stipulated in the MHL, the PRC Law on 
        the Protection of the Rights of Persons with 
        Disabilities, and international standards.
          Continue to support technical assistance and exchange 
        programs in the area of public health. Require that 
        U.S.-China cooperative programs include the 
        participation of U.S. and Chinese non-governmental 
        organizations.
          Urge Chinese officials to focus attention on 
        effective implementation of laws and regulations that 
        prohibit health-based discrimination in access to 
        employment and education, including abolition of the 
        national physical eligibility standards for civil 
        servants and teachers that discriminate against persons 
        with health conditions. Where appropriate, share the 
        United States' ongoing experience with and efforts in 
        promoting the rights of persons with disabilities in 
        education, employment, and public life, through non-
        governmental advocacy and services, and legal and 
        regulatory means.
                            The Environment
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During the 2017 reporting year, Chinese and 
        international media reports highlighted the severity of 
        China's air, water, and soil pollution, and related 
        health concerns. At the same time, Chinese authorities 
        continued to censor and control media reporting on the 
        environment. The Chinese government made statements 
        calling for public participation in environmental 
        protection. According to the UN Special Rapporteur on 
        extreme poverty and human rights, however, ``the 
        Government tends to rely almost entirely on top-down 
        processes.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During this reporting year, citizens engaged 
        in a number of environmental protests over issues 
        including sand mining and air pollution. In October 
        2016, as many as 10,000 people in Xi'an municipality, 
        Shaanxi province, participated in a protest over a 
        waste incinerator project. In December 2016, 
        authorities reportedly briefly detained a number of 
        advocates in Chengdu municipality, Sichuan province, 
        after they gathered wearing face masks to protest air 
        pollution.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese authorities continued to harass and 
        detain environmental advocates. In October 2016, 
        Chinese authorities administratively detained Liu Shu, 
        the leader of an environmental non-governmental 
        organization (NGO), for 10 days in Changsha 
        municipality, Hunan province, for ``leaking counter-
        espionage work state secrets.'' Her alleged offense was 
        sharing pollution data. In June 2017, the Shuangtaizi 
        District People's Court in Panjin municipality, 
        Liaoning province, sentenced Tian Jiguang, the founder 
        of the Panjin City Association of Volunteers for the 
        Protection of the Spotted Seal, to four years and six 
        months in prison. Chinese authorities detained Tian in 
        October 2013 after he wrote a blog post in which he 
        criticized a state-owned enterprise for water 
        pollution.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Judicial authorities assessed high court fees 
        on two NGOs following an environmental public interest 
        lawsuit. In January 2017, the Changzhou Intermediate 
        People's Court in Changzhou municipality, Jiangsu 
        province, ruled in favor of defendant chemical 
        manufacturers and held that the two NGOs that brought 
        the lawsuit were responsible for court fees totaling 
        1.89 million yuan (US$270,000). The head of the 
        litigation department at one of the NGOs expressed 
        concern that this case ``would set a precedent for 
        courts to use similar charging standards in future 
        environmental public interest lawsuits.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In December 2016, the National People's 
        Congress passed the PRC Environmental Tax Law. The 
        legislation provides for new environmental taxes that 
        will be jointly managed by environmental and tax 
        authorities, superseding the previous pollution 
        discharge fees that had been managed by environmental 
        authorities. Some legal experts believe the potential 
        for tax authorities to collect taxes from polluters may 
        result in a strengthening of monitoring systems.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In December 2016, the Supreme People's Court 
        and Supreme People's Procuratorate issued an 
        interpretation on environmental crimes that, if 
        implemented, may lead to more criminal enforcement for 
        environmental data manipulation. The interpretation 
        provides that criminal penalties for companies found in 
        violation of environmental standards may be based on 
        the amount of money the company saved by not operating 
        the required pollution control equipment, and criminal 
        charges of more than three years could be imposed if 
        the money saved totaled over 1 million yuan 
        (US$140,000).
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In October 2016, Chinese authorities 
        reportedly detained three environmental officials in 
        Xi'an for ``falsification'' of air quality data. In 
        June 2017, the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court 
        sentenced seven environmental officials, including the 
        three previously detained officials, to prison terms 
        ranging from 1 year and 3 months to 1 year and 10 
        months for ``damaging the computer information 
        system.'' In July 2017, the Ministry of Environmental 
        Protection, following a month-long inspection, strongly 
        criticized the Tianjin municipal government for 
        ``wantonly covering up'' its failed environmental 
        protection efforts, finding that although Tianjin 
        authorities had many meetings and campaigns, ``it was 
        more lip service than action.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government continued to develop 
        and release comprehensive plans for improving the 
        environment, although it also announced plans to 
        increase coal-fired power capacity. In December 2016, 
        the National Development and Reform Commission released 
        China's 13th Five-Year Energy Development Plan, which 
        included a mandatory target for coal energy to account 
        for 58 percent or less of energy production by 2020, a 
        6-percent decrease from 2015. The 13th Five-Year 
        Electricity Development Plan, however, included plans 
        to increase coal-fired power capacity.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Continue to support U.S.-China technical and legal 
        collaboration on environmental protection. U.S.-China 
        cooperation should focus on programs aimed at: 
        increasing media freedom; improving transparency and 
        the rule of law; reducing air, water, and soil 
        contamination; and improving government accountability.
          Encourage Chinese leaders to strengthen rule of law 
        in the environmental sector. Raise questions with 
        Chinese officials about the censorship of environmental 
        news reporting. U.S. officials should also raise 
        questions about the lack of transparency regarding 
        China's water and soil pollution.
          Call on the Chinese government to cease harassment of 
        environmental advocates and follow international 
        standards on freedom of speech, association, and 
        assembly, including those contained in the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
        the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and China's 
        Constitution. Raise the imprisonment of environmental 
        advocate Tian Jiguang in meetings with Chinese 
        officials.
          Support efforts by Chinese and U.S. groups working to 
        expand awareness of citizens' environmental rights in 
        China and the protection of those rights. Include 
        environmental law and transparency issues in bilateral 
        human rights and legal expert dialogues.
                             Civil Society
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During this reporting year, the Chinese 
        government and Communist Party continued to deepen a 
        crackdown on NGOs and civil society advocates. 
        According to international human rights organizations, 
        Chinese authorities restricted the activities of rights 
        defenders by shrinking the space for expression, 
        association, and assembly. Authorities also targeted 
        rights advocates affiliated with NGOs this past year, 
        including those promoting religious freedom, workers' 
        rights, and the environment. Examples included the 
        prosecution of pastors and labor advocates, as well as 
        the detention of an environmentalist on ``state 
        security'' grounds. Regulatory developments, 
        particularly the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas 
        Non-Governmental Organizations' Activities (Overseas 
        NGOs' Activities Law) that took effect on January 1, 
        2017, threatened the continued presence of 
        international NGOs (INGOs) in China as well as the 
        independence of domestic NGOs reliant on foreign 
        funding. The Chinese government provided limited 
        clarifications on requirements for INGOs under the law. 
        Foreign governments and NGOs sought clarification from 
        the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) on official 
        sponsorship requirements under the law.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The operating environment for INGOs in China 
        became more restricted and uncertain under the new 
        Overseas NGOs' Activities Law. Reports indicate that 
        INGOs are under greater scrutiny, and the law enables 
        the Chinese government to surveil and collect 
        information on such organizations. In addition, 
        domestic NGOs may face ``harsh penalties'' under the 
        expanded legal and regulatory framework given a 
        ``political climate of heightened security concerns'' 
        and ``decreased tolerance for certain kinds of activism 
        and expression.'' According to statistical data 
        released by the MPS, a total of 168 INGO representative 
        offices and 191 temporary activities had registered in 
        China by July 31, 2017. Out of those registered, the 
        United States had the highest number of registered INGO 
        representative offices at 50, followed by Hong Kong at 
        38, Japan at 14, and Germany and South Korea each at 
        13. Beijing municipality ranked first for the highest 
        total number of registered representative offices at 
        54, followed by Shanghai municipality at 35, Yunnan 
        province at 17, and Guangdong province at 12. 
        Registered representative offices of INGOs had 
        partnering ``professional supervisory units'' (PSUs) 
        from varying fields, with 66 representative offices 
        working with PSUs in the trade sector, 25 in civil 
        affairs, 21 in health and population planning, and 8 in 
        education.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In March 2017, Chinese authorities detained 
        Taiwan human rights NGO volunteer Lee Ming-cheh while 
        he was traveling to Zhuhai municipality, Guangdong 
        province, via Macau. Ten days after Lee disappeared, 
        the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) confirmed 
        that Chinese authorities were investigating Lee for 
        ``endangering state security.'' On May 26, the TAO 
        confirmed that state security authorities in Hunan 
        province had formally arrested Lee on suspicion of 
        ``subversion of state power.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; This past year, the Chinese government 
        continued to strengthen its policy of inspection and 
        ideological guidance over civil society. In March 2017, 
        following two State Council directives to carry out 
        inspections on the market and society released in 2015 
        and 2016, the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA) passed a 
        measure to advance official inspection of social 
        organizations, urging registration authorities to 
        conduct both planned and random inspections of civil 
        society groups. A leading small group on Party-building 
        in social organizations, administered by the MCA, 
        issued a document in March 2017 that prioritized work 
        on the Party's ideological guidance for NGOs, building 
        Party groups in organizations, and recruiting new 
        ``outstanding and talented individuals'' from NGOs as 
        cadres.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government continued efforts to 
        strengthen the philanthropic regulatory framework under 
        the PRC Charity Law to increase the level of giving in 
        China. In the first year after the law's March 2016 
        passage, 260 national- or provincial-level 
        organizations acquired ``charitable'' status and 13 
        provinces and municipalities reportedly began approving 
        charities. In addition to registering charities, the 
        law provides a legal framework for public fundraising 
        and increasing tax incentives, toward which the Chinese 
        government took steps in this past year. On February 
        24, 2017, the National People's Congress Standing 
        Committee adopted a revision to the PRC Enterprise 
        Income Tax Law, enabling donations over 12 percent of 
        an enterprise's annual total profit to be carried over 
        and deducted from taxable income during the following 
        three years.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Urge the Chinese government to hasten the enactment 
        of legal provisions pertaining to civil society that 
        are consistent with China's Constitution as well as 
        China's international obligations. Urge China to ratify 
        the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
        Rights (ICCPR). Urge the Chinese government to revise 
        or repeal the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas 
        NGOs' Activities and revise the PRC Charity Law to 
        reflect the principles of the ICCPR, especially the 
        rights to freedom of association, assembly, and 
        expression.
          Call on the Chinese government to cease harassment of 
        civil society advocates and NGOs and provide adequate 
        procedural due process for those undergoing criminal 
        trials.
          Integrate civil society issues into bilateral 
        discussions and agreements with Chinese officials to 
        promote reciprocity in the approach and implementation 
        of civil society exchanges between the United States 
        and China.
          Continue to fund, monitor, and evaluate foreign 
        assistance programs in China that support democracy 
        promotion, rule of law, and human rights advocacy.
          Take measures to facilitate the participation of 
        Chinese civil society advocates in relevant 
        international conferences and forums, and support 
        international training to build their leadership 
        capacity in non-profit management, public policy 
        advocacy, and media relations.
                 Institutions of Democratic Governance
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, 
        the Chinese Communist Party continued to play a leading 
        role in both state and society, restricting Chinese 
        citizens' ability to exercise civil and political 
        rights. Observers noted that the central role of the 
        Party in governing the state appears to have 
        strengthened since Chinese President and Party General 
        Secretary Xi Jinping came into power, further 
        ``blurring'' the lines between Party and government. In 
        March 2017, Wang Qishan, a member of the Standing 
        Committee of the Communist Party Central Committee 
        Political Bureau (Politburo) and the Secretary of the 
        Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), 
        said that ``under the Party's leadership, there is only 
        a division of labor between the Party and the 
        government; there is no separation between the Party 
        and the government.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Commission observed a continued emphasis 
        on Xi Jinping's leading role in guiding decisionmaking. 
        Following the Sixth Plenum of the 18th Central 
        Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (Sixth Plenum) 
        in October 2016, the plenum communique named Xi the 
        ``core'' (hexin) of the Party. Some observers viewed 
        the Sixth Plenum as a ``victory for Xi'' over internal 
        political opposition. At the Sixth Plenum, the Party 
        also announced that the 19th National Congress of the 
        Chinese Communist Party (19th Party Congress) would 
        take place in Beijing municipality during the second 
        half of 2017.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; This past year, Xi Jinping called for ``strict 
        governance'' of the Party. Regulations and guidelines 
        on intraparty supervision and behavioral standards 
        released after the Sixth Plenum stressed that cadres at 
        all levels must comply, especially those who hold 
        leadership positions. The CCDI continued punishing 
        high- and low-level Party officials for misconduct, 
        targeting officials in the government, military, and 
        state security apparatus. In July 2017, CCDI 
        authorities placed Sun Zhengcai, Party Secretary of 
        Chongqing municipality and a Politburo member, under 
        investigation for discipline violations--a move some 
        international observers called a political decision by 
        Xi to consolidate power ahead of the 19th Party 
        Congress. The CCDI also tightened supervision of its 
        anticorruption investigators and staff to ensure 
        stricter oversight of disciplinary enforcers.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Party and Chinese government are 
        spearheading efforts to establish a new national 
        supervisory commission for enforcing anti-graft 
        measures, a move that may result in further blurring 
        and integration of Party and government functions. In 
        December 2016, the National People's Congress approved 
        a pilot project to set up supervisory commissions to 
        oversee government conduct in Beijing municipality and 
        Shanxi and Zhejiang provinces. In January 2017, the 
        CCDI announced plans to establish a new national 
        commission in order to integrate all government 
        officials who have authority to conduct Party 
        disciplinary inspection into one institution. The new 
        commission, designed to ``strengthen the Party's united 
        leadership over anticorruption work,'' will merge 
        anticorruption functions of the CCDI, Ministry of 
        Supervision, and Supreme People's Procuratorate.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese authorities also continued to harass, 
        detain, and imprison democracy advocates who exercised 
        their rights to freedom of speech, assembly, and 
        demonstration. Some representative cases of advocates 
        whom authorities targeted this past year included Chen 
        Zongyao, Chen Zhixiao, Zhao Suli, Liu Feiyue, Huang Qi, 
        and Zi Su. Authorities detained and, in some cases, 
        sentenced individuals in connection with their 
        commemoration of the violent suppression of the 1989 
        Tiananmen protests. Such individuals included Shi 
        Tingfu, Li Xiaoling, and Ding Yajun. Authorities 
        continued to prosecute Fu Hailu, Chen Bing, Luo Fuyu, 
        and Zhang Juanyong, detained in 2016 in connection with 
        satirically labeled liquor bottles commemorating the 
        Tiananmen protests.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; This past year, central Party authorities did 
        not take any substantial steps toward political 
        liberalization. Sources highlighted multiple instances 
        in which officials interfered with or inhibited 
        meaningful public participation in local elections, 
        demonstrating that China's political institutions do 
        not meet the standards for ``genuine'' elections 
        outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
        and International Covenant on Civil and Political 
        Rights.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Public security authorities and riot police 
        cracked down on protests that arose after authorities 
        detained Lin Zulian, chief of Wukan village, Donghai 
        subdistrict, Lufeng city, Shanwei municipality, 
        Guangdong province, in June 2016. International media 
        outlets reported that, around September 13, 2016, 
        security forces used tear gas and rubber bullets 
        against protesters, a move that resulted in serious 
        injuries to villagers. Police forces interrogated and 
        expelled foreign reporters from the village, blocked 
        access to the village, and detained villagers. In 
        December 2016, the Haifeng County People's Court tried 
        and convicted nine Wukan residents for their 
        participation in the protest and gave them prison 
        sentences ranging from 2 years to 10 years and 6 
        months.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government continued to work 
        toward increasing citizens' access to information. In 
        June 2017, the State Council released draft revisions 
        to the 2008 Open Government Information (OGI) 
        Regulations and solicited public comments. The draft 
        revisions clarified the scope of OGI and defined the 
        types of information not subject to OGI. Areas not 
        subject to OGI requirements include local-level 
        information that ``endangers public safety or social 
        stability'' or that involves ethnicity or religion. 
        Despite moves in this past year to update the OGI 
        regulatory framework, Chinese authorities continued to 
        deny OGI requests in cases related to human rights 
        defenders.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Support U.S. research programs that document and 
        analyze the governing institutions and ideological 
        campaigns of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as 
        its influence over companies, government agencies, 
        legislative and judicial bodies, and non-governmental 
        organizations (NGOs).
          Employ a ``whole-of-government'' approach to 
        encourage Chinese authorities to ratify the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
        and release individuals detained or imprisoned for 
        exercising their rights to freedom of speech, 
        association, and assembly. These individuals include 
        those mentioned in this report and in the Commission's

        transparency, especially with regard to efforts to 
        expand and improve China's open government information 
        initiatives. Urge Party officials to further increase 
        the transparency of Party affairs.

        officials to establish and improve public participation 
        in government affairs. Encourage top-level officials to 
        reform governing institutions to promote an authentic 
        multi-party system with protections for freedom of 
        speech, association, and assembly.
                         Commercial Rule of Law
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; December 11, 2016, marked 15 years since China 
        acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The 
        Chinese government and Party, however, continued to 
        fail to comply with key WTO commitments, including 
        commitments to ensure equal treatment for foreign 
        enterprises; to practice a market economy; and to 
        enforce the rule of law with impartiality, 
        transparency, and uniformity. Instead, the Chinese 
        government continued to promote preferential treatment 
        for domestic industry and compel technology transfer, 
        creating an uneven playing field and altering market 
        prices both domestically and globally.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government provided significant 
        financial and political support to outbound investment 
        this past year. This raised several concerns over 
        issues including the lack of transparency about the 
        Chinese government's involvement in commercial 
        dealings, the creation of an uneven playing field for 
        foreign companies, and the distortion of market prices 
        both domestically and globally. The Chinese 
        government's preferential treatment of state-owned 
        enterprises (SOEs) in outbound investment may also 
        increase the influence of SOEs on foreign markets. Such 
        influence may further increase with implementation of 
        the Chinese government's plan for SOEs to play a major 
        role in its Belt and Road Initiative.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The government's strict control over the 
        Internet continued to serve as an indirect form of 
        preferential treatment for domestic enterprises by 
        obstructing consumers' access to global websites. In 
        March 2017, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative 
        (USTR) identified Internet censorship in China as a 
        barrier to trade for a second year, noting that Chinese 
        authorities blocked ``11 of the top 25 global sites.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese authorities continued to provide 
        ineffective protection for intellectual property. In 
        April 2017, USTR again placed China on its 301 priority 
        watch list. In December 2016, USTR identified Taobao, a 
        subsidiary of the Alibaba Group and the largest online 
        shopping website in China, as a ``notorious market'' 
        due to ``the large volume of allegedly counterfeit and 
        pirated goods.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Several cases involving the arbitrary 
        detention and investigation of Chinese and American 
        businesspeople this past year highlighted ongoing rule 
        of law and due process concerns. On April 29, 2017, 
        Chinese authorities deported American businesswoman 
        Sandy Phan-Gillis to the United States after judicial 
        authorities sentenced her to three years and six 
        months' imprisonment on the charge of espionage. 
        Authorities detained Phan-Gillis in March 2015, and in 
        June 2016, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
        found that she had been arbitrarily detained. Phan-
        Gillis was reportedly tortured in prison, and she was 
        not able to meet with a lawyer for over a year. The 
        cases of three prominent executives of Chinese firms, 
        Xiao Jianhua, Guo Wengui, and Wu Xiaohui, highlighted 
        the risks that businesspeople face when suspected of 
        corruption or when dealing closely with corrupt 
        officials.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Food and drug safety in China remained a 
        concern for Chinese and international consumers and the 
        American business community operating in China. Their 
        concerns were exacerbated by regulatory uncertainty and 
        nontransparent enforcement. Reports in January 2017 of 
        counterfeit soy sauce made with industrial salt and 
        unsafe tap water raised particular concerns for 
        consumers around the world.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Ensure that China complies with its existing World 
        Trade Organization (WTO) commitments before resuming 
        negotiations for a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) 
        with China. A BIT with China should be based on 
        reciprocity, and allow for American investment in the 
        media, entertainment, Internet, and other sectors. The 
        BIT should also strengthen human rights and rule of law 
        protections.
          The U.S. Department of State should consider issuing 
        a travel warning for China to warn Americans 
        considering travel to China of the risk of arbitrary 
        detention and torture by Chinese authorities, and the 
        risk that a detained American may not be allowed to 
        meet with a lawyer or discuss their case with U.S. 
        consular officials. The U.S. Department of State should 
        also consider revisions to the U.S.-China Consular 
        Convention to ensure that Chinese authorities are 
        required to detail the specific charges on which 
        Americans are detained, and that Americans detained in 
        China are allowed to discuss the details of their case 
        with U.S. consular officials and to meet with a lawyer.
          The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative should, 
        under WTO rules, request detailed information from the 
        Chinese government on Internet restrictions that result 
        in the blocking of the websites of U.S. companies. If 
        warranted, a WTO dispute should be considered. In 
        meetings with Chinese officials, urge the Chinese 
        government to stop blocking Internet users' access to 
        U.S. media and technology companies in China.
          Encourage U.S. companies that receive censorship 
        requests from Chinese authorities to comply with the UN 
        Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the 
        Global Network Initiative's Principles on Freedom of 
        Expression.
          In meetings with Chinese officials, urge the Chinese 
        government to improve the transparency of its foreign 
        exchange controls and to move toward a market-based 
        exchange rate.
          In meetings, urge Chinese government and Party 
        officials to increase the transparency of the 
        anticorruption campaign. Specifically raise concerns 
        regarding the reported abduction and detention of 
        Canadian citizen Xiao Jianhua from Hong Kong.
                           Access to Justice
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese Communist Party's control over the 
        judiciary became more prominent this past year when the 
        Supreme People's Court (SPC) president urged high court 
        presidents from across China to reject Western 
        principles, including ``constitutional democracy, 
        separation of powers, and judicial independence.'' The 
        SPC president also noted the convictions of rights 
        lawyer Zhou Shifeng and other rights advocates as a key 
        achievement of the court system in 2016; international 
        human rights observers, however, said these convictions 
        were politically motivated.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; With respect to developing a trial-centered 
        litigation system, a goal that the Party set forth in 
        October 2014, Chinese authorities issued an opinion 
        emphasizing the importance of in-court testimony and 
        developed evidentiary criteria for certain common 
        crimes in some localities.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; This past year, the Chinese government 
        promulgated rules in an attempt to improve the legal 
        aid system, which continued to face problems such as a 
        shortage of legal aid workers, lack of technical 
        knowledge in non-lawyer staff, and insufficient 
        reimbursement for legal-aid related expenses.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In October 2016, the general offices of the 
        Chinese government and Communist Party issued a set of 
        measures that provides for sanctions on officials who 
        mistreat individuals who petition the government for a 
        range of grievances. Despite these new measures, the 
        Commission continued to observe reports of official 
        violence against petitioners. Furthermore, authorities 
        reportedly targeted groups that supported petitioners--
        in November and December 2016, authorities detained and 
        then arrested Liu Feiyue and Huang Qi, founders of two 
        websites that report on human rights issues, including 
        officials' mistreatment of petitioners.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During this reporting year, the Chinese 
        government continued to detain and prosecute the rights 
        lawyers and advocates targeted during a nationwide, 
        coordinated crackdown that began in and around July 
        2015. Authorities harassed family members of those 
        detained and used arbitrary means to prevent lawyers 
        associated with them from renewing their law licenses.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Ministry of Justice amended two sets of 
        measures governing the licensing of lawyers and law 
        firms this past year in ways that may violate the Basic 
        Principles on the Role of Lawyers. The amendments added 
        language mandating lawyers to support the Party's 
        leadership and imposing restrictions on lawyers' 
        ability to make independent professional judgments and 
        on their rights to freedom of speech and peaceful 
        assembly.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Encourage leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and 
        government to respect the independence of the judiciary 
        and to eliminate all forms of political influence on 
        it.
          Encourage Chinese legislators and judicial officials 
        to implement an effective supervisory mechanism that 
        ensures courts at all levels accept cases filed by all 
        individuals, including petitioners and advocates, in a 
        non-discriminatory manner.
          Encourage the Chinese government to take substantive 
        action to implement the trial-centered litigation 
        system that is designed to ensure the legality of 
        evidence obtained during the pretrial process.
          Increase support for programs that promote dialogue 
        between U.S. and Chinese legal experts regarding how 
        China can structure and implement legal reforms. 
        Concomitantly increase support for collaboration 
        between U.S. and Chinese academic and non-governmental 
        entities to foster programs that enhance the Chinese 
        legal system's capacity for protecting citizens' 
        rights.
          Urge the Chinese government to stop all forms of 
        persecution or prosecution of petitioners who use the 
        petitioning system to seek redress for their 
        grievances.
          Urge the Chinese government to unconditionally 
        exonerate and lift any restrictions of liberty or 
        eligibility to practice law on the rights lawyers and 
        advocates detained in the crackdown that began in and 
        around July 2015, including Wang Yu, Bao Longjun, Zhou 
        Shifeng, Wang Quanzhang, Li Heping, Li Chunfu, Xie 
        Yang, Wu Gan, Hu Shigen, Gou Hongguo, Liu Xing, and 
        Zhang Wanhe. Raise concerns that the recent amendments 
        to measures regulating lawyers and law firm licensing 
        violate international standards concerning lawyers' 
        rights to free speech, peaceful assembly, and 
        independent exercise of professional judgment.
          Urge the Chinese government to protect the 
        fundamental civil and professional rights of China's 
        lawyers, to investigate all allegations of abuse 
        against them, and to ensure that those responsible are 
        brought to justice. Urge the Chinese government to end 
        all forms of harassment or persecution against the 
        family members of human rights lawyers and advocates 
        affected by the July 2015 crackdown, including 
        surveillance, restrictions on domestic and 
        international travel, and preventing school attendance.
                                Xinjiang
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, 
        central and regional government authorities introduced 
        new security measures and expanded implementation of 
        existing security controls targeting Uyghur communities 
        and individuals in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
        Region (XUAR). According to official statistics, XUAR 
        authorities spent 30.05 billion yuan (approximately 
        US$4.43 billion) on public security in 2016, nearly 20 
        percent more than the previous year. After Chen Quanguo 
        became XUAR Communist Party Secretary in August 2016, 
        replacing Zhang Chunxian, regional authorities 
        implemented a number of new security measures. These 
        included, but were not limited to, the installation of 
        ``convenience police stations'' throughout the region, 
        with 949 in the regional capital of Urumqi alone; the 
        convening of mass anti-terrorism rallies; the 
        recruitment of tens of thousands of security personnel 
        from both within and outside of the XUAR; the 
        implementation of a ``double-linked household'' 
        (shuanglian hu) system; and the mandatory installation 
        of satellite-tracking devices on vehicles in one 
        prefecture in the XUAR.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; On March 29, 2017, the XUAR People's Congress 
        adopted the region's first anti-extremism regulations. 
        The regulations categorize 15 actions as ``extremism,'' 
        and according to a Chinese legal scholar, ``[draw] a 
        clear line between legal religion and illegal 
        religion.'' In July 2016, the XUAR People's Congress 
        adopted regional measures to implement the PRC 
        Counterterrorism Law, which also dealt with how to 
        punish religious extremists. The 2017 anti-extremism 
        regulations, however, provide more detailed 
        descriptions of the responsibilities of government 
        authorities to eliminate ``extremism.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; As in past reporting years, XUAR officials 
        continued to restrict Uyghurs' ability to travel 
        freely, in violation of Chinese law and international 
        legal standards. Beginning in October 2016, authorities 
        in locations throughout the XUAR reportedly ordered 
        residents to turn their passports in to police, with 
        varying deadlines of up to four months. Authorities 
        subsequently required residents to seek approval from 
        police for international travel in order to retrieve 
        their passports.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Beginning in late January 2017, Chinese 
        authorities reportedly ordered some Uyghurs studying 
        abroad in countries including Egypt, Turkey, France, 
        Australia, and the United States to return to the XUAR. 
        XUAR authorities detained or threatened to detain 
        relatives of some students to compel them to return, 
        and reportedly detained some returnees and forced some 
        to undergo ``political reeducation.''
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; During this reporting year, central and 
        regional government and Party officials continued to 
        promote the XUAR as an important center for Belt and 
        Road (also known as One Belt, One Road) Initiative 
        development projects. A U.S.-based Uyghur rights 
        organization criticized the economic inequality 
        exacerbated by official development projects, as well 
        as the enhanced securitization officials employed to 
        accompany such projects.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Central and regional officials also placed 
        restrictions on communication tools, issued regulations 
        limiting the spread of ``false'' and ``harmful'' 
        information, and constrained the ability of foreign 
        journalists to report from the XUAR. In one example of 
        authorities restricting XUAR residents' access to 
        communication tools, authorities issued regulations, 
        effective October 1, 2016, requiring individuals in the 
        region to register with their real names before being 
        permitted to access the Internet, including on their 
        mobile phones.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; XUAR government authorities expanded Mandarin-
        focused ``bilingual education'' in the region, a policy 
        that contravenes international law and that a Uyghur 
        rights advocacy organization criticized for its 
        emphasis on Mandarin-language education at the expense 
        of other languages as well as for the loss of Uyghur 
        educators' jobs. Under ``bilingual education,'' class 
        instruction takes place primarily in Mandarin Chinese, 
        largely replacing instruction in languages spoken by 
        ethnic minority groups. In June 2017, education 
        officials in Hotan prefecture, XUAR, banned the use of 
        the Uyghur language in schools through the secondary 
        school level, ``in order to strengthen elementary and 
        middle/high school bilingual education.'' The ban 
        includes a prohibition on Uyghur-language signage on 
        school grounds, as well as the use of Uyghur in 
        schools' public activities and educational management 
        work. In March 2017, state media announced that 
        authorities would strengthen preschool ``bilingual 
        education'' in the XUAR by building or expanding a 
        total of 4,387 ``bilingual kindergartens'' and hiring 
        10,000 ``bilingual teachers'' in 2017.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; According to research conducted by Human 
        Rights Watch and reporting by the journal Nature, 
        security personnel have been collecting DNA samples 
        from Uyghurs in the XUAR and from other people 
        throughout China on a massive scale, in many cases 
        without consent. International observers raised the 
        concern that officials may misuse the collected 
        biometric data to heighten security controls on the 
        Uyghur population, as officials build a database of 
        citizens' biometric information not limited to those 
        with a criminal background, as in other countries, and 
        lacking the kinds of legal safeguards other countries 
        implement to manage their DNA databases.
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Support efforts to raise greater public awareness of 
        human rights conditions in the XUAR, support 
        initiatives to protect Uyghur culture, increase avenues 
        for Uyghurs to protect their human rights, and 
        undertake more frequent human rights-
        focused visits to the XUAR.
          Call on the Chinese government to implement policies 
        in the XUAR that promote both security and human 
        rights, and that hold regional and local officials 
        accountable for human rights violations carried out in 
        the name of security. Urge Chinese officials to 
        establish mechanisms ensuring that officials uphold the 
        rule of law when implementing security procedures and 
        refrain from arbitrary detention or surveillance of 
        citizens. In addition, urge Chinese officials to 
        include human rights safeguards in laws and regulations 
        related to counterterrorism efforts, in consultation 
        with international human rights experts, and to avoid 
        broadly worded, ambiguous definitions of terrorism and 
        terrorism-related offenses.
          Call on the Chinese government to allow diplomats, 
        domestic and international journalists, and observers 
        greater freedom to report on XUAR-related issues, and 
        to allow domestic and international journalists to 
        freely express their views on government policy in the 
        XUAR, as provided for under Chinese and international 
        law.
          Call on the Chinese government to adhere to domestic 
        laws and regulations guaranteeing freedom of religious 
        belief as well as international standards guaranteeing 
        religious practice free from state restrictions.
          Urge Chinese officials to respect the rights of 
        Uyghurs and all Chinese citizens to travel freely 
        outside of China, in accordance with Article 12 of the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
        which China has signed and committed to ratify. Urge 
        Chinese authorities to return passports and other 
        legally obtained travel documents to XUAR residents.
          Call on the Chinese government to consult with non-
        Han Chinese parents, teachers, and students regarding 
        which language or languages of instruction should be 
        used in XUAR schools, from the preschool to the 
        university level. Call on Chinese officials to provide 
        parents and students a choice of instruction in the 
        Uyghur language and other non-Chinese languages 
        prevalent in the XUAR, as mandated in Article 4 of 
        China's Constitution and Article 10 of the PRC Regional 
        Ethnic Autonomy Law.
          Encourage U.S. companies conducting business or 
        investing in development initiatives in the XUAR to 
        promote equal opportunity employment for ethnic 
        minorities and to support development projects that 
        incorporate consultation with ethnic minorities 
        regarding the economic, political, and social impact of 
        such projects. Encourage U.S. companies investing in 
        XUAR business opportunities to actively recruit ethnic 
        minority candidates for employment positions, implement 
        mechanisms to eliminate hiring and workplace 
        discrimination, and urge Chinese counterparts to 
        provide equal opportunity employment to ethnic 
        minorities.
          Encourage U.S. companies conducting business or 
        investing in development initiatives in the XUAR to use 
        environmentally friendly business practices in their 
        operations and business strategies, and to promote 
        environmental preservation efforts in the region.
          Call on the Chinese government to cease its mass 
        collection of DNA samples from Uyghurs in the XUAR, and 
        end efforts to build a database of Chinese citizens' 
        biometric information, until it enacts and implements 
        privacy protections, mechanisms to ensure informed 
        consent, and legal safeguards for DNA database 
        management, in order to prevent official misuse of 
        collected biometric data. Privacy protections should 
        meet the standards contained in the International 
        Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has 
        signed but not ratified. Chinese officials should also 
        implement transparent regulations governing the 
        storage, sharing, and usage of biometric information, 
        and establish legal procedures citizens can use to 
        effectively challenge the collection of such 
        information.
                                 Tibet
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; There has been no formal dialogue between the 
        Dalai Lama's representatives and Chinese Communist 
        Party and government officials since the ninth round of 
        dialogue was held in January 2010. In February 2017, 
        Zhu Weiqun, Chairman of the Ethnic and Religious 
        Affairs Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
        Consultative Conference and former senior Party 
        official, said that the Chinese government would not 
        engage in dialogue with what he referred to as an 
        ``illegal group'' whose aim is to split China.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Party and government continued 
        implementing repressive policies in Tibetan autonomous 
        areas through the use of extensive and intrusive 
        surveillance, strict regulations and rules to restrict 
        Tibetans' fundamental rights, and pervasive displays of 
        police and military force. New high-level appointments 
        in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR)--Wu Yingjie as the 
        new Party Secretary of the TAR, and Qizhala (Che Dalha) 
        as the new governor--both of whom have extensive 
        experience in the region, are unlikely to lead to any 
        changes in policy or methods of governance in the TAR.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Chinese government restated its position 
        that only it has the right to decide the Dalai Lama's 
        successor. The current Dalai Lama reiterated his 
        position on his reincarnation, and underscored that it 
        is not a matter for the Chinese government or Party to 
        decide, but rather a matter reserved for himself, 
        Tibetan Buddhist leaders, and the Tibetan people.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Party and government continued to violate 
        the right of religious freedom of Tibetan Buddhist 
        monastics and laypersons through a system of pervasive 
        controls and restrictions on religious practice. The 
        expulsion of thousands of monks and nuns and 
        demolitions of homes at the famous Buddhist institutes 
        Larung Gar and Yachen Gar in Sichuan province were an 
        acute example during this reporting year of the Party's 
        crackdown on the right to religious freedom of Tibetan 
        Buddhists.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; An estimated 7,000 Tibetan pilgrims from 
        Tibetan areas of China attempted to attend an important 
        religious teaching given by the Dalai Lama in Bodh 
        Gaya, India, in early January 2017. In November 2016, 
        Chinese officials confiscated passports, issued 
        threats, and ordered Tibetans who had already traveled 
        to India and Nepal to return to China, violating their 
        rights of religious freedom and movement.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Self-immolations by Tibetans reportedly 
        focusing on political and religious issues continued 
        during this reporting year. As of August 21, 2017, 
        there were 5 known self-immolations in Tibetan 
        autonomous areas of China, 4 of which were confirmed to 
        be fatal, bringing the total number of such self-
        immolations by Tibetans living in China to 144 since 
        2009, 127 of which were reportedly fatal. As in the 
        past, the self-immolators publicly called for the long 
        life of the Dalai Lama, his return from exile, and 
        freedom for Tibet.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese authorities continued to detain and 
        imprison Tibetans for peacefully exercising their 
        rights to freedom of expression and opinion, including 
        advocacy for education in the Tibetan language. Tashi 
        Wangchug, an advocate for bilingual education in 
        Qinghai province, who has been detained since January 
        2016 following a November 2015 New York Times report 
        and video about his Tibetan language rights advocacy, 
        awaits trial for ``inciting separatism.''
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Encourage the Party and government to respect, as a 
        matter of the right of religious freedom, recognized 
        under Chinese and international law, that the decision 
        regarding the Dalai Lama's succession or reincarnation 
        must be reserved for the current Dalai Lama, Tibetan 
        Buddhist leaders, and the Tibetan people.
          Urge the Chinese government to recognize the role of 
        restrictive Party policies and government measures, and 
        the increasing securitization of Tibetan autonomous 
        areas of China, in Tibetan self-immolations and 
        protests. Urge the Chinese government to cease treating 
        the Dalai Lama as a security threat, and stress to the 
        government the importance of respecting and protecting 
        the Tibetan culture and language--policy changes that 
        would promote and protect social stability in Tibetan 
        areas.
          Encourage the Chinese government to respect the right 
        of Tibetans to travel domestically as well as 
        internationally, and to allow access to the Tibetan 
        autonomous areas of China to international journalists, 
        representatives of the United Nations and non-
        governmental organizations, and U.S. Government 
        officials.
          The Administration is urged to nominate, as soon as 
        practicable, an appropriate candidate to fill the 
        position of Under Secretary of State for Civilian 
        Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, who has 
        traditionally also simultaneously held the position of 
        Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, and the Senate 
        is urged to confirm forthwith.
          Urge the Chinese government to release Tibetan 
        language rights advocate Tashi Wangchug from detention, 
        withdraw the charges against him, and stress that 
        peacefully advocating for genuine bilingual education--
        a right recognized under Chinese and international 
        law--is not a crime.
          In interactions with Chinese officials, call for the 
        release of Tibetan political prisoners currently 
        detained or imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of 
        their human rights. The records of detained Tibetans in 
        the Commission's Political Prisoner Database--albeit an 
        incomplete picture of the extent of Tibetan detentions 
        and disappearances--provides a useful resource for such 
        interactions with Chinese officials. Urge the Chinese 
        government and its security forces to cease using 
        arbitrary detention, disappearance, beatings, torture, 
        and intimidation to suppress and punish Tibetans' 
        peaceful exercise of their rights.
          Urge the Chinese government to take fully into 
        account the views and preferences of Tibetans when 
        planning infrastructure, natural resource development, 
        settlement or resettlement projects, and tourist 
        attractions in the Tibetan areas of China.
          Continue to request that the Chinese government 
        invite an independent representative of an 
        international organization to meet with Gedun Choekyi 
        Nyima, the 11th Panchen Lama whom the Dalai Lama 
        recognized in 1995, and who has been held 
        incommunicado, along with his parents, since May 17, 
        1995.
                  Developments in Hong Kong and Macau
                                Findings
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; On March 26, 2017, Hong Kong's Election 
        Committee elected Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor as Hong 
        Kong's fourth Chief Executive. Observers reported that 
        during the nomination period and election campaign, 
        Chinese central government officials and 
        representatives pressured Election Committee members to 
        support Lam over other candidates. The Election 
        Committee's composition, and therefore the Chief 
        Executive election, is restricted to ensure support for 
        candidates approved by Chinese authorities, despite 
        provisions in Hong Kong's Basic Law guaranteeing 
        political autonomy and democratic development for Hong 
        Kong.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; After pro-democracy candidates gained seats in 
        the September 2016 Legislative Council (LegCo) 
        elections, the Chinese central government and Hong Kong 
        government moved to disqualify and remove from office 
        opposition legislators who had altered their oaths of 
        office. On November 7, 2016, the National People's 
        Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) issued an 
        interpretation of Hong Kong's Basic Law, holding that 
        oaths of office under Article 104 of the Basic Law are 
        legal commitments to both Hong Kong and China, and 
        prohibiting those whose oaths are determined to be 
        invalid from retaking the oath. Lawyers, legislators, 
        activists, and rights organizations strongly criticized 
        the NPCSC interpretation. The interpretation came while 
        a Hong Kong court was still considering the Hong Kong 
        government's case against two legislators-elect, Sixtus 
        ``Baggio'' Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-ching. The Hong 
        Kong judge hearing the case ruled in the government's 
        favor, finding that Leung and Yau ``declin[ed] to take 
        the LegCo Oath'' and disqualifying the two.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Following the NPCSC interpretation, the Hong 
        Kong government continued to pursue legal cases against 
        participants in the 2014 pro-democracy protests and 
        members of the political opposition. In July 2017, a 
        Hong Kong court ruled in the government's favor to 
        disqualify four additional legislators over their oaths 
        of office, and charged another with desecrating the 
        Chinese and Hong Kong flags in a protest inside the 
        LegCo chamber. Hong Kong police also charged nine 
        leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy protests, including 
        two sitting legislators, the day after the Chief 
        Executive election.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In August 2017, the Hong Kong government 
        successfully appealed to increase the sentences of 13 
        protesters as well as pro-democracy student leaders 
        Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow. Some 
        international rights and domestic pro-democracy groups 
        asserted the prosecutions were politically motived, 
        which the Hong Kong government and two local legal 
        organizations have denied.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Hong Kong journalists reported continuing 
        fears over press freedom in Hong Kong, noting concerns 
        over self-censorship, government restrictions on 
        reporters, and the 2015 abductions and disappearances 
        of five Hong Kong booksellers by mainland Chinese 
        authorities. The Hong Kong government continued to 
        restrict the ability of online media to freely report, 
        including during the December 2016 Chief Executive 
        Election Committee subsector elections and the March 
        2017 Chief Executive election, drawing criticism from 
        international and Hong Kong rights organizations.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Commission observed no progress in Macau 
        toward ``an electoral system based on universal and 
        equal suffrage . . .'' in line with provisions of the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
        as repeatedly recommended by the UN Human Rights 
        Committee. In December 2016, Macau's Legislative 
        Assembly revised the legislative electoral law to 
        disqualify candidates or legislators who do not swear 
        loyalty to Macau's Basic Law or who are ``not loyal'' 
        to Macau. Critics of the revisions questioned the need 
        for such legal requirements and expressed concern that 
        the new law would threaten the right to free and fair 
        elections.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Macau government continued to deny entry 
        to some pro-democracy politicians and activists from 
        Hong Kong. Macau authorities justified these denials by 
        asserting that the individuals barred from entering 
        Macau posed ``threats to Macau's internal stability and 
        security.'' One Macau pro-democracy activist suggested 
        that authorities wanted ``to prevent Hong Kong 
        activists from affecting the political atmosphere in 
        Macau.''
                            Recommendations
    Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials 
are encouraged to:
          Consider enacting the Hong Kong Human Rights and 
        Democracy Act (S. 417) to monitor the state of Hong 
        Kong's autonomy from mainland China and reaffirm U.S. 
        support for democratization in Hong Kong.
          Emphasize in meetings with Chinese and Hong Kong 
        officials that the continued erosion of Hong Kong's 
        autonomy under the ``one country, two systems'' 
        principle, and as guaranteed in the Sino-British Joint 
        Declaration and the Basic Law, threatens the 
        underpinnings of U.S. policy toward Hong Kong, 
        particularly Hong Kong's separate treatment under U.S. 
        law.
          Urge the Chinese and Hong Kong governments to restart 
        the electoral reform process and work toward 
        implementing Chief Executive and Legislative Council 
        elections by universal suffrage, in accordance with 
        Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law and Article 25 of 
        the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
        Rights (ICCPR).
          Call on the Chinese and Macau governments to set a 
        timeline for implementing elections in Macau for Chief 
        Executive and the Legislative Assembly by universal 
        suffrage, as required under Article 25 of the ICCPR and 
        repeatedly urged by the UN Human Rights Committee.

                                                        Summary

                                                Summary
                      Political Prisoner Database
                            Recommendations
    When composing correspondence advocating on behalf of a 
political or religious prisoner, or preparing for official 
travel to China, Members of Congress and Administration 
officials are encouraged to:
          Check the Political Prisoner Database (PPD) (http://
        ppdcecc.gov) for reliable, up-to-date information on a 
        prisoner or groups of prisoners. Consult a prisoner's 
        database record for more detailed information about the 
        prisoner's case, including his or her alleged crime, 
        specific human rights that officials have violated, 
        stage in the legal process, and location of detention 
        or imprisonment, if known.
          Advise official and private delegations traveling to 
        China to present Chinese officials with lists of 
        political and religious prisoners compiled from 
        database records.
          Urge U.S. state and local officials and private 
        citizens involved in sister-state and sister-city 
        relationships with China to explore the database, and 
        to advocate for the release of political and religious 
        prisoners in China.
                    A POWERFUL RESOURCE FOR ADVOCACY
    The Commission's 2017 Annual Report provides information 
about Chinese political and religious prisoners \5\ in the 
context of specific human rights and rule of law abuses. Many 
of the abuses result from the Chinese Communist Party's and 
government's application of policies and laws. The Commission 
relies on the Political Prisoner Database (PPD), a publicly 
available online database maintained by the Commission, for its 
own advocacy and research work, including the preparation of 
the Annual Report, and routinely uses the database to prepare 
summaries of information about political and religious 
prisoners for Members of Congress and Administration officials. 
The Commission invites the public to read about issue-specific 
Chinese political imprisonment in sections of this Annual 
Report, and to access and make use of the PPD at http://
ppdcecc.gov. (Information about the PPD is available at http://
www.cecc.gov/resources/political-prisoner-database.)
    The PPD received approximately 393,000 online requests for 
prisoner information during the 12-month period ending July 31, 
2017--an increase of approximately 282 percent over the 139,300 
requests reported in the Commission's 2016 Annual Report for 
the 12-month period ending July 31, 2016.\6\ During the 12-
month period ending in July 2017, the United States remained 
the country of origin for the largest share of requests for 
information, with approximately 50.4 percent of such requests. 
During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, France was in the 
second position, with approximately 2.7 percent of such 
requests, followed by India (2.4 percent), China (2.3 percent), 
Ukraine (2.1 percent), Brazil (2.1 percent), Japan (1.9 
percent), the United Kingdom (1.8 percent), Taiwan (1.7 
percent), and Romania (1.7 percent).
    Internet Protocol addresses that do not provide information 
about the name of the registrant or the type of domain were the 
source of the largest share of online requests for information 
during the Commission's 2017 reporting year, accounting for 
approximately 44.9 percent of the 393,000 requests for 
information in the 12-month period ending in July 2017. The 
approximate number of requests from other sources are as 
follows: Domains ending in .net were second, with 23.2 percent 
of requests for PPD information. Domains ending in .com were 
third, with 7.5 percent of online requests for information, 
followed by U.S. Government (.gov) domains with 4.6 percent, 
then by domains for Brazil (.br) with 1.9 percent, for the 
European Union (.eu) with 1.4 percent, for Italy (.it), for 
Germany (.de), and for Japan (.jp) with 1.1 percent each, and 
for India (.in) with 1.0 percent. Educational (.edu) domains 
accounted for 0.2 percent of requests for information, and 
domains ending in .org for less than 0.1 percent of requests. 
Domains for China (.cn) accounted for 0.1 percent of such 
requests.
                          POLITICAL PRISONERS
    The PPD seeks to provide users with prisoner information 
that is reliable and up-to-date. Commission staff members work 
to maintain and update political prisoner records based on the 
staff member's area of expertise. The staff seek to provide 
objective analysis of information about individual prisoners, 
and about events and trends that drive political and religious 
imprisonment in China.
    As of August 1, 2017, the PPD contained information on 
8,850 cases of political or religious imprisonment in China. Of 
those, 1,422 are cases of political and religious prisoners 
currently known or believed to be detained or imprisoned, and 
7,428 are cases of prisoners who are known or believed to have 
been released, who were executed, who died while imprisoned or 
soon after release, or who escaped. The Commission notes that 
there are considerably more than 1,422 cases of current 
political and religious imprisonment in China. The Commission 
staff work on an ongoing basis to add cases of political and 
religious imprisonment to the PPD.
    The Dui Hua Foundation, based in San Francisco, and the 
former Tibet Information Network, based in London, shared their 
extensive experience and data on political and religious 
prisoners in China with the Commission to help establish the 
database. The Dui Hua Foundation continues to do so. The 
Commission also relies on its own staff research for prisoner 
information, as well as on information provided by non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), other groups that specialize 
in promoting human rights and opposing political and religious 
imprisonment, and other public sources of information.
                   MORE POWERFUL DATABASE TECHNOLOGY
    The PPD has served since its launch in November 2004 as a 
unique and powerful resource for the U.S. Congress and 
Administration, other governments, NGOs, educational 
institutions, and individuals who research political and 
religious imprisonment in China, or who advocate on behalf of 
such prisoners. The July 2010 PPD upgrade significantly 
leveraged the capacity of the Commission's information and 
technology resources to support such research, reporting, and 
advocacy.
    In 2015, the Commission enhanced the functionality to the 
PPD to empower the Commission, the U.S. Congress and 
Administration, other governments, NGOs, and individuals to 
strengthen reporting on political and religious imprisonment in 
China and advocacy undertaken on behalf of Chinese political 
prisoners.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The PPD full text search and the basic search 
        both provide an option to return only records that 
        either include or do not include an image of the 
        prisoner.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; PPD record short summaries accommodate more 
        text as well as greater capacity to link to external 
        websites.
    The PPD aims to provide a technology with sufficient power 
to handle the scope and complexity of political imprisonment in 
China. The most important feature of the PPD is that it is 
structured as a genuine database and uses a powerful query 
engine. Each prisoner's record describes the type of human 
rights violation by Chinese authorities that led to his or her 
detention. These types include violations of the right to 
peaceful assembly, freedom of religion, freedom of association, 
and freedom of expression, including the freedom to advocate 
peaceful social or political change and to criticize government 
policy or government officials.
    The design of the PPD allows anyone with access to the 
Internet to query the database and download prisoner data 
without providing personal information to the Commission, and 
without the PPD downloading any software or Web cookies to a 
user's computer. Users have the option to create a user 
account, which allows them to save, edit, and reuse queries, 
but the PPD does not require a user to provide any personal 
information to set up such an account. The PPD does not 
download software or a Web cookie to a user's computer as the 
result of setting up such an account. Saved queries are not 
stored on a user's computer. A user-specified ID (which can be 
a nickname) and password are the only information required to 
set up a user account.

    Notes to Section I--Political Prisoner Database
    \5\ The Commission treats as a political prisoner an individual 
detained or imprisoned for exercising his or her human rights under 
international law, such as peaceful assembly, freedom of religion, 
freedom of association, free expression, including the freedom to 
advocate peaceful social or political change, and to criticize 
government policy or government officials. (This list is illustrative, 
not exhaustive.) In most cases, prisoners in the PPD were detained or 
imprisoned for attempting to exercise rights guaranteed to them by 
China's Constitution and law, or by international law, or both. Chinese 
security, prosecution, and judicial officials sometimes seek to 
distract attention from the political or religious nature of 
imprisonment by convicting a de facto political or religious prisoner 
under the pretext of having committed a generic crime. In such cases, 
defendants typically deny guilt but officials may attempt to coerce 
confessions using torture and other forms of abuse, and standards of 
evidence are poor. If authorities permit a defendant to entrust someone 
to provide him or her legal counsel and defense, as the PRC Criminal 
Procedure Law guarantees in Article 32, officials may deny the counsel 
adequate access to the defendant, restrict or deny the counsel's access 
to evidence, and not provide the counsel adequate time to prepare a 
defense.

                     Liu Xiaobo's Death in July 2017
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Imprisoned writer Liu Xiaobo--an advocate of democracy and non-violent
 political reform and China's only Nobel Peace Prize laureate \1\--died
 of liver cancer on July 13, 2017, in Shenyang municipality, Liaoning
 province, on medical parole.\2\ In the nine years prior to his death,
 he spent one year in pretrial detention and nearly eight years in
 prison on the charge of ``inciting subversion of state power'' for his
 coauthorship of the political treatise Charter 08 and several essays
 critical of the Chinese Communist Party and government.\3\ Granted
 medical parole on June 26, 2017,\4\ Liu remained under official
 surveillance at a hospital in Shenyang, serving his 11-year prison
 sentence,\5\ until his death.\6\ Liu's political activism dated back to
 the 1989 Tiananmen protests,\7\ for which Chinese authorities
 imprisoned him for 21 months; Liu subsequently served 3 years of
 reeducation through labor from 1996 through 1999 for criticizing
 government policies.\8\ Before his final detention in December 2008,
 Liu was a prolific essayist and poet \9\ and active within Chinese
 democracy and writers' advocacy communities.\10\
  International media outlets,\11\ human rights organizations and
 proponents,\12\ representatives of foreign governments,\13\ and the UN
 human rights commissioner,\14\ among others,\15\ expressed concern and
 censure regarding the Chinese government's treatment of Liu Xiaobo and
 his wife, the poet and artist Liu Xia. Condemnation focused on Chinese
 authorities' denial of Liu's request to receive medical treatment
 outside China \16\ and restrictions on access in the hospital for Liu's
 family.\17\ In the hospital, Liu reportedly wrote the forward to an
 unpublished collection of Liu Xia's photography,\18\ but it is unknown
 if he was able to speak openly about his conditions and medical
 treatment in prison, his political and familial concerns, his wishes
 with regard to his burial, or any other matters while under official
 surveillance.\19\ The government and Party continued to isolate Liu Xia
 in extralegal confinement after her husband's death, a condition that
 Chinese authorities imposed on her starting in October 2010 when the
 Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that it would award the 2010 Nobel
 Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo,\20\ despite ongoing calls for her
 release.\21\
  Observers commented on the combination of propaganda and control in
 the limited Chinese media coverage of Liu's illness and death.\22\ The
 Party-run English-language media outlet Global Times,\23\ together with
 other government and Party actors, engaged in an ``all-out government
 propaganda effort to counter domestic and international criticism,''
 according to Radio Free Asia.\24\ An academic group in Canada that
 studies censorship reported Chinese censors deleted text and images
 about Liu Xiaobo sent via the instant messaging tool WeChat before
 content reached intended recipients.\25\ Individuals who sought to
 commemorate Liu's death in China faced government harassment,\26\
 including at least nine detained by authorities in Guangdong, Fujian,
 and Liaoning provinces.\27\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
            International Standards on Freedom of Expression
    The Chinese government and Communist Party continued to 
restrict expression in contravention of international human 
rights standards, including Article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 19 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\28\ According to 
the ICCPR--which China signed \29\ but has not ratified \30\--
and as reiterated by the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, countries may impose certain restrictions or 
limitations on freedom of expression, if such restrictions are 
provided by law and are necessary for the purpose of respecting 
the ``rights or reputations of others'' or protecting national 
security, public order, public health, or morals.\31\ An 
October 2009 UN Human Rights Council resolution declares 
restrictions on the ``discussion of government policies and 
political debate,'' ``peaceful demonstrations or political 
activities, including for peace or democracy,'' and 
``expression of opinion and dissent'' are inconsistent with 
Article 19(3) of the ICCPR.\32\ The UN Human Rights Committee 
noted in a 2011 General Comment that restrictions on freedom of 
expression specified in Article 19(3) should be interpreted 
narrowly and that the restrictions ``may not put in jeopardy 
the right itself.'' \33\
                          Freedom of the Press
    International non-governmental organization Reporters 
Without Borders again ranked China among the five worst 
countries for press freedom in its annual Press Freedom 
Index.\34\ The Chinese government continued to be one of the 
worst jailers of professional and citizen journalists, with 
estimates of individuals in detention or imprisoned ranging 
from 38 \35\ to approximately 100.\36\
                  POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE NEWS MEDIA
    The government and Party continued to prioritize control of 
the press and media outlets for ``maintaining social and 
political stability, and in advancing [the Party's] policy 
goals.'' \37\ Party General Secretary Xi Jinping and state 
media continued to stress the ``principle of Party character'' 
(dangxing yuanze) in the media,\38\ echoing Xi's highly 
publicized statement in February 2016 that the news media 
``must be surnamed Party'' (bixu xing dang).\39\ At a November 
2016 meeting with the All-China Journalists Association (ACJA), 
Xi urged media workers to ``embody the principle of Party 
character,'' and ``be reliable for the Party and the people.'' 
\40\ The ACJA expounded on Xi's November speech in the Party's 
theoretical journal Seeking Truth,\41\ describing the function 
of ``supervision by public opinion'' (yulun jiandu)--an 
official phrase debuted in 1987 to give the media some scope to 
hold officials accountable in the public interest \42\--as a 
form of positive, mainstream propaganda to pacify the 
public.\43\ In a Xinhua report of the ACJA meeting, a senior 
China Central Television executive declared positive news 
reporting and ``supervision by public opinion'' are not 
contrary to each other.\44\ Moreover, the government has 
encouraged, and in some cases paid, social media users to post 
positive comments about the government and Party to influence 
public opinion.\45\ U.S.-based researchers have estimated these 
types of social media comments to number around 448 million per 
year.\46\
    International experts have cautioned that media serving 
``as government mouthpieces instead of as independent bodies 
operating in the public interest'' are a major challenge to 
free expression.\47\ In the case of the government and Party's 
ongoing crackdown on human rights lawyers and advocates that 
began in and around July 2015, official print and television 
media outlets broadcasted forced confessions of human rights 
lawyers this past year.\48\ State- and Party-run media outlets 
The Paper, Legal Daily, and Procuratorial Daily published an 
almost identical article under different bylines on December 16 
and 17, 2016, that ascribed a litany of criminal offenses to 
Jiang Tianyong,\49\ a lawyer disbarred in 2009 in connection 
with his rights defense efforts.\50\ On March 1, 2017, the 
Party-run media outlet Global Times published an article about 
Jiang that alleged he fabricated the torture claims of fellow 
rights lawyer Xie Yang.\51\ On March 2, Phoenix TV, a Hong 
Kong-based station, reportedly broadcast a video of Jiang 
admitting to this allegation.\52\ Chen Jian'gang, one of Xie 
Yang's defense lawyers, repudiated the Global Times article and 
the Phoenix TV broadcast and affirmed his role in transcribing 
Xie's claims in the course of three meetings.\53\ [See Section 
II--Criminal Justice and Section III--Access to Justice for 
more information on Xie Yang and Jiang Tianyong as well as 
developments in other cases of human rights lawyers and 
advocates detained as part of the July 2015 crackdown.]
         CENSORSHIP OF NEWS WEBSITES, HARASSMENT OF JOURNALISTS
    Pervasive government and Party control and censorship 
contributed to the shrinking space for journalism and public 
debate.\54\ The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) 
observed that ``the Communist Party of China . . . targeted the 
last few so-called `liberals' in the media'' in 2016, 
demonstrated by the closure of the reform-minded journal 
Yanhuang Chunqiu; \55\ the suspension of Consensus, a website 
known for open discussion and commentary; \56\ the shutdown of 
the economic think tank Unirule's website; \57\ and the two-
month suspension in October 2016 of Caixin news articles for 
republication in other news media.\58\ The government's 
punitive action against Caixin was for its alleged 
``problematic guidance'' (daoxiang wenti) \59\ in covering the 
opposition of some lawyers to revised administrative measures 
for law firms, which prohibited lawyers from using media 
outlets to publicize their cases.\60\
    The Party regularly issues propaganda directives to control 
Chinese news media through the Central Propaganda Department 
and its lower level bureaus. Censored topics include Tibet, 
Taiwan, and Falun Gong, as well as coverage of ``sensitive'' 
political anniversaries and events, such as the anniversary of 
the 1989 Tiananmen protests and their violent suppression.\61\ 
This past year, some of the official censorship directives 
reposted to the U.S.-based website China Digital Times \62\ 
targeted Liu Xiaobo's medical parole \63\ and reports on 
natural disasters,\64\ public health,\65\ and pollution.\66\ In 
June 2017, the Central Propaganda Department reportedly ordered 
Chinese news media not to report independently on a landslide 
in Sichuan province; journalists reportedly received government 
press releases upon which to base their reports.\67\ An 
international journalists' consortium selected nine 
investigative news stories published in domestic Chinese media 
outlets in 2016 that illustrated a range of public interest 
reporting.\68\ China Digital Times, however, posted official 
censorship directives for at least three of those news articles 
or their subject matter.\69\
    In spite of government-imposed censorship, media experts 
have pointed to a ```semipolitical' sphere,'' in which some 
Chinese journalists continued to cover ``. . . pertinent social 
issues such as official accountability, gender equality, and 
social welfare, amongst others.'' \70\ Another commentator 
remarked that the ``highly personal focus'' of this form of 
reporting may ``strip many articles of their larger, possibly 
charged, political contexts.'' \71\ For example, two Party-
affiliated media outlets,\72\ Beijing News and Sixth Tone, 
reported on the case of a man forced by local family planning 
authorities in Yunnan province to undergo a vasectomy in 
February 2017.\73\ Beijing News published an interview with the 
man without additional analysis of the incident.\74\ While 
Sixth Tone noted the government's ``strict birth control 
measures since the 1980s . . .,'' \75\ it emphasized local 
``unorthodox family planning practices,'' rather than examining 
national family planning policy more broadly.\76\ [For more 
information on this case and the implementation of population 
planning policy, see Section II--Population Control.]
    Several Chinese journalists and media outlets argued for 
the protection of journalists' physical safety, government 
accountability, and guarantees of their right to report on 
events in the public interest following incidents of physical 
violence against and obstruction of journalists on assignment 
this past year.\77\ In December 2016, township-level police in 
Qiqiha'er municipality, Heilongjiang province,\78\ reportedly 
beat up two journalists from the official media outlet China 
Education News who were investigating whistleblower allegations 
about a local school's lunch program.\79\ Beijing News demanded 
accountability from local officials for the violence against 
its reporters during a February 2017 report on a fire in 
Beijing municipality, noting that information on major 
emergencies is in the public interest.\80\ Xinhua reporters 
demanded accountability in the face of official obstruction 
when they attempted to report on the case of a teenager who may 
have committed suicide or been bullied to death in April 2017 
at a school in Sichuan province.\81\

               Criminal Prosecution of Citizen Journalists
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Given the heavy government censorship of official and market-oriented
 media outlets, citizen journalists \82\ in China are a key source of
 information on labor protests,\83\ petitioning the government for
 redress of grievances, and other rights defense efforts.\84\ According
 to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, the detentions this past year of the
 founders of websites that featured citizen journalist reports
 demonstrated the government's drive ``to criminalize those who document
 human rights abuses and advocate for better human rights protections.''
 \85\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Criminal Prosecution of Citizen Journalists--Continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Lu Yuyu, founder of ``Not the News.'' In August 2017, the
   Dali Municipal People's Court in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture,
   Yunnan province, sentenced citizen journalist Lu Yuyu to four years
   in prison on the charge of ``picking quarrels and provoking
   trouble.'' \86\ The same court reportedly released his collaborator
   and girlfriend Li Tingyu on bail \87\ sometime after holding a closed
   trial for her on the same charge in April 2017.\88\ Lu began
   documenting mass incidents, such as labor protests and strikes,
   across China in 2011; he and Li posted their work to Chinese and
   international social media platforms under the names ``Not the News''
   and ``Wickedonna.'' \89\ During Lu's trial in June 2017, Lu rejected
   the prosecution's accusation that he had fabricated information about
   mass incidents, emphasizing his aim to document history and make it
   available for public access.\90\
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Liu Feiyue, founder of Civil Rights &amp;amp; Livelihood Watch
   website. In November 2016, authorities from Suizhou municipality,
   Hubei province, detained Liu Feiyue, editor of the human rights
   website Civil Rights &amp;amp; Livelihood Watch (CRLW),\91\ arresting him in
   December on the charge of ``subversion of state power.'' \92\ Radio
   Free Asia reported that authorities added the charge ``illegally
   supplying state secrets or intelligence for an overseas entity'' in
   August 2017 to the case against him.\93\ CRLW has reported on a range
   of human rights violations in China, such as protests and
   demonstrations by petitioners and military veterans, and on the
   forcible commitment of individuals without mental illness to
   psychiatric facilities as a ``stability maintenance'' tool.\94\
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Huang Qi, founder of 64 Tianwang website. In November 2016,
   public security authorities from Sichuan province detained Huang Qi,
   the founder of 64 Tianwang, and subsequently arrested him in December
   on the charge of ``illegally supplying state secrets or intelligence
   for an overseas entity.'' \95\ Based in Chengdu municipality,
   Sichuan, Huang previously served prison sentences for posting
   articles about the violent suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen protests
   and Falun Gong,\96\ and for aiding the parents of children who died
   when poorly constructed school buildings collapsed during the 2008
   earthquake in Sichuan.\97\
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; 64 Tianwang volunteers. A number of volunteer citizen
   journalists for 64 Tianwang \98\ were detained this past year or
   served prison sentences. In September 2016, authorities in several
   locations in China detained five 64 Tianwang volunteers who planned
   to report on the G20 Summit in Hangzhou municipality, Zhejiang
   province.\99\ In June 2017, authorities criminally detained one of
   these volunteers, Yang Xiuqiong, for disclosing information about
   Huang Qi's case.\100\ In the cases of two additional 64 Tianwang
   volunteers, authorities in Zhuji municipality, Zhejiang, reportedly
   released Yang Dongying on November 5, 2016, upon her completion of a
   sentence of one year and six months related to her criticism of local
   police.\101\ Wang Jing continued to serve a four-year sentence in
   Jilin province related to her 2014 64 Tianwang report on a self-
   immolation incident at Tiananmen Square, despite multiple requests
   for medical parole due to brain cancer.\102\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   CHALLENGES FOR FOREIGN JOURNALISTS
    Several international organizations issued reports on the 
difficult working conditions for foreign journalists in China, 
including PEN America (September 2016),\103\ the Foreign 
Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC, November 2016),\104\ and 
the International Federation of Journalists (January 
2017).\105\ These reports detailed a range of methods used by 
the Chinese government to restrict and harass foreign 
journalists, including, as PEN America noted, ``physical abuse, 
physical and online surveillance, denying or threatening to 
deny reporters' visas, restricting reporters' access to certain 
areas of the country, and harassment of sources and news 
assistants.'' \106\ Selected cases from this reporting year 
included the following:
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Detention. In September 2016, local officials 
        reportedly briefly detained foreign journalists 
        covering protests in Wukan village, Lufeng county, 
        Shanwei municipality, Guangdong province.\107\ 
        Plainclothes public security officers reportedly 
        assaulted several journalists from Hong Kong media in 
        Wukan and detained them for five hours at the Lufeng 
        Public Security Bureau before expelling them from 
        Lufeng.\108\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Harassment. A BBC correspondent and crew faced 
        at least two incidents of harassment and manhandling 
        while trying to interview an independent candidate for 
        a local election in Beijing municipality and a 
        petitioner in Hunan province in November 2016 \109\ and 
        March 2017,\110\ respectively.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Surveillance. A Los Angeles Times reporter 
        described tight surveillance of foreign journalists on 
        a government-organized tour in 2016 to Tibetan 
        autonomous areas of Sichuan province, noting: 
        ``Everything was recorded. The foreign journalists 
        recorded the tour guides, and the Chinese reporters 
        recorded the foreign ones. The shadowy men recorded us 
        all.'' \111\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Blocked access. The government also continued 
        to block online access to the New York Times, 
        Bloomberg, Reuters, the Economist, and Time, as well as 
        to YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.\112\ The 
        U.S. company Apple removed the New York Times 
        application (app) from its stores in China in December 
        2016, reportedly at the request of Chinese 
        authorities.\113\
    Chinese citizens continued to be at risk of sanctions for 
speaking with foreign journalists. The April 2017 judgment 
against human rights lawyer Li Heping cited his having spoken 
with foreign media as one of several activities that allegedly 
``subverted state power.'' \114\ Radio Free Asia reported that 
following its article in March 2017 on petitioning activities 
by a group of private school, substitute, and kindergarten 
teachers, security authorities had ``chats'' with some of the 
teachers, surveilled their phone calls and social media posts 
(blocking some messages), and threatened detention if the 
teachers spoke with foreign reporters again.\115\ The threat of 
retaliation, moreover, has resulted in a chilling effect: \116\ 
According to PEN America, Chinese expert sources were ``less 
willing to share information or opinions with foreign media for 
fear of government reprisal.'' \117\ Specific examples of 
reprisals reported on during this past year included the 
following:
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Imprisonment. In November 2016, the Xinjiang 
        Uyghur Autonomous Region High People's Court upheld a 
        19-year sentence against Zhang Haitao, an electronics 
        salesman and rights defender, for ``inciting subversion 
        of state power'' and ``stealing, spying, buying and 
        illegally supplying state secrets or intelligence for 
        an overseas entity.'' \118\ Zhang criticized the 
        government's ethnic policies, among other issues, in 
        his online writings and interviews with overseas news 
        media.\119\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Detention. Tashi Wangchug remained in pretrial 
        detention on the charge of ``inciting separatism'' for 
        his efforts to promote Tibetan language education in 
        Yushu (Kyegudo) city, Yushu (Yulshul) Tibetan 
        Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai province.\120\ In March 
        2016, authorities arrested him on the ``separatism'' 
        charge due to his contact with New York Times 
        journalists whose two articles and a short documentary 
        about him were published in the New York Times in 
        November 2015.\121\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Travel denial. In March 2017, security 
        authorities in Qianyang county, Baoji municipality, 
        Shaanxi province, reportedly refused to issue a 
        passport and Hong Kong-Macau travel permit to Lu 
        Dongli, a long-time petitioner, due allegedly to his 
        activities connected to the July 2015 crackdown on 
        human rights lawyers and legal advocates and for 
        speaking with foreign reporters.\122\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Dismissal. In April 2017, the Chinese Academy 
        of Governance, a training institute for government 
        officials in Beijing,\123\ removed a retired professor 
        from an expert committee at the institute for 
        presenting ``flawed viewpoints'' during interviews with 
        foreign media in 2016.\124\
 Intensifying Government and Party Control of the Internet and Social 
                                 Media
                               CENSORSHIP
    The government and Party employ methods to implement 
Internet and social media policies aimed at controlling the 
flow of information in order to, as one expert said, ``guide 
the narrative in the direction that the state determines.'' 
\125\ Reports this past year identified an intensification of 
control over the Internet and social media platforms, 
attributing it, in part, to the upcoming 19th National Congress 
of the Chinese Communist Party.\126\ The PRC Cybersecurity Law 
took effect on June 1, 2017,\127\ giving online censorship 
``the weight of law,'' according to the Wall Street 
Journal.\128\ Also in June, the Cyberspace Administration of 
China reportedly ordered the closure of 90 entertainment and 
gossip social media accounts, purportedly to bring the service 
providers into compliance with the Cybersecurity Law and 
``ensure political security.'' \129\
    Social media providers in China play a major role in 
carrying out censorship as required by the government's legal 
and regulatory requirements.\130\ The chairman of Weibo, a 
Twitter-like social media platform, reportedly stated that 
Weibo had been censoring fake news for years,\131\ following 
the news that the U.S. company Facebook had taken steps to stop 
the spread of misinformation.\132\ The domestic company Tencent 
shut down 45,000 WeChat accounts for a six-month period--
approximately September 2016 through February 2017--allegedly 
for rumor-mongering, though some WeChat group facilitators 
speculated that Tencent closed their groups because of 
politically sensitive content.\133\ [For more information on 
the PRC Cybersecurity Law, see Section III--Commercial Rule of 
Law.]
    Citizen Lab, an information technology and human rights 
research center based in Canada, published findings on content 
filtering of social media platforms WeChat and Weibo, observing 
a high level of flexibility and speed in response to issues and 
events deemed politically sensitive.\134\ Liu Xiaobo's death; 
\135\ the names of human rights lawyers, including many of 
those ensnared in the July 2015 crackdown; \136\ and 
information about the January 2017 Kalachakra, a major Tibetan 
Buddhist teaching convened by the Dalai Lama in India, were 
among the range of keywords, keyword combinations, and images 
filtered by censors during this reporting year.\137\ The 
consequences of the censorship are serious, according to 
Citizen Lab: in the case of the rights defenders, international 
advocacy via social messaging ``fail[s] to reach domestic 
audiences in China due to information control practices.'' 
\138\ Restricted access to information about events like the

                      CLOSING DOWN ACCESS TO VPNS
    The Chinese government took aggressive action \140\ during 
this reporting year to limit online users' attempts to 
circumvent the Chinese government's censorship hardware and 
software--its ``Great Firewall'' \141\--by means of virtual 
private networks (VPNs) to access to prohibited websites and 
social media platforms.\142\ These efforts included a notice in 
January 2017 from the Ministry of Industry and Information 
Technology (MIIT) requiring government approval for VPN service 
providers in China \143\ and the publication by the Chongqing 
Municipality Public Security Bureau in March of administrative 
punishment guidelines for improper corporate or personal VPN 
use within Chongqing, a province-level municipality.\144\ 
Commentators raised concerns that these regulatory efforts 
``effectively [put] most of the country's providers of VPNs in 
violation of the law.'' \145\ According to Bloomberg News, MIIT 
authorities moved to prohibit individual use of VPN technology, 
directing state-run telecommunications companies in July to 
block such access by February 2018.\146\ MIIT refuted 
Bloomberg's report via The Paper, asserting it had not issued a 
directive toward that goal; rather, the targets of its January 
2017 notice were VPN service providers lacking official 
approval.\147\ In a similar vein, a provincial branch of the 
Cyberspace Administration of China contacted five e-commerce 
platforms in August, warning them to stop selling illegal 
VPNs.\148\ In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), 
authorities took criminal measures against VPN users: Fei Chang 
Dao, a blog that monitors freedom of speech in China, reported 
the case of Tian Weiguo, whom authorities in Kuitun city, Yili 
(Ili) Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, XUAR, sentenced to three 
years' imprisonment on the charge of ``inciting ethnic hatred'' 
after he circumvented the government's censorship technology to 
post comments on external social media platforms.\149\ In 
another case from the XUAR, in October 2016, police in Changji 
Hui Autonomous Prefecture reportedly detained an individual for 
downloading VPN software, referring to it as ``violent and 
terrorist software.'' \150\ [For more information on this case, 
see Section IV--Xinjiang.]
                  Punishing Citizens' Free Expression
    The government and Party continued to violate international 
standards on the right to freedom of expression, in part by 
using laws and regulations to prosecute speech the government 
finds politically sensitive.\151\ In addition to the Party and 
government censorship mechanisms used to control official 
narratives discussed earlier in this section, the Commission 
observed judicial and legislative developments this past year 
that aimed to protect the Party and government's version of the 
``national historical narrative.'' \152\ In October 2016, the 
Supreme People's Court (SPC) released four civil law model 
cases about the purported libel of several World War II and 
Korean War era figures, commenting that the protection of 
heroes' reputations and honor are linked to ``core socialist 
values'' and the protection of the public interest.\153\ SPC 
President Zhou Qiang subsequently urged provincial high 
people's court presidents at a January 2017 meeting to 
``develop judicial interpretations for cases that harm the 
reputations of heroes and historical figures; to protect 
leaders and heroic martyrs according to law; and to resolutely 
defend the Party and People's Liberation Army's glorious 
history.'' \154\ In March, the National People's Congress 
passed a code of civil law, which took effect on October 1, 
2017; the law contains a provision to impose civil liability on 
those who harm the ``names, portraits, reputations and honor'' 
of heroes and martyrs.\155\ This provision was a late addition 
to the draft civil code,\156\ reportedly in reaction to one of 
the model cases.\157\
    This past year, authorities took punitive action against 
Chinese officials, journalists, writers, publishers, and 
university professors, including disciplinary action, job 
termination, detention, and imprisonment for speech critical of 
President and Party General Secretary Xi Jinping,\158\ former 
leader Mao Zedong,\159\ and political campaigns and events of 
modern Chinese history.\160\ A scholar observed that the 
sensitivity around criticism of Xi Jinping and the Party 
reflects ``a leadership worried about political agitation and 
social unrest as disruptive reforms advance.'' \161\ Fei Chang 
Dao posted the court judgments of citizens sentenced to prison 
terms related to political opinions shared on social media 
platforms on the charges of ``picking quarrels and provoking 
trouble'' \162\ and ``defamation.'' \163\ In April 2017, a 
court in Shandong province sentenced long-time petitioner Wang 
Jiangfeng to two years' imprisonment on the charge of ``picking 
quarrels and provoking trouble'' after sharing material within 
two private social media chat groups that allegedly ``seriously 
disparaged the individual reputations of Mao Zedong and Xi 
Jinping.'' \164\ An ethnic Korean rights advocate Kwon Pyong 
(Quan Ping) ``disappeared'' on October 1, 2016, shortly after 
posting online a photo of himself wearing a T-shirt that 
allegedly mocked Xi Jinping.\165\ Authorities in Yanji city, 
Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin province, later 
indicted Kwon on the charge of ``inciting subversion of state 
power.'' \166\

                             Worker Rights
                              Trade Unions
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) remains 
the only trade union organization permitted under Chinese 
law,\1\ and Chinese labor advocates and international observers 
report that the ACFTU does not effectively represent workers' 
rights and interests.\2\ The ACFTU constitution describes the 
ACFTU as a ``mass organization'' \3\ under the leadership of 
the Chinese Communist Party and ``an important social pillar of 
state power.'' \4\ During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, 
leading union officials held concurrent positions in the 
government and Party,\5\ including ACFTU Chairman Li Jianguo, 
who also served as Vice Chairman of the National People's 
Congress Standing Committee and a member of the Party Central 
Committee Political Bureau.\6\ At the enterprise level, company 
management typically selects union representatives, often 
selecting company managers to represent workers.\7\ Earlier 
experiments with elections of ACFTU representatives and other 
union reforms have reportedly stalled in recent years.\8\ 
Restrictions on workers' rights to freely establish and join 
independent trade unions violate international standards set 
forth by the International Labour Organization (ILO),\9\ 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\10\ International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\11\ and International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\12\
                         Collective Bargaining
    This past year, workers' right to collective bargaining 
remained limited in law and in practice. Provisions in the PRC 
Labor Law, PRC Labor Contract Law, and PRC Trade Union Law 
provide a legal framework for negotiating collective 
contracts,\13\ but these laws designate the Party-controlled 
ACFTU as responsible for negotiating with employers and signing 
collective contracts on behalf of workers.\14\ The PRC Trade 
Union Law requires trade unions to ``whole-heartedly serve 
workers''; \15\ in practice, however, Chinese labor advocates 
and other experts report that the ACFTU and its lower level 
branches do not adequately represent workers' interests,\16\ 
often siding instead with enterprise management.\17\ In the 
absence of effective union representation,\18\ some Chinese 
labor non-governmental organizations (NGOs) had shifted their 
focus in recent years, from providing legal aid and other 
services to training workers in collective bargaining.\19\ A 
December 2015 crackdown on labor rights advocates and NGOs in 
Guangdong province, however, has reportedly had a chilling 
effect on labor advocates' ability to promote collective 
bargaining rights.\20\ As a member of the ILO, China is 
obligated to respect workers' rights to collective 
bargaining.\21\
                             Civil Society
    The situation of labor rights advocates and NGOs has 
worsened in recent years, and government suppression of labor 
NGOs continued during this reporting year. Grassroots labor 
NGOs have existed in China for decades, offering legal aid, 
helping workers seek redress for workplace injuries and unpaid 
wages, educating workers about their legal rights, and 
providing a variety of social services to workers.\22\ In 
recent years, some labor NGOs also began training workers in 
collective bargaining.\23\ Authorities have long subjected 
labor NGOs to various forms of harassment,\24\ but labor rights 
advocates reported increasing pressure from authorities 
beginning in late 2014.\25\ In December 2015, authorities 
detained at least 18 labor advocates affiliated with several 
labor NGOs \26\ in a crackdown that domestic and international 
observers described as ``unprecedented.'' \27\ Labor advocates 
and NGOs reportedly continued to face heightened surveillance 
and pressure from authorities this past year.\28\ In May 2017, 
authorities in Jiangxi province detained three Chinese men 
conducting research on behalf of a U.S.-based labor NGO 
regarding working conditions in factories producing shoes for 
international brands.\29\ Authorities reportedly released all 
three on bail in June.\30\ In addition, scholar Anita Chan 
warned that the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs' 
Activities, which took effect on January 1, 2017,\31\ may 
further hinder the work of labor NGOs in China, as many of them 
rely on sources of funding outside of mainland China.\32\
                     SENTENCING OF LABOR ADVOCATES
    In fall 2016, a Guangdong province court sentenced four 
labor advocates detained in the December 2015 crackdown: Zeng 
Feiyang,\33\ Zhu Xiaomei,\34\ Tang Jian,\35\ and Meng Han.\36\ 
All four advocates were current or former staff of Guangdong-
based labor NGOs,\37\ and Zeng was the director of the Panyu 
Workers' Services Center.\38\ On September 26, 2016, the Panyu 
District People's Court in Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong, 
found Zeng, Zhu, and Tang guilty of ``gathering a crowd to 
disturb social order.'' \39\ The court sentenced Zeng to three 
years' imprisonment, suspended for four years; and sentenced 
Zhu and Tang both to one year and six months' imprisonment, 
suspended for two years.\40\ Authorities reportedly released 
them following the trial.\41\ Though released, a suspended 
sentence means the advocates may be constrained in their 
ability to continue their labor advocacy work.\42\ On November 
3, the same court found Meng Han guilty of ``gathering a crowd 
to disturb social order,'' \43\ sentencing him to one year and 
nine months' imprisonment.\44\ Authorities reportedly released 
Meng upon completion of his sentence on September 3, 2017.\45\ 
The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association stated that 
authorities seemed to have targeted these labor advocates for 
``being involved in a labour dispute,'' and noted that 
targeting individuals for such activities ``constitutes a 
serious interference with civil liberties in general and with 
trade union rights in particular.'' \46\
                     CHILLING EFFECT ON LABOR NGOS
    The detention and sentencing of labor advocates has 
reportedly had a chilling effect on labor NGOs this past 
year.\47\ Labor advocates and NGOs have maintained low 
profiles,\48\ and NGOs have reportedly canceled trainings and 
reduced programs.\49\ Legal scholar Aaron Halegua noted in an 
October 2016 report that the December 2015 crackdown has made 
labor NGOs reluctant to continue collective bargaining 
work.\50\ Some international scholars have argued that in 
targeting these labor advocates, Chinese authorities were 
signaling that labor NGOs should stop working on collective 
bargaining altogether.\51\ Panyu Workers' Services Center, the 
organization reportedly at the center of the December 2015 
crackdown,\52\ had trained and advised workers on collective 
bargaining.\53\ The Chinese government's restrictions on labor 
NGOs contravene international standards on freedom of 
association, including those found in the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work.\54\ [For more information on 
NGOs in China, see Section III--Civil Society.]
                      Worker Strikes and Protests
    Following reports of a significant increase in worker 
strikes and protests in the previous reporting year,\55\ the 
number of worker actions appeared to remain high this past 
year, though the Commission did not observe reliable 
statistics. The Hong Kong-based NGO China Labour Bulletin 
(CLB), which compiles data on worker actions collected from 
traditional news and social media,\56\ documented 2,663 strikes 
in 2016.\57\ This is fewer than the 2,776 strikes CLB 
documented in 2015, but approximately double the 1,379 strikes 
documented in 2014.\58\ According to their data, 76 percent of 
worker actions in 2016 involved wage arrears.\59\ The 
construction sector saw the largest number of strikes, 
accounting for 40 percent of the total, followed by 
manufacturing with 23 percent, and retail and services with 15 
percent.\60\ CLB statistics from the first half of 2017 
indicated similar trends: 40 percent of worker actions sampled 
by CLB researchers were in the construction sector and 22 
percent were in the retail and services sectors; 66 percent of 
sampled strikes in the first half of 2017 involved wage 
arrears.\61\ CLB researchers cautioned that their data were 
limited and likely represented a small fraction of the total 
number of strikes in China.\62\ Some local government figures 
indicate that the number of strikes may be much higher: The 
Party-run People's Daily reported that in the first 10 months 
of 2016, labor and social security inspection bureaus across 
Zhejiang province handled 1,701 labor-related ``sudden 
incidents'' (tufa shijian),\63\ a term the government often 
uses to refer to strikes and protests; \64\ China National 
Radio, an official broadcaster, reported that in 2016, 
Chongqing municipality handled 1,113 ``sudden incidents'' 
involving 64,500 workers.\65\ The Chinese government does not 
publish national statistics on strikes.\66\
    This past year, labor advocates noted increasing difficulty 
in finding information on strikes in China due to the chilling 
effect of the December 2015 crackdown on labor NGOs and 
tightening government control of the media. In January 2017, 
one Guangdong-based advocate told Radio Free Asia (RFA) that in 
the past two years he observed fewer official media reports on 
strikes, and noted that censorship of information relating to 
strikes on social media had also increased.\67\ An advocate 
from the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions believes that 
because mainland labor NGOs are keeping a low profile following 
the 2015 detention of labor advocates, some observers have the 
``mistaken impression'' that strikes have decreased.\68\ In 
addition, in June 2016, authorities targeted an independent 
source of information on strikes and protests in China, 
detaining citizen journalists Lu Yuyu and Li Tingyu, who 
documented strikes and protests.\69\ On August 3, 2017, the 
Dali City People's Court in Yunnan province reportedly 
sentenced Lu to four years' imprisonment for ``picking quarrels 
and provoking trouble.'' \70\ The same court tried Li in secret 
in April, and authorities reportedly released her on bail on an 
unknown date.\71\ [For more information on censorship and media 
restrictions, see Section II--Freedom of Expression.]
    During this reporting year, government responses to worker 
strikes and protests appeared to be mixed, and some labor 
advocates asserted that the government's suppression of strikes 
had increased. The Commission observed reports of disputes in 
which Chinese authorities resolved disputes in court \72\ or 
assisted in finalizing negotiations between workers and 
management,\73\ as well as disputes in which authorities did 
not get involved.\74\ The Commission also observed reports of 
cases in which police responded violently to worker strikes and 
protests.\75\ According to CLB data, police responded in some 
way to approximately 26 percent of worker actions in 2016.\76\ 
In January 2017, labor advocates from Hong Kong and mainland 
China told RFA that mainland authorities had increased 
monitoring and suppression of worker strikes and protests.\77\
    Chinese law does not protect workers' right to strike.\78\ 
A February 2017 study in the Journal of Industrial Relations 
examined nearly 900 court cases between 2008 and 2015 in which 
employers dismissed workers for their involvement in a strike; 
the study found that courts deemed strikes to be unlawful in 64 
percent of cases, typically holding that striking violated 
workplace rules, and thus was acceptable grounds for 
dismissal.\79\ The International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, which China has signed and ratified, 
guarantees workers' right to strike,\80\ and a December 2016 
report from the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association noted 
that the Committee ``has always recognized the right to strike 
by workers and their organizations as a legitimate means of 
defending their economic and social interests.'' \81\
                              Child Labor
    The Commission continued to observe reports of the use of 
child labor in China this past year.\82\ In one widely reported 
case, clothing manufacturers in Changshu city, Suzhou 
municipality, Jiangsu province, had hired workers from Yunnan 
province through recruiters, and many of the workers were under 
the age of 16.\83\ According to the Party-run Chuncheng Evening 
Post, employers beat the children for working too slowly and 
withheld pay and identification documents to prevent them from 
quitting.\84\ Such actions are indicators of forced labor, 
according to the ILO.\85\ Authorities detained at least two 
individuals following the media reports.\86\ Domestic laws 
generally prohibit the employment of minors under the age of 
16,\87\ and China has ratified the two fundamental ILO 
conventions on the elimination of child labor.\88\ The ILO 
Country Office for China and Mongolia noted that the Chinese 
government has not released official statistics on child labor 
in China, nor has it reported any cases to the ILO.\89\ [For 
more information on forced labor in China, see Section II--
Human Trafficking.]
                     Occupational Health and Safety
    During this reporting year, government data showed a 
continued decline in both workplace accidents and deaths, 
though the Commission continued to observe reports of lax 
enforcement of work safety laws and regulations. The State 
Administration of Work Safety (SAWS) reported in January 2017 
that workplace accidents and deaths declined 5.8 and 4.1 
percent, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015.\90\ SAWS also 
reported that accidents and deaths in the coal, fireworks, and 
transportation industries decreased during the same period, but 
did not provide statistics.\91\ Although China has numerous 
work safety laws and regulations,\92\ the Commission continued 
to observe reports of lax enforcement of those laws.\93\
    Official statistics indicate that pneumoconiosis--a lung 
disease caused by inhaling dust \94\--is the most prevalent 
form of occupational illness in China; moreover, pneumoconiosis 
sufferers reportedly face difficulty obtaining workers' 
compensation. The National Health and Family Planning 
Commission (NHFPC) reported in December 2015 that 
pneumoconiosis accounted for roughly 90 percent of all cases of 
occupational illness in China in 2014.\95\ Although the 
Commission did not observe officially published statistics for 
2015 or 2016, the NHFPC noted in January 2016 that experts 
expected rates of pneumoconiosis to remain high in the near 
future.\96\ A December 2016 report by Beijing-based non-
governmental organization (NGO) Love Save Pneumoconiosis \97\ 
found that pneumoconiosis sufferers had difficulty obtaining 
workers' compensation, as only 9.5 percent of surveyed 
pneumoconiosis sufferers had signed formal contracts with 
employers, and 84.8 percent had not obtained workers' 
compensation insurance.\98\ The Party-run newspaper Workers' 
Daily reported in March 2017 that pneumoconiosis sufferers 
often had to spend significant time and money to obtain proper 
diagnoses and receive compensation.\99\ In October 2016, 
authorities in Ganluo county, Liangshan Yi Autonomous 
Prefecture, Sichuan province, briefly detained several former 
miners who suffer from pneumoconiosis for petitioning and 
protesting to demand workers' compensation.\100\
    This past year, the government issued several documents 
setting targets and outlining plans for improving occupational 
health and safety. The National Human Rights Action Plan of 
China (2016-2020), released in September 2016, set the goal of 
reducing workplace accident deaths by 10 percent by 2020.\101\ 
In December 2016, the State Council General Office issued the 
National Occupational Illness Control Plan (2016-2020), with 
stated goals including ``establishing and improving 
occupational illness control structures for employer 
responsibility, administrative supervision, enterprise self-
discipline, worker participation, and societal monitoring.'' 
\102\ In January 2017, the State Council General Office also 
issued the 13th Five-Year Plan on Work Safety calling for 
reductions in workplace accidents and deaths in various 
categories, including reducing the number of deaths in 
workplace accidents by 10 percent.\103\ A January 2017 National 
Bureau of Economic Research working paper evaluating a previous 
policy aimed at reducing workplace deaths found evidence that 
local governments had manipulated statistics on workplace 
deaths in order to meet their yearly targets.\104\
                              Wage Arrears
    Wage arrears remained a significant problem this past year, 
and were reportedly a growing problem in some sectors of the 
economy. Wage arrears have long been a problem for China's 281 
million migrant workers,\105\ particularly in the construction 
industry.\106\ In 2016, 76 percent of all strikes documented by 
China Labour Bulletin involved wage arrears.\107\ The Supreme 
People's Procuratorate reported in March 2017 that the number 
of prosecutions for failure to pay wages had increased 26.5 
percent in 2016 compared to 2015.\108\ Although a January 2016 
opinion issued by the State Council General Office set the goal 
of containing the problem of migrant worker wage arrears by 
2020,\109\ in January 2017, an official from the Ministry of 
Human Resources and Social Security told the People's Daily 
that slowing economic growth had increased the risk of wage 
arrears in the construction industry as well as other 
sectors.\110\ International and domestic media reported this 
past year that while wage arrears remained a problem in 
traditional sectors of the economy, they were also becoming a 
problem in new industries such as Internet commerce.\111\ Vice 
Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Qiu Xiaoping 
told People's Daily in January 2017 that one of the reasons 
wage arrears remained a problem was that the penalties for 
companies that failed to pay workers were ``especially low.'' 
\112\
                              Unemployment
    China's economic growth rate continued to decline, and the 
official unemployment rate reportedly did not provide an 
accurate picture of employment in China. According to the 
National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), in 2016, China's 
rate of GDP growth was 6.7 percent.\113\ This was the slowest 
rate in 26 years,\114\ though international economists 
questioned the accuracy of China's GDP growth estimates.\115\ 
International news media reported declining employment in some 
types of manufacturing,\116\ as well as layoffs, 
underemployment, and early retirement in state sectors such as 
steel and coal.\117\ Other economic indicators suggested that 
both the service sector and manufacturing overall continued to 
grow at a modest pace.\118\ The official urban registered 
unemployment rate at the end of 2016 was 4.02 percent,\119\ but 
this figure only included those urban residents who officially 
registered as unemployed, rather than the number of unemployed 
individuals nationwide.\120\ A study by the Hunan Provincial 
Bureau of Statistics cautioned that the current methodology 
excludes many of China's migrant workers,\121\ while one 
official at a county-level human resources and social security 
bureau noted increasing levels of ``hidden unemployment'' in 
rural areas.\122\ In his June 2017 report to the United 
Nations, Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights 
Philip Alston emphasized that accurate statistics are necessary 
for ``successful'' economic policymaking.\123\ The 2010 PRC 
Social Insurance Law stipulates that workers and employers 
contribute to an unemployment insurance fund.\124\ NBS, 
however, reported that as of late 2016, only around 23 percent 
of workers contributed to unemployment insurance funds,\125\ 
and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security 
(MOHRSS) further reported in March 2017 that only around 17 
percent of migrant workers contributed to unemployment 
insurance funds.\126\
                            Social Insurance
    During this reporting year, workers' rates of social 
insurance coverage showed some improvement, but overall 
remained low.\127\ According to the PRC Social Insurance Law, 
workers are entitled to five forms of social insurance: basic 
pension insurance, health insurance, work-related injury 
insurance, unemployment insurance, and maternity 
insurance.\128\ Under the law, employers and workers are 
required to contribute to basic pension, health, and 
unemployment insurance; in addition, employers are required to 
contribute to work-related injury and maternity insurance on 
workers' behalf.\129\ According to NBS and MOHRSS, from 2015 to 
2016, workers' compensation coverage increased slightly overall 
from 27.7 to 28.2 percent,\130\ but decreased slightly for 
migrant workers from 27.0 to 26.7 percent participating.\131\ 
Employment-based pension insurance coverage rates increased 
from 45.7 percent to 48.8 percent for all workers, and 
increased from 20.1 percent to 20.7 percent for migrant 
workers.\132\ Employer-based health insurance coverage remained 
below 40 percent for all workers and below 20 percent for 
migrant workers.\133\ Unemployment and maternity insurance 
coverage remained below 25 percent for all workers.\134\ In 
addition to low levels of coverage, international experts noted 
that because local governments manage social insurance funds, 
many migrant workers face bureaucratic obstacles when 
transferring their social insurance benefits to new 
jurisdictions.\135\ Some migrant workers reportedly preferred 
not to participate in social insurance programs, as they were 
not confident their contributions would be available to them in 
the future.\136\
                             Dispatch Labor
    The Commission continued to observe reports this past year 
\137\ of employers violating domestic laws and regulations on 
the use of dispatch workers.\138\ In order to cut costs, firms 
often use dispatch labor (laowu paiqian)--workers hired through 
subcontracting agencies.\139\ Provisions in the PRC Labor 
Contract Law stipulate that employers pay dispatch workers the 
same as full-time workers doing similar work, and generally 
only employ dispatch workers on a temporary, auxiliary, or 
substitute basis.\140\ The 2014 Interim Provisions on Dispatch 
Labor further required that dispatch labor make up no more than 
10 percent of a firm's total workforce by March 2016.\141\ 
Despite these requirements, Chinese legal professionals found 
that dispatch workers continued to receive lower wages and 
benefits than their directly employed counterparts, and often 
faced difficulties holding firms and dispatch agencies 
accountable for labor law violations.\142\ Moreover, firms are 
reportedly using ``outsourced labor'' (laowu waibao), another 
form of subcontracted labor, to get around the requirement to 
reduce the percentage of dispatch laborers they employ.\143\ 
According to a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Labour 
and Social Security, although the number of dispatch workers in 
China has declined in recent years, the use of workers who are 
`` `outsourced in name, dispatch in reality' is rampant.'' 
\144\
          ``Employment Relationships'' and China's Labor Laws
    This past year, many categories of workers were unable to 
benefit fully from the protections provided under Chinese 
law,\145\ including workers above the retirement age,\146\ 
student workers and interns,\147\ and independent contractors 
or informal workers.\148\ The PRC Labor Law and PRC Labor 
Contract Law apply to workers who have an ``employment 
relationship'' (laodong guanxi) with their employers.\149\ 
Workers past the retirement age and students, however, are not 
able to legally form an official ``employment relationship,'' 
\150\ and thus do not receive the protection of these labor 
laws.\151\ Interns are protected by separate regulations 
requiring that internships be relevant to students' plans of 
study and prohibiting interns from working more than eight 
hours per day.\152\ Yet the Commission continued to observe 
reports of vocational schools sending students to work long 
hours for low pay in jobs unrelated to their fields of 
study,\153\ and one former recruiter said such practices were 
common.\154\ Moreover, contract workers and casual or informal 
employees such as delivery drivers, window washers, and street 
cleaners \155\ typically do not receive social insurance 
benefits, and are often unable to benefit from labor law 
protections due to difficulties proving the existence of an 
``employment relationship.'' \156\

                              Introduction
    During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, Chinese 
government and Communist Party officials continued to abuse 
criminal law and police power to further their priorities in 
``maintaining social stability'' and perpetuating one-party 
rule at the expense of individual freedoms.\1\
                   Ongoing Use of Arbitrary Detention
    Extralegal and extrajudicial forms of detention that 
restrict a person's liberty without judicial oversight \2\ 
violate Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR) \3\ and Article 9(1) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\4\ Some commonly used forms 
of extralegal and extrajudicial detention in China are 
described below.
                              BLACK JAILS
    ``Black jails'' are detention sites that operate outside of 
China's judicial and administrative detention systems.\5\ After 
the Chinese government abolished the reeducation through labor 
system in 2013,\6\ the Commission continued to observe Chinese 
authorities' use of ``black jails'' \7\--including a type known 
as ``legal education centers'' \8\--to suppress individuals 
such as Falun Gong practitioners \9\ and petitioners.\10\ The 
Commission also observed multiple reports of Chinese 
authorities detaining rights advocates in ``black jails'' prior 
to and during the annual meetings of the National People's 
Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
in March 2017.\11\ [For more information on Falun Gong 
practitioners and petitioners, see Section II--Freedom of 
Religion and Section III--Access to Justice.]
                        PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTIONS
    Despite provisions in the PRC Mental Health Law \12\ and 
related regulations \13\ aimed at protecting citizens from such 
abuse, Chinese authorities continued to forcibly commit 
individuals to psychiatric facilities for political reasons 
\14\ and used psychiatric hospital staff as instruments of 
``maintaining social stability.'' Civil Rights &amp;amp; Livelihood 
Watch (CRLW), a human rights monitoring group based in China, 
documented a case in Anhui province in which personnel of a 
psychiatric facility participated in ``stability maintenance'' 
efforts by preventing a petitioner from traveling to Beijing 
municipality.\15\ CRLW observed that despite new laws and 
regulations aimed at improving mental health services, 
individuals who need mental health care lack access, while 
authorities continue to abuse the system to control petitioners 
and others defending their rights.\16\
        CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY DISCIPLINARY PROCESS (SHUANGGUI)
    Under an investigation process known as ``double 
designation'' (shuanggui), Party investigators may summon Party 
members \17\ to appear for interrogation at a designated time 
and place for alleged Party discipline violations such as 
corruption.\18\ The shuanggui process is within the Party's 
control and outside China's legal system; it is a form of 
extralegal detention \19\ that contravenes rights guaranteed 
under the UDHR and the ICCPR.\20\ Human Rights Watch reported 
in December 2016 that prolonged solitary confinement, ill 
treatment, and threats against family members during shuanggui 
remained common.\21\ In March 2017, a Canada-based media outlet 
published a report detailing the torture and abuse that Wang 
Longming, a former manager of a state-run tobacco factory, 
suffered during his nearly two-month stay in shuanggui in 
2015.\22\ According to the report, authorities subjected Wang 
to numerous forms of torture, including sleep deprivation and 
being forced to sit on a small stool for 20 hours.\23\
    In December 2016, the National People's Congress Standing 
Committee announced a pilot reform program that establishes 
supervisory commissions (jiancha weiyuanhui) in three province-
level jurisdictions to take over the functions of investigating 
corruption and other official misconduct, functions orginally 
performed by three government bodies.\24\ The program 
authorizes the supervisory commissions to carry out 12 
investigative measures including interrogation (xunwen) and 
confinement (liuzhi), without specifying limitations on the 
length of time or the manner of implementation.\25\ According 
to legal experts, the implications of this new program, such as 
whether it will replace shuanggui \26\ and how the detention 
authority will be exercised,\27\ remain unclear.
                              Criminal Law
           USE OF CRIMINAL LAW TO PROSECUTE RIGHTS ADVOCATES
    This past year, the Chinese government continued to use 
broadly defined crimes to punish individuals such as rights 
advocates, lawyers, and members of some ethnic minority groups. 
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (Working Group) 
considers a detention arbitrary ``even if it is authorized by 
law . . . if it is premised upon an arbitrary piece of 
legislation or is inherently unjust, relying for instance on 
discriminatory grounds.'' \28\ During the Commission's 2017 
reporting year, the Working Group found the detentions of 
rights lawyer Xia Lin \29\ and religious leader Wu Zeheng \30\ 
to be arbitrary.\31\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Endangering state security. The Chinese 
        government continued to prosecute individuals under 
        ``endangering state security'' charges for peacefully 
        exercising their rights.\32\ Articles 102 to 112 of the 
        PRC Criminal Law--listing offenses including 
        ``subversion of state power,'' ``separatism,'' and 
        ``espionage''--are collectively referred to as crimes 
        of ``endangering state security,'' some of which carry 
        the death penalty.\33\ In one recent example, in March 
        2017, the Foshan Intermediate People's Court in Foshan 
        municipality, Guangdong province, convicted Su Changlan 
        \34\ and Chen Qitang \35\ of ``inciting subversion of 
        state power'' and sentenced them to three years' and 
        four years and six months' imprisonment, respectively, 
        for ``attacking the socialist system'' by means of 
        spreading rumors and committing libel on the 
        Internet.\36\ Authorities in Foshan detained Su and 
        Chen in October and November 2014, after they voiced 
        support for the fall 2014 pro-democracy protests in 
        Hong Kong.\37\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Extortion. Authorities continued \38\ to 
        charge rights advocates and petitioners \39\ with 
        ``extortion,'' \40\ the elements of which are undefined 
        in the PRC Criminal Law and judicial 
        interpretations.\41\ In cases of petitioners \42\ 
        allegedly committing ``extortion'' against local 
        government entities,\43\ judgments published during 
        this past year show that some courts viewed petitioning 
        as a means of threat.\44\ Relying on information from 
        the Chinese judiciary's judgment database, a China-
        based legal scholar observed an increase in such cases 
        between 2013 and 2016, from about 25 to 280 across 
        China.\45\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Gathering a crowd to disturb social order and 
        gathering a crowd to disturb order in a public place. 
        Authorities continued to invoke Articles 290 and 291 of 
        the PRC Criminal Law \46\ against citizens \47\ in 
        manners that infringed on their rights, including the 
        freedom of assembly and religion.\48\ For example, in 
        April 2017, the Changji Municipal People's Court in 
        Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang Uyghur 
        Autonomous Region, tried five individuals \49\ on the 
        charge of ``gathering a crowd to disturb social order'' 
        for participating in unauthorized Christian 
        gatherings.\50\ In February 2017, the Supreme People's 
        Court issued measures specifying that individuals who 
        participate in sit-in protests, distribute print 
        materials, chant slogans, or hold up banners outside a 
        courthouse are subject to criminal prosecution under a 
        range of criminal offenses, including Articles 290 and 
        291 of the PRC Criminal Law.\51\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Picking quarrels and provoking trouble. This 
        past year, authorities prosecuted petitioners and 
        rights advocates \52\ for ``picking quarrels and 
        provoking trouble.'' \53\ A U.S.-based legal scholar 
        observed that ``the vagueness of the `crime' . . . 
        allows police unlimited discretion to detain and arrest 
        offenders for almost any action.'' \54\ The Chinese 
        government expanded this provision to cover Internet 
        activities in 2013 \55\ and has since used it to 
        prosecute individuals for online speech.\56\ For 
        example, in September 2016, the Gangzha District 
        People's Court in Nantong municipality, Jiangsu 
        province, sentenced Shan Lihua \57\ to two years and 
        three months' imprisonment partly in connection with 
        her online activities advocating women's rights and 
        helping victims of forcible demolition and 
        relocation.\58\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Illegal assembly, procession, or 
        demonstration. In December 2016, the Haifeng County 
        People's Court in Shanwei municipality, Guangdong, 
        convicted eight individuals \59\ of ``illegal assembly, 
        procession, or demonstration,'' \60\ among other 
        crimes, and imposed sentences ranging from 2 years' to 
        10 years and 6 months' imprisonment for participating 
        in protests that lasted for 85 days in Wukan village, 
        Donghai subdistrict, Lufeng city, Shanwei, calling on 
        the government to release Wukan's elected village 
        committee head Lin Zulian (also known as Lin Zuluan) 
        and to address villagers' complaints regarding official 
        corruption in village land sales.\61\ [For more 
        information on the Wukan village protests, see Section 
        III--Institutions of Democratic Governance.]
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Other criminal offenses. This past year, 
        authorities accused rights advocates and religious 
        practitioners of other criminal offenses, including 
        ``illegal business activity,'' \62\ ``defamation,'' 
        \63\ ``misappropriation of funds,'' \64\ ``sabotaging 
        production and operation,'' \65\ ``organizing and using 
        a cult to undermine implementation of the law,'' \66\ 
        and ``disturbing court order.'' \67\
 Ongoing Challenges in the Implementation of the Criminal Procedure Law
                          COERCED CONFESSIONS
    The Chinese government and Communist Party emphasized the 
procuratorate's supervisory role over criminal investigation 
and continued to improve implementation of the existing legal 
provisions \68\ that address the problem of investigators' use 
of coercion and overreliance on confession in criminal 
cases.\69\ In October 2016, five central government bodies 
issued a joint opinion that obligates the procuratorate in 
certain important cases to ensure the legality of evidence 
before the conclusion of an investigation by directly 
questioning the criminal suspect about the existence of a 
coerced confession or illegal evidence collection 
practices.\70\ In June 2017, the same government bodies issued 
provisions specific to the exclusion of evidence obtained by 
torture.\71\ A U.S.-based legal scholar, however, noted the 
ineffectiveness of the provisions because ``they maintain a 
narrow view of what type of evidence should be excluded and 
also continue to allow subsequent non-coerced confessions after 
an initial coerced one.'' \72\ In March 2017, Cao Jianming, 
Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), 
reported that in 2016, the procuratorate corrected 34,230 cases 
of illegal investigation practices, such as extracting 
confessions by torture, but did not report any instance of 
criminal prosecution of investigators who engaged in abuse.\73\ 
Despite these official pronouncements, reports of coerced 
confession continued to emerge this past year,\74\ with some 
indicating that procurators participated in the practice.\75\ 
[For more information on custodial torture and abuse, see 
Torture and Abuse in Custody in this section.]
           RESIDENTIAL SURVEILLANCE AT A DESIGNATED LOCATION
    Under Article 73 of the PRC Criminal Procedure Law (CPL), 
authorities can enforce a form of detention known as 
``residential surveillance at a designated location'' (RSDL) 
\76\ to detain a person at an undisclosed location for up to 
six months in cases involving charges of ``endangering state 
security'' (ESS), terrorism, or serious bribery.\77\ A U.S.-
based scholar noted that RSDL is susceptible to abuse if 
authorities apply ESS charges as a pretext to forgo criminal 
suspects' rights.\78\ Reports that emerged this past year 
indicate that torture and abuse took place in the enforcement 
of RSDL.\79\ In some cases, authorities reportedly enforced 
RSDL even when they did not allege any of the three types of 
offenses that permit this form of detention.\80\ In the case of 
Jiang Tianyong, a disbarred rights lawyer who disappeared on 
November 21, 2016, authorities reportedly did not provide his 
family notice of him being detained under RSDL within the 
timeframe required by law \81\ and refused to disclose his 
detention location or to allow his family and lawyers to meet 
with him.\82\ The location of Jiang's detention remained 
unknown for over six months.\83\
                           ACCESS TO COUNSEL
    This past year, the Chinese government denied access to 
legal counsel to some individuals, particularly those detained 
in politically sensitive cases. Individuals charged with ESS 
crimes--which the government often used against rights 
advocates \84\--continued to face obstacles in meeting with 
their lawyers.\85\ In cases involving ESS, terrorism, and 
serious bribery (``three categories of cases'' (sanlei 
anjian)),\86\ Article 33 of the PRC Lawyers Law as amended in 
2012 \87\ qualifies detainees' right to meet with their lawyers 
by referencing the PRC Criminal Procedure Law, which requires 
lawyers to obtain approval from the agency investigating the 
case but does not provide for a specific timeframe within which 
the agency must decide on such an application.\88\ In the case 
of detained lawyer Jiang Tianyong,\89\ his lawyers questioned 
the legality of the authorities' decision to repeatedly deny 
Jiang access to counsel on ESS grounds yet permit a news 
reporter to interview him.\90\
    This past year, authorities obstructed or denied access to 
counsel for those detained in cases involving rights advocacy 
or the exercise of internationally recognized freedoms,\91\ and 
in some cases harassed or intimidated their lawyers.\92\ Liu 
Zhengqing, lawyer of democracy advocate Chen Yunfei,\93\ said 
that after a December 2016 court hearing in which he 
represented Chen before the Wuhou District People's Court in 
Chengdu municipality, Sichuan province, court officials 
detained him for four hours, searched his briefcase, and seized 
his computer.\94\ Another report from this past year indicated 
that the lawyer initially retained by the family of petitioner 
Ding Meifang \95\ withdrew representation after government 
officials reportedly asked the lawyer to demand that Ding make 
a guilty plea.\96\
    In May 2017, authorities detained rights lawyer Chen 
Jian'gang, his wife, and their two minor children when they 
were traveling in Yunnan province.\97\ Previously, Chen 
publicized accounts of authorities torturing his client \98\ 
Xie Yang,\99\ a rights lawyer detained as part of the crackdown 
against rights lawyers and advocates that began in and around 
July 2015 (July 2015 crackdown).\100\
                       OTHER DUE PROCESS CONCERNS
    The following examples highlight certain due process 
violations that infringe on individuals' substantive rights:
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Prolonged pretrial detention. Although the PRC 
        Criminal Procedure Law permits law enforcement 
        officials to extend the prescribed investigation 
        period,\101\ prolonged pretrial detention constitutes a 
        violation of international human rights standards.\102\ 
        Some detainees reportedly remained in prolonged 
        pretrial detention,\103\ in some cases because 
        authorities extended the investigation period or 
        canceled scheduled hearings.\104\ One example suggests 
        that cooperation with the authorities can reduce a 
        detainee's time in detention: Zhang Wanhe,\105\ whom 
        authorities detained in June 2015 outside a courthouse 
        where she participated in an advocacy event,\106\ said 
        that authorities tried and then released her in January 
        2017 after she admitted guilt and terminated her 
        lawyer, whereas Yao Jianqing,\107\ whom authorities 
        detained at the same event, did not cooperate as Zhang 
        did and remained in pretrial detention.\108\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Delay in judicial proceedings. Delays in 
        judicial proceedings likewise lengthen a person's time 
        in detention.\109\ In one example, after military 
        veteran and petitioner Gao Hancheng \110\ appealed a 
        June 2016 conviction for ``gathering a crowd to disturb 
        social order,'' the Wuhan Intermediate People's Court 
        in Hubei province, after three adjournments, held a 
        pretrial conference for the first time on April 25, 
        2017, and did not issue a trial date.\111\ While in 
        detention, Gao reportedly had a stroke and lost 
        mobility in January 2017; the prolonged detention 
        reportedly contributed to the deterioration of his 
        health.\112\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Procedural irregularities in law enforcement. 
        Reports from this past year indicate that law 
        enforcement authorities in some localities did not 
        present proper documentation before restricting 
        citizens' liberty or conducting a search \113\ in 
        violation of China's domestic laws.\114\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Draft Amendment to the PRC People's Police Law
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In December 2016, the Ministry of Public Security issued a draft
 amendment \115\ to the PRC People's Police Law \116\ that includes
 proposed statutory codification of existing regulations defining the
 scope of police authority to carry and use firearms.\117\ The draft
 amendment seeks to authorize police to use firearms in five situations,
 including when someone commits or escapes after having committed an
 offense that seriously endangers ``state security'' or ``public
 safety,'' and when someone damages property that the government has
 designated as a target of protection.\118\ Noting the broad definitions
 of ``state security'' and ``public safety'' under Chinese law, Human
 Rights Watch (HRW) criticized the draft amendment for being
 inconsistent with international standards that prohibit law enforcement
 officials from using firearms unless it is necessary to prevent
 ``imminent threat of death or serious injury . . ..'' \119\ HRW also
 pointed out the lack of meaningful limitations on other police powers
 covered by the proposed amendment.\120\ Radio Free Asia, for example,
 published multiple reports of such abuse of police power this past
 year.\121\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Torture and Abuse in Custody
    This past year, reports continued to emerge that Chinese 
authorities tortured and abused individuals in detention,\122\ 
including rights lawyers and advocates detained as part of the 
July 2015 crackdown. Family members of rights lawyer Li Chunfu 
\123\ reported that he returned home in January 2017 in a 
severely altered physical and mental state, exhibiting paranoia 
and schizophrenic behavior \124\ as well as having damage to 
his neck and spine.\125\ Li told his wife that authorities had 
drugged him daily for the first portion of his detention.\126\ 
Rights advocate Wu Gan \127\ and rights lawyer Wang Yu \128\ 
both reported that authorities tortured them with methods 
including sleep deprivation and shackling of their hands and 
feet.\129\ The China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group 
reported in January 2017 that rights lawyers Wang Quanzhang 
\130\ and Li Heping \131\ had been tortured by electric shock 
to the point of fainting during the period they spent in 
RSDL.\132\ Li Heping's wife also said that authorities had 
forcibly medicated Li for 22 months with a drug that caused 
``muscle pains, lethargy, and blurred vision'' and shackled him 
for a month in such a way that he could not stand upright.\133\ 
Other reports from this past year described additional 
instances in which authorities administered medication as a 
means of torture.\134\
    Rights lawyer Xie Yang also gave detailed descriptions of 
the torture he suffered during his detention in connection with 
the July 2015 crackdown. In January 2017, Xie told his lawyers 
that during the portion of his detention spent under 
residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL),\135\ 
authorities deprived him of sleep, interrogated him for periods 
of over 20 hours, forced him to sit on stacked stools, punched 
him, kicked him, and kneed him in his abdomen and lower 
extremities on multiple occasions.\136\ Xie noted that 
officials carried out these actions directly under the camera 
in the room to avoid being recorded.\137\ Xie also identified 
over 20 officials who participated in his abuse \138\ and 
revealed that officials repeatedly pressured him to confess and 
to keep quiet about his torture.\139\ Xie said in a letter that 
he reported the torture to two procurators, but they did not 
make a record of it.\140\ Party- and state-run media claimed 
that another detained lawyer fabricated the accounts of Xie's 
torture,\141\ but Xie's lawyer affirmed their veracity.\142\
                      Inadequate Medical Treatment
    The Commission further observed reports of authorities 
denying or failing to provide detainees adequate medical 
treatment,\143\ which may amount to torture \144\ or violation 
of other international human rights standards.\145\ For 
example, political reform advocate and Nobel Peace Prize 
laureate Liu Xiaobo died of liver cancer in July 2017 while 
serving an 11-year sentence for ``inciting subversion of state 
power.'' \146\ Liu's health condition prompted questions of 
``whether the cancer could have been diagnosed earlier, or 
whether poor treatment contributed to his declining health.'' 
\147\
        Lack of Accountability for Officials Involved in Torture
    The Commission did not observe reports of Chinese 
authorities imposing criminal liability on the perpetrators of 
abuse in the above-mentioned cases, or in the case of Lei Yang. 
A resident of Beijing municipality, Lei Yang died in May 2016 
shortly after plainclothes police officers in Beijing took him 
into custody.\148\ In December, authorities announced their 
decision not to criminally prosecute the officers despite their 
finding that the officers committed ``dereliction of duty'' 
\149\ and caused Lei's death by twice restraining him, 
including by kneeling and stomping on his neck and face, 
wrapping an arm around his neck, and pressing on the back of 
his neck.\150\ Chinese law requires criminal prosecution if a 
government official causes the death of one or more persons as 
a result of dereliction of duty.\151\ The Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, which China signed and ratified,\152\ requires a 
State Party to prosecute the perpetrator of torture or other 
forms of mistreatment.\153\
      Draft Law Affecting Public Security Bureau Detention Centers
    The Chinese government issued a draft law that proposes to 
limit the use of shackling in detention, but legal experts 
question its effectiveness in curbing custodial abuse in 
general because it does not improve transparency or resolve an 
apparent conflict by continuing to allow police to run 
detention centers. In a January 2017 ruling, the Supreme 
People's Court (SPC) affirmed a lower court's dismissal of a 
compensation claim filed by a former death-row inmate who 
alleged that he suffered disfiguration and loss of mobility in 
his limbs as a result of wearing shackles during 
detention.\154\ The SPC found that the treatment alleged by the 
claimant was consistent with the PRC Public Security Bureau 
Detention Center Regulations (PSB Detention Center 
Regulations),\155\ which require every death-row inmate to be 
shackled.\156\ The UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment 
of Prisoners, however, prohibit the use of chains or irons as 
restraints and limit other kinds of restraints to the extent 
necessary for reasons such as prevention of escape during 
transfer, and of personal injury or property damage.\157\ In 
June 2017, the Ministry of Public Security issued a draft law 
that would replace the PSB Detention Center Regulations.\158\ 
The draft law limits the use of shackles to what is necessary 
for ``preventing danger,'' bringing the current legal framework 
closer to international standards in this respect.\159\ Lawyers 
and legal scholars, however, are skeptical about the draft 
law's effectiveness in curbing custodial abuse in general 
because it lacks provisions that improves transparency and it 
continues to give police the power to control PSB detention 
centers, an arrangement that conflicts with the role of police 
as investigators.\160\
                          Wrongful Conviction
    In the past reporting year, the Chinese government made 
some efforts to address the problem of wrongful conviction, but 
custodial abuse and political interference continued to be 
subjects of concern.\161\ According to a scholar, false 
confessions--obtained mainly through torture--are the 
predominant cause of wrongful convictions, and police 
obstruction in procuratorial investigations undermined efforts 
to curb this practice.\162\ To prevent local influence on 
investigations, the Supreme People's Procuratorate reportedly 
drafted provisions allowing criminal petitions (xingshi shensu) 
involving possible grave injustice to be transferred to 
agencies in other locations.\163\ The Commission did not 
observe the publication of these provisions.
    In February 2017, the Supreme People's Court (SPC) reported 
that courts across China in 2016 corrected 11 cases of wrongful 
conviction involving 17 individuals.\164\ In one case, the 
SPC's second circuit tribunal rescinded the murder and rape 
convictions of Nie Shubin, who was executed in 1995, after 
another person confessed to the crimes in 2005.\165\ The court 
concluded that, due to inconsistencies in Nie's confession, it 
could not preclude the possibility that investigators induced 
or directed him to confess, but it declined to find that 
torture took place.\166\
    While the SPC reported that authorities continued to grant 
compensation in wrongful conviction cases,\167\ a report citing 
official statistics notes that fewer courts disclosed state 
compensation statistics between 2014 and 2016, which a Chinese 
legal scholar said was inconsistent with central authorities' 
stated goal of improving judicial protection against wrongful 
conviction.\168\
                             Death Penalty
              LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN DEATH PENALTY CASES
    The Chinese government's claim of limited use of the death 
sentence \169\ remained unverifiable as authorities continued 
to treat the number of executions as a state secret. An April 
2017 Amnesty International report estimated that the number of 
executions in China remained in the thousands, exceeding the 
number for all other countries combined, and reported that the 
Chinese government continued its policy of nondisclosure of 
death sentence statistics on state secrecy grounds.\170\ 
Amnesty International found that death penalty-related 
documents published in China's official judicial document 
database represented a fraction of the execution reports 
retrieved from a search engine in China--about 5 percent in 
2015 and 8.5 percent in 2016--which in turn is a fraction of 
credible estimates given by non-governmental organizations and 
scholars.\171\
                 JUDICIAL REVIEW OF DEATH PENALTY CASES
    In the 10-year period after the Supreme People's Court 
(SPC) regained exclusive authority to review death penalty 
cases,\172\ the low rate of legal representation in death 
penalty cases and the lack of a uniform legal standard of 
review have remained issues of concern. While the PRC Criminal 
Procedure Law requires legal representation in cases where the 
defendants may receive the death penalty,\173\ there is no 
corresponding requirement in death penalty review cases before 
the SPC.\174\ A study of judicial opinions published between 
2014 and 2016 shows that legal counsel participated in 22 out 
of 255 (8.63 percent) death penalty review cases, and the 
majority of the defendants involved had junior high school or 
lower levels of education.\175\ A legal practitioner reported 
difficulty in preparing an effective defense due to the lack of 
a uniform standard of review and further noted that some SPC 
judges disposed of cases without addressing the points raised 
by defense counsel.\176\
                ORGAN HARVESTING FROM EXECUTED PRISONERS
    This past year, the Commission did not observe any 
rulemaking efforts to ban harvesting organs from executed 
prisoners,\177\ but authorities reportedly imposed sanctions on 
persons involved in one case of organ transplantation from an 
executed prisoner. Amnesty International observed that China is 
likely ``still sourcing organs from prisoners on death row'' as 
of 2017, noting that senior Chinese health official Huang 
Jiefu, who spoke at an international summit on organ 
trafficking held at the Vatican in February 2017, did not deny 
that the practice continued.\178\ Huang told reporters he was 
sure that there were some violations of China's ban on 
harvesting organs from executed prisoners, given China's 
population size.\179\ In October 2016, Huang said at a 
conference in Beijing municipality that he received information 
about a paramilitary police hospital transplanting a kidney 
from an executed prisoner to a Canadian patient for 30,000 
Canadian dollars (approximately US$21,900).\180\ Huang said he 
relayed the information to the Ministry of Public Security and 
the National Health and Family Planning Commission, after which 
authorities revoked the license of the doctor and the hospital, 
sanctioned the hospital director, and detained court personnel 
who facilitated the transaction.\181\

                          Freedom of Religion
           International and Chinese Law on Religious Freedom
    Both Chinese and international law provide guarantees for 
religious freedom. Despite these guarantees, the Commission 
continued to observe widespread and systematic violation of the 
principles of religious freedom as Chinese authorities 
exercised broad discretion over the religious practice of 
Chinese citizens.
    Under international law, freedom of religion or belief 
encompasses both the right to form, hold, and change 
convictions, beliefs, and religion--which cannot be 
restricted--and the right to outwardly manifest those beliefs--
which can be limited for certain, specific justifications.\1\ 
These principles are codified in various international 
instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR).\2\ China has signed \3\ and stated its intent 
to ratify \4\ the ICCPR, which obligates China to refrain in 
good faith from acts that would defeat the treaty's purpose.\5\
    Article 36 of China's Constitution guarantees citizens 
``freedom of religious belief'' and protection for ``normal 
religious activities.'' \6\ With essential terms such as 
``normal'' undefined, it is unclear whether China's 
Constitution protects the same range of belief and outward 
manifestation that is recognized under international law.\7\ In 
other ways, however, China's Constitution and other Chinese 
legal provisions \8\ join the ICCPR in prohibiting 
discrimination based on religion \9\ and loosely parallel the 
ICCPR's prohibition on coercion \10\ by forbidding state 
agencies, social organizations, and individuals from compelling 
citizens to believe or not believe in any religion.\11\
    China's Constitution prohibits ``making use of religion to 
engage in activities that disrupt social order, impair the 
health of citizens, or interfere with the educational system of 
the State.'' \12\ The ICCPR does allow State Parties to 
restrict outward manifestations of religion or belief, but such 
restrictions must be ``prescribed by law and . . . necessary to 
protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of others.'' \13\
                Religious Affairs Regulations and Policy
    Religious affairs in China are administered by a network of 
Party committees, government agencies, and official religious 
organizations under the direction of the Standing Committee of 
the Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau 
(Politburo).\14\ The United Front Work Department (UFWD), under 
the Party's Central Committee, develops and oversees 
implementation of Party policies on religion and monitors 
religious groups and leaders on behalf of the Party.\15\ The 
government agency responsible for religious affairs at the 
national level is the State Administration for Religious 
Affairs (SARA) under the State Council, while subnational 
bureaus manage religious affairs at lower levels.\16\ These 
religious affairs agencies have effective authority over the 
state-sanctioned ``patriotic'' religious associations that act 
as liaisons between the government and practitioners of the 
five ``main'' religions in China,\17\ while the UFWD vets the 
association leaders.\18\ Public security bureaus are generally 
responsible for enforcement of laws against religious activity 
deemed illegal.\19\ The ``610 Office'' is a working group, made 
up of officials from a number of Party and government agencies, 
that was originally established in 1999 to coordinate and 
execute operations for campaigns aimed at eliminating the 
practice of Falun Gong.\20\ In 2003, the ``610 Office'' was 
authorized to target other religions as well.\21\
    The Chinese government's regulatory framework for religious 
affairs imposes numerous restrictions on religious freedom. The 
2005 Regulations on Religious Affairs (RRA), in effect during 
this reporting period, protect ``lawful'' religious rights.\22\ 
``Lawful'' is not defined, and religious activity is subject to 
extensive government approvals and restrictions.\23\ These 
include official guidelines for the content and distribution of 
religious publications, restrictions that limit religious 
activities to government-approved sites, and requirements that 
religious personnel be approved by local religious affairs 
authorities.\24\
    Current regulations require religious groups to register 
with the government, and legal protection of religious 
activities is contingent on complying with registration 
requirements.\25\ Registration requirements can be burdensome 
and sometimes impossible for religious groups to fulfill--for 
example, smaller groups may not have the requisite 50 
individual members \26\ or the resources to complete complex 
financial reporting requirements.\27\ Officials will deny 
registration applications of religious groups that are not 
affiliated with a state-sanctioned patriotic association.\28\ 
This poses a challenge for the registration of religious groups 
that refuse to join patriotic associations; some groups prefer 
not to join due to their desire to maintain autonomy or their 
view that doing so would violate their religious beliefs.\29\ 
Registration and the regulatory system that it facilitates 
impose restrictions \30\ on rights to religious freedom or 
belief recognized under international law, such as the right to 
meet as a religious group,\31\ the right to determine religious 
leadership \32\ and content of worship,\33\ the right to 
religious education,\34\ the right to publication and 
dissemination of religious materials,\35\ and the right to 
international communication and exchange.\36\
    Unregistered groups and registered groups alike operate in 
an environment that is uncertain, as officials may tolerate or 
punish them depending on whether their activities align with 
government and Party interests. In practice, experts observe 
that officials may tolerate the religious activities of 
unregistered groups,\37\ especially if officials believe that 
the activities promote social or economic development 
interests.\38\ Unregistered religious and spiritual communities 
are vulnerable to government harassment, detention, and other 
abuses,\39\ yet groups may be sanctioned regardless of 
registration status when officials view them as posing a 
challenge to government authority or the Party's interests,\40\ 
with some religious groups and practices banned outright.\41\ 
The UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief has 
stated that ``registration as a precondition for practicing 
one's religion or belief'' is a limitation interfering with the 
right to freedom of religion or belief.\42\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Revisions to the Regulations on Religious Affairs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Chinese government released draft revisions to the Regulations on
 Religious Affairs in September 2016,\43\ soliciting public comment for
 a one-month period.\44\ In a written explanation, the government
 highlighted objectives that included addressing the use of religion to
 threaten national security, strengthening the role of patriotic
 religious organizations, regulating religious content on the Internet,
 allowing religious groups to register for legal status and obtain
 property rights over their assets, and combatting commercialization in
 the religious sector.\45\ Some Chinese religious believers and scholars
 viewed a few of the proposed changes as potential improvements on
 current regulations, particularly the provision allowing religious
 groups to register for legal status.\46\ The draft revisions also
 included new provisions codifying the role of public security in the
 implementation of religious affairs regulations \47\ and increased
 government scrutiny of religious groups,\48\ prompting observations
 that such measures would serve to increase government control of
 religious groups.\49\ The draft revisions also included new penalties
 for those ``providing facilities'' for unauthorized religious
 activities,\50\ which experts believed might be used to target
 unregistered Protestant groups.\51\ Observers also noted that the draft
 revisions failed to clearly define some important terms, such as
 ``extremism,'' ``normal,'' and ``abnormal,'' thus giving authorities
 broad discretion to restrict citizens' religious rights.\52\ One Muslim
 leader said that such discretion over the definition of ``extremism''
 in local regulations had already led to large-scale repression of
 religious freedom in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.\53\ The
 release of the draft revisions followed a major leadership conference
 on religious policy convened by President and Party General Secretary
 Xi Jinping in April 2016,\54\ during which Xi promoted the
 ``sinicization'' of religion in China, a term that officials have used
 often in recent years to encourage the adaptation of religious beliefs
 and activities to align with government and Party interests.\55\ One
 international rights organization characterized the revisions as
 ``implementing the new ideology [of sinicization] on a legislative
 level.'' \56\ The revisions are in line with a long-term Party policy
 of using religion as an instrument for promoting national unity and
 social stability,\57\ although commentators also drew parallels with
 recently implemented restrictions on civil society groups through
 legislative measures such as the PRC Law on the Management of Overseas
 Non-Governmental Organizations' Activities.\58\ In January 2017, the
 SARA included implementation of revisions to the RRA in its 2017 Work
 Objectives, stating that it would hold meetings and trainings regarding
 implementation and provide guidance to local governments to align local
 regulations with the revisions.\59\
  On September 7, 2017, the State Council issued revisions to the RRA,
 to take effect on February 1, 2018.\60\ The final revisions contained
 few changes from the draft released for public feedback.\61\ One
 scholar stated that he believed some of the ``candid'' recommendations
 offered by lawyers and legal scholars went unconsidered and that the
 final revisions were ``more restrictive'' than the draft version.\62\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Other laws and Party policies also continued to restrict 
citizens' freedom to hold religious beliefs and practice 
religion. Article 300 of the PRC Criminal Law criminalizes 
``organizing and using a cult to undermine implementation of 
the law.'' \63\ In January 2017, the Supreme People's Court and 
the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued a joint 
interpretation of Article 300 that set out new sentencing 
guidelines and expressly criminalized certain forms of Internet 
usage to disseminate information about a ``cult,'' among other 
revisions.\64\ One international rights organization speculated 
that the new sentencing guidelines might reduce the length of 
sentences under Article 300, yet also expressed concern about 
the authorization of new penalties, such as deprivation of 
political rights.\65\ The revised interpretation took effect in 
February 2017.\66\ In addition, the PRC National Security Law 
stipulates that ``the use of religion to conduct illegal 
criminal activities that threaten state security'' must be 
prevented and punished.\67\ The law also contains mandates to 
``maintain the order of normal religious activities,'' ``oppose 
the interference of foreign influence into domestic religious 
affairs,'' and ``suppress cult organizations.'' \68\ The long-
standing \69\ ban on religious belief for Party members 
remained in effect; SARA Director Wang Zuo'an reiterated the 
ban in a July 2017 article for a major Party journal,\70\ 
noting that in recent years, certain high level officials had 
been found to believe in religion and that officials with 
religious beliefs would ``undergo education to relinquish their 
beliefs'' or face punishment.\71\
               Chinese Buddhism (Non-Tibetan) and Taoism
    While government and Party officials rarely targeted 
Chinese Buddhist and Taoist communities with direct 
suppression, they nonetheless continued to subject these 
religions to extensive regulation and control. A large number 
of Chinese citizens engage in Buddhist and Taoist practices, 
with estimates of around 244 million Buddhists as of 2010,\72\ 
and 173 million citizens engaging in some Taoist practices as 
of 2007.\73\ [For information on Tibetan Buddhism, see Section 
V--Tibet.]
    Government regulations continued to require Taoist and 
Buddhist temples to register with their local religious affairs 
bureau,\74\ and to forbid unregistered sites from conducting 
religious activities and collecting donations.\75\ Despite this 
prohibition, numerous active Buddhist and Taoist sites have not 
registered.\76\
    The government and Party continued their wide-ranging 
control and support of officially sanctioned practice of 
Chinese Buddhism and Taoism. In addition to maintaining 
extensive regulations,\77\ authorities continued to exercise 
control over sanctioned practice by, for example, administering 
sanctioned sites in conjunction with religious leaders.\78\ 
Authorities ensure the political reliability of Taoist 
religious leadership by requiring all candidates for the clergy 
to obtain the approval of the local patriotic association and 
religious affairs bureau for ordination.\79\
    Chinese officials continued to hold the leader of the 
Buddhist Huazang Dharma group, Wu Zeheng,\80\ and several 
followers in custody. Authorities sentenced Wu to life in 
prison in 2015 on charges of ``organizing and using a cult to 
undermine implementation of the law,'' \81\ rape, fraud, and 
the production and sale of poisonous or harmful food.\82\ In 
November 2016, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
issued opinions concluding that the Chinese government 
arbitrarily detained Wu and his followers for ``legitimate 
exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
freedom of religion and freedom of association,'' opining that 
Wu and the other detainees should be released immediately and 
compensated for the violations of their rights.\83\ Wu served 
an 11-year sentence from 1999 to 2010 for ``economic crimes'' 
after openly criticizing official restrictions on religious 
freedom in China.\84\
                       Christianity--Catholicism
    The Chinese government maintained measures that impede the 
freedom under international standards \85\ of Chinese Catholic 
congregations to be led by clergy who are selected and who 
conduct their ministry according to Catholic religious beliefs. 
The number of Catholics is estimated to be around 12 million, 
with the State Administration for Religious Affairs reporting 
that 5.7 million Catholics were part of officially sanctioned 
congregations in 2014.\86\ The government continued to push for 
Chinese Catholic bishops to be ``self-selected and self-
ordained'' \87\--selected through the patriotic religious 
organizations in consultation with government and Party 
officials, and then ordained by Chinese bishops without the 
involvement of the Holy See.\88\ Many Chinese Catholics, 
sometimes known as ``underground Catholics,'' avoid the 
ministry of these bishops because they believe legitimate 
ecclesiastical authority can be conferred only by the Pope's 
mandate.\89\ Many Chinese Catholics also object to bishops who 
are members of the patriotic religious association for Chinese 
Catholics, the Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA).\90\ The 
Holy See has declared the CPA ``incompatible with Catholic 
doctrine'' because it claims authority over Chinese bishops and 
their church communities while being backed by the Chinese 
government and maintaining independence from the Holy See.\91\
    The Chinese government and the Holy See were reportedly 
close to an agreement about the system of bishop appointments 
in China in October 2016,\92\ but the potential agreement was 
in question after Paul Lei Shiyin, an excommunicated bishop 
ordained without papal approval, participated in two ordination 
ceremonies for Chinese bishops later in the year.\93\ Local 
observers reportedly believed that Lei's inclusion in the 
ordinations was directed by the Chinese government to signal 
its ultimate authority over the Catholic Church in China.\94\ A 
Catholic news media outlet reported that a round of talks in 
June 2017 ``was not smooth,'' ending with ``no open gesture 
from either side.'' \95\
    Government officials continued to detain or otherwise 
restrict the freedom of Catholic leaders in both the 
underground and official church. In April 2017, officials 
reportedly detained two underground Catholic bishops in 
undisclosed locations--Peter Shao Zhumin of the Diocese of 
Wenzhou in Zhejiang province \96\ and Vincent Guo Xijin of the 
Diocese of Mindong in Fujian province.\97\ The bishops were 
unable to preside over Easter services, and Catholic news media 
reported that the local governments intended to pressure the 
bishops into joining the CPA.\98\ Guo was reportedly released 
in May 2017; Shao was released after five days in detention, 
but detained again in May 2017.\99\ According to the Catholic 
news outlet LaCroix, this was the fourth time authorities had 
detained Shao since he became the Bishop of Wenzhou after his 
predecessor passed away in September 2016.\100\ As of August 
2017, the Commission had not observed any reports as to the 
whereabouts or condition of Shao or of several underground 
Catholic leaders from Hebei province, including Coadjutor 
Bishop Cui Tai, Bishop Cosmos Shi Enxiang, and Bishop James Su 
Zhimin.\101\ A bishop in the official church, Thaddeus Ma Daqin 
of the Diocese of Shanghai, remained under surveillance and 
extralegal confinement at Sheshan seminary in Shanghai 
municipality, although he reportedly rejoined the Shanghai 
branch of the CPA by January 2017.\102\ Authorities had 
restricted Ma's freedom of movement and communication after his 
public resignation from the CPA during his ordination ceremony 
in July 2012.\103\
                      Christianity--Protestantism
    Chinese government and Communist Party officials continued 
to subject Protestant Christian belief and practice to a wide 
range of restrictions, infringing upon the religious freedom of 
an estimated 60 to 80 million Chinese Protestants.\104\
    Instances of official persecution of Protestant communities 
in 2016 reportedly increased from the prior year.\105\ 
International rights organization ChinaAid said that the 
intensified clampdown of recent years may be due in part to 
official concern that Protestant communities pose a potential 
threat to the dominance of the Communist Party because of their 
size, socioeconomic diversity, independent and decentralized 
manner of organization, and connections with Christian groups 
based in foreign, democratic countries.\106\ International 
observers asserted that official hostility toward Protestantism 
may also be connected to the Party's ``sinicization'' campaign 
in recent years aimed at adapting religious belief and 
practices in China to align with government and Party 
interests.\107\
    Officials increased restrictions and monitoring for 
churches that have joined the Three-Self Patriotic Movement 
(TSPM), the state-controlled organization that manages 
Protestant religious practice.\108\ These increased 
restrictions, commentators noted, continued a trend of 
expanding the enforcement of repressive policies from house 
churches to officially sanctioned churches.\109\ Such measures 
included a prohibition on churches organizing summer activities 
for youth in Henan province \110\ and a ban on minors 
participating in any church activities for many churches in 
Wenzhou municipality, Zhejiang province.\111\ Earlier in the 
year, the Zhejiang TSPM reportedly issued a written requirement 
for all churches, including Catholic churches, to install 
surveillance cameras for the purported purpose of 
``strengthening anti-terrorism efforts.'' \112\ Local officials 
began the forcible installation of cameras in some churches in 
March 2017 and reportedly beat those who attempted to oppose 
their efforts.\113\
    Chinese officials continued policies aimed at pressuring 
unregistered Protestant congregations, commonly known as house 
churches, to join the TSPM.\114\ As in previous years,\115\ 
Protestant house churches continued to face raids during church 
gatherings,\116\ eviction from meeting spaces,\117\ and 
official bans on worship.\118\ ChinaAid further reported that 
authorities forced some churches in Wenzhou to install 
surveillance cameras for government monitoring, in apparent 
connection with the TSPM notice mentioned above.\119\ 
Authorities also reportedly subjected some believers to 
harassment,\120\ violence,\121\ or detention.\122\ In Jiangxi 
province, local governments reportedly issued directives to 
forcibly remove crosses and perimeter walls from churches; 
\123\ by August 2017, authorities had removed at least 10 
church crosses,\124\ leading local religious leaders to raise 
concerns about parallels to the official cross-removal campaign 
in Zhejiang beginning in 2014 that ultimately removed more than 
2,000 crosses.\125\ The Wenzhou Municipality Ethnic and 
Religious Affairs Bureau in Zhejiang announced a new plan for a 
program that would deploy over 1,500 religious affairs bureau 
liaisons to monitor the religious activity of all households in 
Lucheng district, Wenzhou.\126\ In several instances, 
authorities detained house church members on charges of 
``organizing and using a cult to undermine implementation of 
the law,'' under Article 300 of the PRC Criminal Law.\127\ Some 
researchers have noted with concern that some Chinese 
authorities may be applying the criminal ``cult'' designation 
to religious groups beyond those officially banned by the 
government to generally cover all religious organizations not 
officially registered with the government.\128\ Chinese 
Protestant communities expressed concern that the revisions to 
the Regulations on Religious Affairs \129\ would provide a 
legal basis for further restricting the activities of 
unregistered Protestant congregations.\130\
    During this reporting year, prominent cases involving the 
detention of Protestant Christian believers included:
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Li Hongmin. Authorities arrested Li Hongmin, a 
        member of a house church in Guangdong province, in July 
        2016 and tried him for ``illegal business activity'' 
        \131\ in October 2016.\132\ The indictment accused him 
        of printing Christian books without official 
        permission.\133\ In March 2017, authorities sentenced 
        him to 10 months' imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 
        yuan.\134\ Local authorities harassed his wife, Xu Lei, 
        and pressured her landlord to evict her after she 
        attempted to petition authorities in Beijing 
        municipality regarding Li's detention.\135\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Living Stone Church members. Authorities tried 
        several members of the Living Stone Church, a house 
        church in Guiyang municipality, Guizhou province, after 
        extended periods of detention, including Pastor Li 
        Guozhi (also known as Yang Hua, sentenced to two years 
        and six months' imprisonment in December 2016 for 
        ``intentionally leaking state secrets''),\136\ Zhang 
        Xiuhong (a church deacon, sentenced to five years' 
        imprisonment in February 2017 for ``illegal business 
        activity,'' \137\ later reduced in August 2017 to a 
        three-year sentence, suspended for five years),\138\ 
        and church members Wang Yao and Yu Lei (tried in 
        October 2016 for ``intentionally leaking state 
        secrets,'' both had yet to receive a ruling as of 
        August 2017).\139\ In March 2017, Pastor Yang Hua's 
        lawyers asserted that he urgently needed to be 
        hospitalized for a serious medical condition and asked 
        the procuratorate to review the necessity of his 
        detention.\140\ The Guiyang government subjected many 
        other Living Stone Church members to repressive 
        measures such as fines, harassment, surveillance, and 
        detention after designating the church an ``illegal 
        social group'' in 2015.\141\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Zhang Shaojie. The pastor of a registered TSPM 
        church in Nanle county, Puyang municipality, Henan 
        province, Zhang Shaojie continued to serve a 12-year 
        sentence issued in 2014 for ``fraud'' and ``gathering a 
        crowd to disturb social order.'' \142\ In June 2017, 
        his daughter reported that authorities were depriving 
        him of sleep, food, and access to the outdoors, and 
        also forbid him from discussing conditions in prison 
        with family members during visits.\143\ Authorities 
        detained Zhang in November 2013, after a group of 
        church members traveled to Beijing municipality to file 
        a petition regarding a land dispute with local 
        authorities.\144\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Gu Yuese. Authorities in Hangzhou 
        municipality, Zhejiang province, detained Gu Yuese for 
        a second time in December 2016 and re-arrested him in 
        January 2017 for ``misappropriation of funds.'' \145\ 
        Gu is reportedly the highest level figure within a 
        government-sponsored religious organization to have 
        been arrested in nearly thirty years--he was the leader 
        of China's largest officially sanctioned church \146\ 
        and chairperson of the China Christian Council, a 
        patriotic religious organization, at the provincial 
        level.\147\ He was detained in January 2016 and 
        stripped of these positions in February 2016 after he 
        expressed opposition to the ongoing cross-removal 
        campaign in Zhejiang.\148\ Authorities had arrested Gu 
        on the same charge in January 2016 and released him on 
        bail in March 2016.\149\
                               Falun Gong
    As in previous years, authorities continued to detain Falun 
Gong practitioners and subject them to harsh treatment.\150\ 
Due to extreme government suppression, it is difficult to 
determine the number of Falun Gong practitioners in China.\151\ 
Officials have reportedly subjected practitioners to extreme 
physical and psychological coercion, with human rights 
organizations \152\ and Falun Gong practitioners documenting 
coercive and violent practices against practitioners during 
custody, including physical violence,\153\ forced drug 
administration,\154\ and other forms of torture.\155\ In March 
2017, Minghui (Clear Wisdom), a U.S.-based news organization 
affiliated with Falun Gong, reported 80 confirmed deaths of 
Falun Gong practitioners in 2016 due to treatment while in 
custody.\156\ Authorities commonly prosecute Falun Gong 
practitioners under Article 300 of the PRC Criminal Law.\157\
    International observers continued to express concern over 
reports that numerous organ transplants in China have used the 
organs of detained prisoners, including Falun Gong 
practitioners.\158\ International medical professionals were 
skeptical \159\ of a Chinese health official's claims that 
organ procurement systems have been reformed in compliance with 
international standards, noting a lack of transparency \160\ 
and discrepancies in official data.\161\
                                 Islam
    During this reporting year, officials maintained policies 
exerting strong influence and control over the religious belief 
and activities of an estimated 10.5 million \162\ Hui Muslim 
believers. Although policies for Hui Muslims remained less 
repressive than those affecting Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region (XUAR),\163\ hostile rhetoric targeting 
Muslims in general from both officials and the public \164\ 
increased.\165\ One expert said that this could increase the 
likelihood that policies affecting the religious freedom of Hui 
Muslims may become more restrictive.\166\ [For information on 
freedom of religion for Uyghur and other minority group Muslim 
believers in the XUAR, see Section IV--Xinjiang.]
    Ongoing policies included ``political reliability'' and 
``patriotic education'' requirements for religious leaders. To 
be officially certified, imams must be educated at state-
sanctioned Islamic schools and be approved by the local 
religious affairs bureau and the Islamic Association of China, 
the patriotic religious association for Chinese Muslims.\167\ 
After certification, imams must continue to attend political 
training sessions.\168\ Both the Islamic Association of China 
(IAC) and the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA) 
continued to promote interpretations of Islamic law and belief 
that support the Chinese political system.\169\ All Chinese 
Muslims seeking to carry out the Hajj pilgrimage must fulfill 
requirements for ``political reliability,'' including taking 
``patriotic education'' classes, obtaining approval from their 
local religious affairs bureau, and participating only through 
tours arranged by the IAC.\170\
    This past year, officials made a number of statements 
claiming a need to counter an alleged increase of Muslim 
extremist influence in Chinese society, while reportedly 
tacitly approving anti-Muslim commentary and the harassment of 
Muslim believers on social media networks. SARA Director Wang 
Zuo'an stated in November 2016 that Islamic extremism was 
spreading to China's ``inland provincial areas,'' and that 
authorities should respect Islamic beliefs, but that religious 
influence on political, legal, or educational affairs would not 
be tolerated.\171\ A U.S.-based scholar stated that ``interest 
groups'' had used the recently permissive environment for 
``Islamophobia'' online to justify security measures taken 
against Uyghur communities in the XUAR.\172\ Observers also 
noted a connection with the recent ascendance of Party 
officials who support hard-line policies on religion.\173\ In 
one example from December 2016, a propaganda official in the 
XUAR used inflammatory language in an online post regarding the 
rebuilding of a historic mosque in Hefei municipality, Anhui 
province, by the local Hui Muslim community; locals 
subsequently held demonstrations against the mosque and 
threatened local Hui Muslim believers.\174\ Domestic online 
commentators have also criticized the Chinese government's 
restrictions on Hui Muslim believers for being too lax relative 
to restrictions on Muslims in the XUAR.\175\ One expert stated 
that the anti-Muslim anxiety generated on social media could 
put pressure on local officials to respond with policy 
measures,\176\ making Hui Muslim communities vulnerable to 
increased surveillance and restrictions.\177\
                      Other Religious Communities
    Religious communities outside of the five religions that 
are the main objects of religious affairs regulation \178\ 
continue to exist in China; some enjoy official support, while 
others face suppression from authorities. For example, despite 
lacking formal recognition at the national level, some folk 
religious sites \179\ and Eastern Orthodox Christian 
communities \180\ are recognized at the local level. In 
contrast, authorities maintained the restrictions imposed 
suddenly in 2014 on Jewish religious activity in Kaifeng 
municipality, Henan province.\181\ The Chinese government also 
maintained its official policy of allowing some foreign 
religious communities to hold religious services for foreign 
nationals.\182\

Buddhist Association of China, the China Islamic Association, the China

National Conference of Bishops (an organization led by Catholic 
clergy), the Three-Self (for ``self-governing, self-supporting, and

Council (the latter two organizations have overlapping membership and 
represent Protestants). According to Goossaert and Palmer, although 
``nominally independent,'' the ``patriotic'' religious associations are 
effectively under the authority of the State Council's agency for 
religious affairs.

State Council, Regulations on the Registration and Management of Social 
Organizations [Shehui tuanti dengji guanli tiaoli], issued 25 October 
98, amended and effective 6 February 16, art. 35. Article 6 of the 
Regulations on Religious Affairs require religious organizations to 
register in accordance with the Regulations on the Registration and 
Management of Social Organizations, and protects the religious 
activities of only those religious organizations in compliance with the 
latter regulations. The religious activities of all other religious 
organizations receive no such explicit protection under the Regulations 
and as such may be deemed illegal, resulting in a restriction of 
certain religious activities. See also ChinaAid, ``Church Torn Apart by 
Abuse Pens Letter Describing Persecution,'' 13 June 17.

effective 6 February 16, art. 35. While the Declaration includes the 
freedom to ``worship or assemble in connection with a religion or 
belief, and to establish and maintain places for these purposes,'' 
Article 6 of the Regulations on Religious Affairs requires religious 
organizations to register in accordance with the Regulations on the 
Registration and Management of Social Organizations. The latter in turn 
prohibit activities conducted by unregistered social organizations 
(art. 35), thus restricting the right of unregistered religious groups 
to assemble and worship, as well as establish and maintain places for 
those purposes.
    \32\ Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and 
of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, adopted by UN General

Regulations on Religious Affairs [Zongjiao shiwu tiaoli], issued 30 
November 04, effective 1 March 05, art. 27. While the Declaration 
includes the freedom to ``train, appoint, elect or designate by 
succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and 
standards of any religion or belief,'' the Regulations on Religious 
Affairs permit only those religious personnel approved by the relevant 
religious associations, referred to as ``religious organizations'' 
(zongjiao tuanti), to conduct religious activities (art. 27). China

Council, Regulations on Religious Affairs [Zongjiao shiwu tiaoli], 
issued 30 November 04, effective 1 March 05, art. 12. While the 
Declaration includes the freedoms to ``make, acquire, and use to an 
adequate extent the necessary articles and materials related to the 
rites or customs of a religion or belief'' (art. 6(c)), and to 
``celebrate holidays and ceremonies in accordance with the precepts of 
one's religion or belief'' (art. 6(h)), the Regulations on Religious 
Affairs have provisions such as requiring group religious activities to 
be held at registered sites with ``qualified'' religious personnel and 
in ``compliance with religious doctrines and canons'' (art. 12).
    \34\ Ibid., arts. 5(2), 6(e); Ibid., arts. 3, 8, 9, 43. While the 
Declaration includes the freedom of every child to ``have access to 
education in the matter of religion or belief in accordance with the 
wishes of his parents'' (art. 5(2)), and the freedom to ``teach a 
religion or belief in places suitable for these purposes'' (art. 6(e)), 
the Regulations on Religious Affairs prohibit use of religion to 
``interfere with the educational system of the State'' (art. 3) and 
require institutions for religious education to be approved at the 
national level (art. 8).
    \35\ Ibid., art. 6(d); Ibid., art. 7. While the Declaration 
includes the freedom to ``write, issue and disseminate relevant

regulate the contents of religious publications and require compliance 
with other administrative rules (art. 7).
    \36\ Ibid., art. 6(i); Ibid., arts. 10, 11, 22, 43. While the 
Declaration includes the freedom to ``establish and maintain 
communications with individuals and communities in matters of religion 
and belief at the national and international levels'' (art. 6(i)), the 
Regulations on Religious Affairs require separate approval for large-
scale religious activity that involves those governed by different 
provincial-level administrations (art. 22) and further require the hajj 
pilgrimage and religious studies abroad to be arranged by the state-
sanctioned national religious organizations (arts. 10-11).

                         Ethnic Minority Rights
                              Introduction
    During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, Chinese 
government and Communist Party officials continued to act in 
contravention of domestic and international law with regard to 
members of China's 55 recognized minority ``nationalities.'' 
\1\ The PRC Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law contains protections 
for the languages, religious beliefs, and customs of these 
``nationalities,'' in addition to a system of regional autonomy 
in designated areas.\2\ Article 27 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed 
and declared an intention to ratify, contains safeguards for 
the rights of ``ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities'' 
within a state.\3\ In practice, however, Chinese authorities 
reportedly implemented policies that marginalized the cultures 
and languages of ethnic minority populations.\4\ [See Section 
IV--Xinjiang and Section V--Tibet for additional information on 
these areas.]
                         State Minority Policy
    According to the 2016-2020 National Human Rights Action 
Plan issued by the State Council, Chinese authorities will 
``prioritize'' rights for ethnic minorities including ``[t]heir 
ability to participate in the deliberation and administration 
of state affairs,'' their right to economic development, and 
their right ``to learn, use and develop their own spoken and 
written languages.'' \5\ Nevertheless, during this reporting 
year, officials continued to promote top-down development 
initiatives that restricted ethnic minorities' ability to 
preserve and practice their cultures and languages.\6\ The UN 
Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip 
Alston, following his 2016 visit to China, issued a report 
criticizing what he saw as authorities' lack of consultation 
with ethnic minorities regarding economic development that 
affects them, and he recommended that the State Ethnic Affairs 
Commission develop policies integrating human rights 
considerations into all aspects of its policymaking.\7\ He 
noted that ``most ethnic minorities in China are exposed to 
serious human rights challenges, including significantly higher 
poverty rates, ethnic discrimination and forced relocation.'' 
\8\
                LIMITS ON MONGOLIAN-LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION
    Mongol parents and students in the Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region (IMAR) reportedly faced limits on access to 
Mongolian-language instruction during the past reporting year, 
in spite of Chinese law protecting the use of minority 
languages.\9\ In late 2016, Mongol parents in Chifeng 
municipality, IMAR, published open letters on social media \10\ 
and demonstrated outside government offices to protest the 
appointment of Han Chinese principals to the only two 
kindergartens in Chifeng that provide instruction in the 
Mongolian language.\11\ The administrations of the two schools 
reportedly restricted the use of the Mongolian language, and at 
least one of the schools banned Mongol teachers from speaking 
Mongolian in the office.\12\ In April 2017, four rights 
advocates, representing 429 Mongol teachers who had taught in 
the Mongolian language in Horchin (Ke'erqin) Right Forward 
Banner, Hinggan (Xing'an) League, IMAR, petitioned regional 
government authorities in Hohhot municipality, IMAR, over 
authorities' dismissal of the teachers from their jobs 
beginning in the year 2000, which they said authorities did 
without providing justification.\13\
                 Grasslands Protests in Inner Mongolia
    During this reporting year, Mongol herders in the IMAR 
demonstrated over the state's role in the loss of their 
traditional grazing lands, the harmful ecological effect of 
state development on grassland and livestock,\14\ and the 
state's failure to provide herders with adequate compensation 
for their land.\15\ As in past reporting years,\16\ authorities 
detained many of the Mongol herders who peacefully protested, 
including those who voiced their concerns online or talked with 
foreign reporters about their complaints.\17\
    Representative examples of protests by Mongol herders and 
villagers included the following:
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; On October 17, 2016, in Hailas (Hailasu) 
        township, Ongniud (Wengniute) Banner, Chifeng, nearly 
        200 herders marched toward the construction site of a 
        state-run pig farm and blocked the road, in protest 
        against what they alleged was the farm's occupation of 
        their traditional grazing lands.\18\ Local officials 
        reportedly sent more than 400 police officers to deal 
        with the protest; the police beat many herders and 
        detained at least three.\19\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; On November 2, 2016, dozens of herders in 
        Zaruud (Zalute) Banner, Tongliao municipality, IMAR, 
        protested in front of banner government offices over an 
        aluminum plant's pollution of a local river, which the 
        herders said had poisoned their sheep.\20\ Security 
        personnel reportedly detained nine of the herders, and 
        prevented others from attending the protest.\21\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; On April 10, 2017, over 300 herders in Horchin 
        (Ke'erqin) Left Rear Banner, Tongliao, gathered in an 
        attempt to block bulldozers and tractors from turning 
        up earth on their grazing lands for a government 
        afforestation project.\22\ On April 13, security 
        personnel reportedly took 13 of the herders into 
        custody, placing them under administrative detention 
        for 10 days.\23\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; On April 10, 2017, in Horchin (Ke'erqin) Right 
        Forward Banner, Hinggan (Xing'an) League, IMAR, over 
        3,000 Mongols protested in the streets and in front of 
        a local government building, demanding compensation for 
        Mongols whose traditional land had reportedly been 
        taken or ruined due to state initiatives and 
        policies.\24\ Protesters clashed with nearly 1,000 
        security personnel, who reportedly detained at least 30 
        people and beat many protesters, some severely.\25\
    In addition, in early August 2017, in Evenk Autonomous 
Banner, Hulunbei'er municipality, IMAR, more than 100 ethnic 
Evenki herders reportedly protested over restrictions on 
livestock grazing on local grasslands.\26\ Police reportedly 
beat and injured many of the herders.\27\
    Beginning on May 10, authorities in Xilingol (Xilinguole) 
League, IMAR, reportedly administratively detained Mongol 
Yangjindolma for 15 days for ``inciting and planning an illegal 
gathering.'' \28\ She told Radio Free Asia (RFA) that she had 
planned an activity to call for the designation of a ``Protect 
the Grasslands Day,'' and to commemorate the sixth anniversary 
of the death of Mongol herder Mergen, who was run over by a 
coal truck in 2011 while protesting against a mining company's 
destruction of grasslands.\29\ On June 20, Yangjindolma 
submitted a petition in Hohhot municipality, IMAR, the regional 
capital, to protest against her alleged detention and 
torture.\30\ She told RFA that authorities had shackled her to 
a ``tiger bench'' for 24 hours while interrogating her.\31\
            Hada Continues To Protest Official Mistreatment
    Mongol rights advocate Hada reportedly continued to press 
authorities to hold officials accountable for mistreating him 
during his 15-year prison sentence and subsequent detention and 
surveillance.\32\ IMAR authorities imprisoned Hada for 15 years 
starting in 1995 and then extralegally detained him for another 
4 years,\33\ following his organization of peaceful 
demonstrations for Mongol rights and his establishment of the 
banned Southern Mongolian Democratic Alliance.\34\ In a 
November 2016 interview, he described his current living 
conditions, in an apartment heavily surveilled by security 
personnel, as similar to those he experienced under detention, 
and complained that authorities had at times cut off his 
family's water and heat in an effort to compel him to 
``cooperate with them and give up [his] ideas.'' \35\ In the 
same interview, his wife Xinna said Chinese officials were 
determined to force Hada to ``admit to his crimes.'' \36\ In a 
separate development, in May 2017, authorities in Hohhot 
reportedly forcibly demolished a building that Xinna used to 
store books and other items without her consent.\37\ In the 
summer of 2017, authorities reportedly restricted her Internet 
access.\38\
    In an example of government restrictions on Mongols' 
freedom of speech, in October 2016, authorities shut down the 
Genghis Khan website, after numerous tributes to recently 
deceased Mongol rights advocate and author Govruud Huuchinhuu 
appeared on the site.\39\ Authorities had for years persecuted 
Huuchinhuu in part due to her advocacy on behalf of Hada.\40\

    International Standards and China's Coercive Population Policies
    During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, Chinese 
authorities continued to actively promote and implement 
coercive population control policies that violate international 
standards. 2016 marked the first full year that the Chinese 
Communist Party and central government authorities implemented 
the ``universal two-child policy'' that allows all married 
couples to have two children.\1\ Authorities continued to place 
an emphasis on birth limits and adherence to family planning as 
a ``basic national policy.'' \2\ The amended PRC Population and 
Family Planning Law and provincial-level regulations limit 
couples' freedom to build their families as they see fit, and 
include provisions that require couples be married to have 
children and limit them to bearing two children.\3\ Exceptions 
allowing for additional children exist for couples who meet 
certain criteria, which vary by province, including some 
exceptions for ethnic minorities,\4\ remarried couples, and 
couples who have children with disabilities.\5\ Officials 
reportedly continued to enforce compliance with population 
planning targets using methods including heavy fines,\6\ 
detention,\7\ forced sterilization,\8\ and abortion.\9\
    Coercive controls imposed on Chinese women and their 
families, and additional abuses engendered by China's 
population and family planning system, violate standards set 
forth in the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 
and the 1994 Programme of Action of the Cairo International 
Conference on Population and Development.\10\ China was a state 
participant in the negotiation and adoption of both.\11\ Acts 
of official coercion committed in the implementation of 
population control policies contravene provisions of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention),\12\ which China 
has ratified.\13\ In November 2015, the UN Committee against 
Torture conducted its most recent periodic review of China's 
compliance with the Convention.\14\ In its concluding 
observations, the Committee stated its concerns about China's 
``use of coercive measures for the implementation of the 
population policy,'' and ``reports of coerced sterilization and 
forced abortions, [and] the lack of information on the number 
of investigations into such allegations.'' \15\
            Implementation of the Universal Two-Child Policy
    Amid demographic and economic concerns voiced by population 
experts and research institutions,\16\ central Party 
authorities issued a decision at the Fifth Plenum of the 18th 
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in October 
2015 to adopt a ``universal two-child policy'' (quanmian 
erhai), thereby allowing all married couples to have two 
children.\17\ On December 27, 2015, the National People's 
Congress Standing Committee amended the PRC Population and 
Family Planning Law, which became effective on January 1, 
2016.\18\ As of August 2017, 30 provincial-level jurisdictions 
had revised their population and family planning regulations in 
accordance with the amended national law.\19\ Despite these 
policy and legislative revisions, central government officials 
emphasized that family planning policy will remain a ``basic 
national policy'' (jiben guoce) \20\ and stressed the need to 
``maintain and strengthen'' the family planning apparatus at 
the grassroots level.\21\ Human rights advocates, demographic 
experts, and others expressed concerns that the coercive 
implementation of family planning measures and human rights 
abuses will persist despite the adoption of the universal two-
child policy.\22\
    Chinese government statistics showed that the universal 
two-child policy had limited to moderate impact during its 
first year of implementation in 2016. During the Commission's 
previous reporting year, the National Health and Family 
Planning Commission (NHFPC) had predicted that the universal 
two-child policy would result in population growth,\23\ with an 
additional 3 million children born per year \24\ and an 
estimated total of 17.5 to 21 million children born per year 
during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020).\25\ 
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics 
of China (NBS) in January 2017, the number of total births in 
2016 was 17.86 million, 1.31 million more births than the 2015 
NBS figure of 16.55 million.\26\ The NHFPC employed a different 
methodology; its data showed that the number of total births in 
2016 was 18.46 million, or approximately 1.91 million more 
births than the 2015 NBS figure.\27\ Although both the NBS and 
NHFPC figures were lower than the predicted annual growth of 3 
million additional births, NHFPC officials stated that the 
growth had met official expectations \28\ and that the 
universal two-child policy was effective,\29\ and predicted 
that the growth would continue.\30\ The numbers of total births 
in 2016 as reported by NBS and NHFPC--of which approximately 45 
percent were second children--were the highest since 2000.\31\
    Some government reports and observers differed from the 
NHFPC over the impact of the universal two-child policy, 
suggesting that the growth in the number of births in 2016 
might be a short-term phenomenon.\32\ Some married couples were 
reportedly waiting for the government policy to change in 2016 
in order to avoid fines associated with having a second child, 
while others were waiting to have a child in the Year of the 
Monkey, a more auspicious year for having children according to 
the traditional lunar calendar.\33\ Reports suggested that the 
impact of the universal two-child policy may be limited in the 
long term, as the fertility rate is likely to remain low.\34\ 
Other population experts, such as Yi Fuxian and Huang Wenzheng, 
expressed reservations about the official birth data, 
estimating a lower number of total births in 2016 in the range 
of 12 million to 13 million.\35\ Some experts also noted that 
the universal two-child policy does not adequately address the 
issue of low fertility rate and the high costs associated with 
controlling fertility, and urged the Chinese government to end 
all birth restrictions.\36\
    Many married couples were reportedly reluctant to have a 
second child due to a number of factors, including the high 
cost of rearing an additional child,\37\ lack of adequate child 
care and education options,\38\ lack of energy to look after 
children,\39\ disruption to career development,\40\ and the 
perception that having one child is enough due to decades-long 
government propaganda.\41\ Central government authorities 
pledged to implement ``supporting policy measures'' to address 
these concerns, including efforts to enhance public services 
for women and children's health care,\42\ child care, and 
education,\43\ in order to ``promote long-term and balanced 
population development.'' \44\ During this reporting year, 
government authorities continued to implement the birth 
registration system and promoted registration of children 
online, allowing married couples to register their first two 
children without going through complicated approval or 
application processes \45\ that were common prior to the 2016 
amendment to the PRC Population and Family Planning Law.\46\
                        Coercive Implementation
    Abuses committed during the implementation of family 
planning policies continued during the Commission's 2017 
reporting year. The amended PRC Population and Family Planning 
Law contains provisions that prohibit officials from infringing 
upon the ``legitimate rights and interests'' of citizens while 
implementing family planning policies.\47\ Some provincial-
level population planning regulations and local family planning 
agencies, however, continued to explicitly instruct officials 
to carry out abortions, often referred to as ``remedial 
measures'' (bujiu cuoshi), for ``out-of-plan'' pregnancies.\48\
                           OFFICIAL CAMPAIGNS
    Language used in official speeches and government reports 
from jurisdictions across China continued to reflect an 
emphasis on the harsh enforcement of family planning measures. 
During this reporting year, as in previous years,\49\ official 
reports from several provinces across China--including 
Hainan,\50\ Henan,\51\ Hubei,\52\ Hunan,\53\ and Jiangxi \54\--
continued to promote ``family planning work'' that entailed 
harsh and invasive family planning measures. Phrases such as 
``fight the family planning battle'' (da hao jisheng fanshen 
zhan),\55\ ``resolutely implement'' (hen zhua),\56\ and ``spare 
no efforts'' (quanli yifu) \57\ continued to appear in official 
speeches and government reports, indicating sustained efforts 
to promote these family planning campaigns.\58\
    Some local government authorities stated in official 
reports that the goal of ``family planning work'' is to 
``maintain a low birth level'' (wending di shengyu 
shuiping),\59\ while others emphasized the need to strictly 
control and punish ``illegal reproductive behaviors'' \60\ and 
implement ``remedial measures'' to address ``illegal 
pregnancies.'' \61\ Authorities imposed implementation 
targets,\62\ demanded family planning officials carry out the 
invasive ``three inspections'' (intrauterine device (IUD), 
pregnancy, and health inspections) \63\ and ``four procedures'' 
(IUD insertion, first-trimester abortion, mid- to late-term 
abortion, and sterilization),\64\ and demanded the collection 
of ``social compensation fees'' (shehui fuyang fei).\65\ In one 
example, a government report from Shaoyang municipality, Hunan, 
indicated that municipal authorities carried out 2,320 ``birth-
control'' operations in 2016--1,790 IUD insertions, 430 IUD 
removals, 10 sterilizations, and 90 abortions.\66\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Case of Forced Sterilization in Yunnan Province
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  According to state-funded news media Sixth Tone and Party-run media
 Beijing News, in February 2017, government officials in Luokan
 township, Zhenxiong county, Zhaotong municipality, Yunnan province,
 detained Hu Zhenggao and later beat him and forced him to undergo a
 vasectomy.\67\ The alleged incident occurred when Hu, currently a
 registered resident of Sichuan province, returned to his hometown in
 Yunnan for the lunar New Year holiday.\68\ Local authorities accused
 Hu, a father of four, of violating the family planning policy \69\ and
 demanded that he either pay 20,000 yuan (approximately US$2,900) or
 undergo a vasectomy.\70\ Hu had three children with his ex-wife--who
 underwent sterilization afterward--and had paid a fine in 2000 for
 violating the family planning policy.\71\ In 2015, Hu had another child
 with his current wife in Sichuan, and Sichuan authorities reportedly
 approved the birth.\72\ Zhenxiong authorities denied that Hu had been
 threatened or maltreated, insisting that Hu had ``volunteered to
 undergo the vasectomy,'' \73\ and that enforcement action was
 lawful.\74\
  According to Sixth Tone, village-level leaders in Zhenxiong confirmed
 that such operations are commonplace, as the county government imposes
 annual quotas on village officials to carry out sterilizations.\75\ One
 village was punished by cuts in government funding and public sector
 jobs after it had failed to meet its sterilization target.\76\
 Following the news reports, the Yunnan Province Health and Family
 Planning Commission directed local authorities to investigate the
 incident.\77\ According to a March 2017 Beijing Youth Daily report, the
 Zhenxiong County Party Standing Committee ordered the county's Party
 Discipline Inspection Commission to ``admonish'' Luokan township
 leaders and urged them to hold relevant family planning personnel
 accountable.\78\ Futhermore, the Yunnan Province Health and Family
 Planning Commission issued a circular forbidding local governments from
 carrying out forcible family planning operations.\79\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      PUNISHMENT FOR NONCOMPLIANCE
    Chinese authorities continued to use various methods of 
punishment to enforce citizens' compliance with population 
planning policies. In accordance with national-level legal 
provisions,\80\ local governments have directed officials to 
punish noncompliance through heavy fines, termed ``social 
compensation fees,'' which reportedly compel couples to choose 
between undergoing an unwanted abortion and incurring a fine 
much greater than the average annual income in their 
locality.\81\ On November 10, 2016, official Chinese news media 
Taihai Net reported a case in which local authorities in Wuping 
county, Longyan municipality, Fujian province, launched a 
``special action group'' to forcibly collect ``social 
compensation fees'' from violators who had children in excess 
of birth quotas.\82\ During an enforcement campaign, Wuping 
authorities detained two individuals surnamed Cheng and Lan who 
had refused to pay the fines.\83\ The report also warned that 
the authorities would continue to forcibly collect ``social 
compensation fees'' within their jurisdiction and ``to punish 
and educate'' violators, in order to ``effectively curb illegal 
births.'' \84\
    This past year, domestic news media reported an increase in 
the number of administrative lawsuits Chinese citizens filed 
against family planning agencies for the collection of ``social 
compensation fees.'' \85\ These cases were related to married 
couples who gave birth to a second child in violation of 
previous family planning policies and birth limits.\86\ Some 
observers called on government authorities to rescind these 
imposed fines; \87\ during the annual parliamentary meetings in 
March, several National People's Congress delegates and members 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also 
urged the government to abolish the ``social compensation fees 
system.'' \88\ The State Council issued draft Regulations on 
the Collection and Management of Social Compensation Fees in 
November 2014; \89\ as of July 2017, the Commission had not 
observed reports of the Chinese government issuing the 
regulations.
    In addition to fines, officials imposed or threatened other 
punishments for family planning violations. These punishments 
included detention,\90\ forced sterilization,\91\ and 
abortion.\92\ The PRC Population and Family Planning Law 
prohibits and provides punishments for officials' infringement 
on citizens' personal, property, and other rights while 
implementing population planning policies.\93\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Hukou Reform Addressing the Issue of ``Illegal Residents''
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, central and local
 governments continued to implement household registration (hukou)
 reforms to register ``illegal residents'' (heihu), a term commonly used
 to refer to people who lack hukou in China. According to 2010 national
 census data, there were approximately 13 million ``illegal residents''
 in China,\94\ of whom over 60 percent were people born in excess of
 birth quotas.\95\ Other reports indicated that the number of ``illegal
 residents'' might be higher than 13 million.\96\ These ``illegal
 residents'' face considerable difficulty accessing social benefits
 typically afforded to registered citizens, including government-
 subsidized healthcare, public education, and social security.\97\
 According to U.S.-based news media Duowei, survey data from the Chinese
 Academy of Macroeconomic Research of the National Development and
 Reform Commission showed that nearly half of the 13 million
 unregistered population were illiterate or people who had never
 received formal education, and about 43.8 percent of the unregistered
 population were unemployed.\98\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hukou Reform Addressing the Issue of ``Illegal Residents''-- Continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Central Party and government authorities issued directives during the
 Commission's previous reporting year to address the issue of ``illegal
 residents.'' \99\ According to a March 2017 People's Daily report, all
 31 provincial-level governments have issued implementing opinions for
 hukou reform, and approximately 14 million ``illegal residents'' have
 registered for hukou since November 2012.\100\ The state-run media
 China Central Television reported in February 2017 that authorities
 registered 1.435 million ``illegal residents'' in 2016.\101\ Some
 ``illegal residents,'' however, reportedly continued to face difficulty
 in registering for hukou, including those born to unmarried
 parents.\102\ According to a March 2017 People's Daily report, a
 Ministry of Public Security (MPS) official stated that the MPS aims to
 completely resolve the issue of ``illegal residents'' within the next
 two to three years.\103\ [For more information on China's hukou system,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Demographic Consequences of Population Control Policies
    Decades of population control policies have exacerbated 
China's demographic challenges, which include a rapidly aging 
population, shrinking workforce, and sex ratio imbalance. 
Affected in recent decades by government restrictions on the 
number of births per couple, China's total fertility rate has 
dropped from approximately 3 births per woman in the late 1970s 
\104\ to a reported 1.7 births per woman in 2017, below the 
replacement rate of 2.1 births per woman necessary to maintain 
a stable population.\105\ The fertility rate is even lower in 
some major cities, such as Shanghai municipality, which has a 
fertility rate of approximately 0.7 births per woman, 
reportedly one of the lowest in the world.\106\
    China's low fertility rate has contributed to a rapidly 
aging population and a shrinking workforce. According to a 
January 2017 National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) 
report, from 2015 to 2016, China's working-age population 
(persons between the ages of 16 and 59) declined by 3.49 
million people to 907.47 million, continuing a downward trend 
from the previous year.\107\ At the same time, the elderly 
population (persons aged 60 or older) increased by 
approximately 8.86 million in 2016 to 230.86 million people, or 
16.7 percent of the total population.\108\ According to the 
2017 State Council National Population Development Plan, 
China's working-age population is expected to decline rapidly 
from 2021 to 2030, while the elderly population will increase 
markedly during the same period and is predicted to reach a 
quarter of the population by 2030.\109\ Some population experts 
suggested that the elderly population would account for 
approximately one-third of China's total population by 2050, 
according to a China Daily report.\110\ These demographic 
trends reportedly may burden China's health care, public 
services, and retirement systems,\111\ and weaken China's 
economy as labor costs rise and competitiveness erodes.\112\
    The Chinese government's restrictive family planning 
policies also have exacerbated China's sex ratio imbalance. 
Although Chinese authorities continue to implement a ban on 
``non-medically necessary sex determination and sex-selective 
abortion,'' \113\ some people reportedly continue the practice 
in keeping with a traditional cultural preference for 
sons.\114\ According to an NBS report, China's overall sex 
ratio in 2016 was 104.98 males to 100 females, and there were 
approximately 33.59 million more males than females in China 
(708.15 million males to 674.56 million females).\115\ 
Demographic experts have expressed concerns that the sex ratio 
imbalance in China could lead to ``violent crime,'' \116\ ``sex 
crimes,'' ``trafficking of women,'' \117\ and social 
instability.\118\ This past year, international media reports 
continued to suggest a link between China's large number of 
``surplus males'' \119\ and the trafficking of foreign women--
from countries including Cambodia,\120\ Burma (Myanmar),\121\ 
North Korea,\122\ and Vietnam \123\--into China for forced 
marriage or commercial sexual exploitation. [For more 
information on cross-border trafficking, see Section II--Human 
Trafficking.]
    Reports also indicate that decades of birth limits under 
China's population control policies combined with a traditional 
preference for sons may have contributed to a black market for 
illegal adoptions.\124\ In November 2016, public security 
authorities in seven provinces detained 157 individuals 
involved in the acquisition and selling of children, and 
rescued 36 children, some of whom reportedly were 10 days old 
when taken.\125\ As of December 2016, authorities had not been 
able to locate the parents of at least nine of the 
children.\126\ According to reports, some parents sold their 
children because of financial difficulty, while some buyers 
wanted male children due to a traditional preference for 
sons.\127\

                          Freedom of Residence
    During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, the Chinese 
government continued to restrict the freedom of residence of 
Chinese citizens through the use of the household registration 
(hukou) system, established in 1958.\1\ The hukou system 
classifies Chinese citizens as rural or urban, conferring 
certain legal rights and access to public services based on the 
classification.\2\ Implementation of this system discriminates 
against rural hukou holders and migrants to urban areas by 
denying them equal access to public benefits and services 
enjoyed by registered urban residents, including housing, 
education, and social insurance.\3\ The hukou system 
contravenes international human rights standards guaranteeing 
freedom of residence and prohibiting discrimination on the 
basis of ``national or social origin, . . . birth or other 
status.'' \4\
    The Chinese government continued to implement reforms to 
residence policies, including the hukou and residence permit 
systems. Hukou reform, including the expansion to new urban 
residents and migrants of public benefits traditionally tied to 
hukou status, remained a policy goal for the Chinese 
government, as outlined in several national-level policy 
documents.\5\ In line with previous policy pronouncements aimed 
at increasing China's rate of urbanization,\6\ in September 
2016, the State Council issued a plan building on previous 
efforts to facilitate 100 million residents in obtaining urban 
hukou by 2020.\7\ The plan also calls for 45 percent of the 
population to have urban hukou by 2020.\8\ According to a 
February 2017 National Bureau of Statistics of China report, at 
the end of 2016, China's urban population stood at over 792.9 
million people, or 57.4 percent of the population; \9\ 41.2 
percent of the population were urban residents with urban-
registered hukou.\10\
    After the State Council issued national provisional 
regulations on residence permits that took effect in January 
2016,\11\ at least 29 provincial-level jurisdictions had 
reportedly issued implementing measures for residence permits 
as of August 2017.\12\ The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) 
reportedly announced that provincial- and local-level 
governments issued more than 28.9 million residence permits 
nationwide in 2016.\13\ The MPS also reportedly announced that 
provincial and local authorities nationwide abolished all 
previous temporary residence permit systems (zanzhuzheng) and 
replaced them with the newer residence permit systems 
(juzhuzheng).\14\
    In February 2017, the MPS reportedly confirmed a State 
Council decision \15\ that urban areas with fewer than 3 
million permanent residents would not be permitted under hukou 
reform policies to implement points systems to determine 
applicants' eligibility for obtaining local hukou.\16\ These 
systems assign values, determined by local governments, to 
migrants based on factors including education level, 
contributions to social insurance, and preferred work 
experience.\17\ Urban areas with populations above 3 million 
will be able to keep points systems and tighter restrictions on 
migrants' ability to apply for local hukou.\18\ A draft Beijing 
municipality planning document, for example, proposed setting a 
cap on Beijing's population at 23 million in 2020.\19\
    While some policymakers recognized the difficulties migrant 
workers face in settling in large cities and obtaining hukou or 
residence permits there, as well as the need to relax 
restrictions on in-migration,\20\ policy experts noted that 
existing proposals to reform the hukou and residence permit 
systems did not meaningfully address disparities in rural and 
urban status, especially as many rural-to-urban migrants seek 
economic opportunity in larger cities where in-migration 
remained strictly controlled.\21\
                          International Travel
    Chinese authorities continued to deny some citizens who 
criticized the government, those citizens' relatives and 
associates, and others--including ethnic minorities--their 
internationally recognized right to leave the country. Article 
12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
which China has signed and committed to ratify,\22\ provides 
that ``[e]veryone shall be free to leave any country . . ..'' 
\23\ Under Article 12, countries may restrict this right, but 
only ``to protect national security, public order'' and other 
select public interests.\24\ Chinese laws grant officials the 
authority to prevent from leaving the country those deemed 
threatening to state security or whose ``exit from China is not 
allowed.'' \25\ Chinese officials used this authority to 
arbitrarily keep government critics, rights defenders, and 
others from leaving China.\26\ The Commission observed the 
following representative cases during the 2017 reporting year:
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese authorities continued \27\ to restrict 
        the travel rights of individuals in connection with a 
        nationwide crackdown on public interest lawyers and 
        rights advocates that began in or around July 2015.\28\ 
        For example, in March 2017, public security authorities 
        in Shaanxi province refused to issue rights defender Lu 
        Dongli a passport or permit to travel to Hong Kong or 
        Macau, reportedly in connection with his support for 
        detainees in the July 2015 crackdown as well as his 
        interviews with foreign media about the crackdown.\29\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Beginning in October 2016, public security 
        officials in several county-level jurisdictions of the 
        Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) reportedly 
        ordered residents of those areas to turn in their 
        passports to authorities.\30\ Officials also required 
        residents to apply for approval before traveling 
        abroad.\31\ Rights organizations criticized the 
        passport confiscations as restricting the movement of 
        XUAR residents \32\ and serving as ``collective 
        punishment.'' \33\ In 2017, officials in some XUAR 
        jurisdictions also reportedly ordered around 200,000 
        ethnic Kazakhs to turn in their passports and 
        Kazakhstan permanent residence permits, though 
        officials subsequently returned at least some of the 
        documents.\34\ [For more information, see Section IV--
        Xinjiang--Freedom of Movement.]
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Chinese authorities threatened Tibetans who 
        traveled, or planned to travel, to India to participate 
        in a January 2017 religious gathering led by the Dalai 
        Lama.\35\ Officials in some parts of Gansu, Qinghai, 
        and Sichuan provinces seized passports from Tibetan 
        residents to prevent them from traveling.\36\ Chinese 
        authorities in some Tibetan areas destroyed the 
        religious pilgrims' passports upon their return to 
        China and questioned them about their activities in 
        India.\37\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In March 2017, Chinese authorities prevented 
        Feng Chongyi, a Chinese citizen and Australian 
        permanent resident, from leaving China after he spent 
        several weeks conducting research on Chinese rights 
        lawyers.\38\ Border control officials in Guangzhou 
        municipality, Guangdong province, detained Feng on 
        March 24 at the Guangzhou airport; authorities later 
        held him at a Guangzhou hotel.\39\ Feng's lawyer said 
        that authorities accused Feng of ``threatening national 
        security,'' and surmised that the travel restrictions 
        were due to Feng's research on rights lawyers detained 
        in the crackdown beginning in or around July 2015.\40\ 
        Authorities allowed Feng to return to Australia in 
        early April.\41\ Feng told Australian media that his 
        detention was meant to deter other academics from 
        researching ``sensitive issues or sensitive topics'' 
        related to China.\42\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; In March 2017, Chinese authorities reportedly 
        prevented several dozen mainland Chinese residents from 
        traveling to Hong Kong to participate in a history 
        seminar on the 1950s Anti-Rightist Movement.\43\ 
        Chinese authorities used a variety of means to dissuade 
        or prevent seminar participants from attending, 
        including confiscating their travel permits.\44\
                           Domestic Movement
    During this reporting year, the Commission observed reports 
of Chinese government officials punishing rights advocates and 
their families and associates, and targeting members of some 
ethnic minority groups, by restricting their freedom of 
movement domestically. Article 12 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights provides that ``[e]veryone 
lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that 
territory, have the right to liberty of movement . . ..'' \45\ 
Authorities increased restrictions on freedom of movement 
during politically sensitive periods, including before and 
during the May 2017 Belt and Road Initiative forum in Beijing 
municipality \46\ and the June 2017 anniversary of the 1989 
Tiananmen protests.\47\
    During the March 2017 meetings of the National People's 
Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference in Beijing (``Two Sessions''), Chinese authorities 
repeatedly seized or detained critics of the government as well 
as petitioners who sought meetings in Beijing with government 
officials, temporarily restricting their movement and sometimes 
forcibly returning them to their places of residence.\48\ 
During this time, authorities sent some individuals on ``forced 
travel'' (bei luyou), compelling them to leave their places of 
residence and preventing them from traveling to politically 
sensitive areas, especially Beijing.\49\ For example, 
authorities in Qianjiang municipality, Hubei province, forced 
former independent local people's congress candidate Yao Lifa 
to leave Qianjiang during the Two Sessions, reportedly moving 
him between five different provinces for 18 days before 
allowing him to return to Qianjiang.\50\ Local authorities 
sometimes held these individuals in ``black jails'' (hei 
jianyu), a form of extralegal confinement.\51\ Authorities also 
continued restrictions on the movement of lawyers, particularly 
lawyers who have worked on behalf of rights advocates or 
political prisoners, such as Liu Zhengqing \52\ and Chen 
Jian'gang.\53\ Before the May 2017 trial of Chen's former 
client Xie Yang, authorities in Yunnan province briefly 
detained Chen and his family, later forcibly escorting him back 
to Beijing.\54\
    Tibetans, Uyghurs, and other residents of ethnic minority 
areas in particular faced strict controls on their freedom of 
movement. Tibetans and residents of Tibetan areas had 
restrictions placed on their freedom of movement around the 
time of the March 2017 anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising 
against Chinese rule, including the imposition of requirements 
on some Tibetans to obtain local government approval for local 
travel.\55\ In February 2017, authorities in Gansu province 
prevented more than one thousand Tibetans from traveling to 
participate in a Tibetan Buddhist gathering at Kirti Monastery 
in Aba (Ngaba) county, Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous 
Prefecture, Sichuan province.\56\ Security officials in 
Bayinguoleng (Bayingol) Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region, reportedly ordered all drivers to 
have satellite navigation systems installed in their cars by 
June 30, 2017,\57\ effectively allowing authorities to surveil 
drivers.\58\ Authorities characterized the order as a counter-
terrorism measure.\59\ [For more information on government 
restrictions on Uyghurs and Tibetans, see Section IV--Xinjiang 
and Section V--Tibet.]

                        POLITICAL DECISIONMAKING
    The Chinese government is obligated under its international 
commitments \1\ and domestic laws \2\ to ensure gender-equal 
political participation; women, however, continued to be 
underrepresented in political decisionmaking positions. Female 
representation in top-level Communist Party and government 
leadership remains low or non-existent,\3\ and one scholar 
noted that it would likely remain negligible after the 
leadership change at the 19th National Congress of the Chinese 
Communist Party scheduled for autumn 2017.\4\
    Overall, representation at upper and lower levels of the 
government continues to fall short of the 30 percent target 
recommended by the UN Commission on the Status of Women.\5\ The 
proportion of female delegates at the 12th National People's 
Congress (NPC), seated in 2013, was 23.4 percent.\6\ A draft 
decision presented during the annual session of the 12th NPC in 
March 2017 projected that a greater proportion of female 
delegates would be elected to the 13th NPC in January 2018, but 
did not specify how.\7\
                       CIVIL SOCIETY AND ADVOCACY
    During the Commission's 2017 reporting year, Chinese 
officials prevented some women's rights advocates from engaging 
in activism and providing services--a continuation of the 
intensifying restrictions on women's rights advocacy that began 
in 2015 \8\--while promoting Party-affiliated alternatives for 
protecting women's rights and interests.
    A leading feminist activist described the political 
environment as ``very difficult'' and reported that independent 
groups were unable to organize activities on behalf of women's 
rights.\9\ Activists also voiced serious concern about online 
censorship after a social media company blocked a prominent 
social media account for women's rights, ``Feminist Voices,'' 
for 30 days in February 2017.\10\ The account shutdown was 
allegedly directed by the Cyberspace Administration of China, 
the government agency responsible for overseeing all online 
content.\11\ [For more information on censorship, see Section 
II--Freedom of Expression.]

      May 2017 ``Human Billboard'' Anti-Sexual Harassment Campaign
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  On May 1, 2017,\12\ women's rights advocate Zhang Leilei initiated an
 anti-sexual harassment campaign with the feminist group Women Awakening
 Network \13\ based in Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong province.\14\
 feminist group Women Awakening Network.\14\ Zhang recruited 100
 volunteers from across China via social media as ``human billboards''
 who would publicly carry posters to raise awareness about preventing
 sexual harassment on public transportation.\15\ Volunteers from at
 least 23 cities participated and around 10 feminist or LGBT groups held
 activities in conjunction with the campaign.\16\ Zhang started the
 campaign after authorities repeatedly refused permission for a crowd-
 funded advertisement against sexual harassment in a Guangzhou subway
 station.\17\ On May 17, 2017, authorities ordered Zhang to halt the
 billboard campaign because it was ``too large,'' comparing it to the
 planned anti-sexual harassment activity in March 2015 that led to the
 criminal detention of five women's rights advocates (also known as the
 Feminist Five).\18\ They also told Zhang to suspend all other
 activities and leave the city for the remainder of the year due to
 heightened public security in anticipation of the 2017 Fortune Global
 Forum to be held in Guangzhou in December.\19\ Guangzhou authorities
 also searched the home of three others involved in the campaign.\20\
 Zhang subsequently suspended the campaign and canceled a series of
 planned follow-up activities.\21\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In September 2016, the Party's Central Committee General 
Office launched a nationwide initiative to reform the Party-
affiliated All-China Women's Federation (ACWF).\22\ The reforms 
direct the ACWF to more actively intervene in individual cases 
to protect women against violations of their rights and 
interests, to improve aid delivery, and to enhance the ACWF's 
online presence.\23\ The initiative also charged the ACWF with 
``leading women to listen to the Party [and] follow the path of 
the Party'' and ``strengthening the leadership of the Party.'' 
\24\
    The Chinese government also continued to target individual 
women's rights advocates with criminal prosecution and other 
forms of harassment and intimidation.
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Foshan Intermediate People's Court in 
        Guangdong province convicted Su Changlan,\25\ an 
        influential organizer and advocate for women's rights 
        and democratic village elections, of ``inciting 
        subversion of state power'' on March 31, 2017.\26\ The 
        court sentenced Su to three years in prison and a 
        subsequent three-year deprivation of political 
        rights.\27\ Su is expected to be released in October 
        2017.\28\ Authorities repeatedly violated her legal and 
        procedural rights by holding her in secret detention, 
        denying her legal counsel, repeatedly extending her 
        detention before her trial in April 2016, and deferring 
        a judgment four times.\29\ In June 2017, her brother 
        reported that her life was ``definitely in danger'' 
        because of inadequate medical treatment,\30\ and 
        Amnesty International said in August 2017 that her 
        health suffered ``a sharp deterioration due to ill-
        treatment and poor detention conditions over the past 
        years.'' \31\ The UN Working Group on Arbitrary 
        Detention in 2015 determined that the Chinese 
        government had arbitrarily detained Su and called on 
        the government to release her immediately and grant 
        reparation for harm suffered during her detention.\32\ 
        Public security officials detained Su in October 2014 
        after she voiced support for the pro-democracy 
        demonstrations in Hong Kong.\33\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Also on March 31, 2017, the same Foshan court 
        sentenced Chen Qitang,\34\ to four years and six 
        months' imprisonment and three years' deprivation of 
        political rights for ``inciting subversion of state 
        power.'' \35\ Chen had worked with Su to document 
        domestic violence in Guangdong and actively published 
        essays critical of government policies.\36\ Authorities 
        prolonged his detention for more than two years.\37\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The Gangzha District People's Court in Nantong 
        municipality, Jiangsu province, convicted Shan 
        Lihua,\38\ a women's rights advocate, of ``picking 
        quarrels and provoking trouble'' in September 2016.\39\ 
        During her detention, authorities reportedly subjected 
        Shan to torture and other rights violations; her 
        brother stated that officials at the Nantong PSB 
        Detention Center beat her ``until she couldn't stand,'' 
        \40\ and that authorities refused her access to 
        counsel.\41\ The judgment sentencing Shan referenced 
        her protesting the sexual abuse of students by school 
        officials in Hainan province in 2013 and the detention 
        of women's rights advocate Ye Haiyan.\42\
        &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Local authorities in Beijing municipality 
        repeatedly pressured Ye Haiyan, a prominent advocate 
        for women, commercial sex workers, and people living 
        with AIDS, to move residences between January and March 
        2017.\43\ [For more information on restrictions on 
        residence and movement prior to the annual meetings of 
        the National People's Congress and Chinese People's 
        Political Consultative Conference, see Section II--
        Freedom of Residence and Movement.] Ye reportedly 
        remained under constant surveillance by authorities, 
        and was unable to participate in public demonstrations 
        or leave the country after Chinese authorities told her 
        that her passport was ``lost'' after she attempted to 
        apply for a visa in 2014.\44\ A U.S.-based filmmaker 
        making a documentary about Ye's activism reported that 
        officials threatened the filmmaker's family in China in 
        order to discourage her from releasing the film.\45\
                      Gender-Based Discrimination
                               EMPLOYMENT
    Women in China continued to face a variety of 
institutional, legal, and social barriers to equal employment, 
which the Chinese government is obligated to address under its 
international commitments \46\ and domestic laws.\47\ Employers 
frequently discriminate against women in recruiting,\48\ 
hiring,\49\ and promotion.\50\ Although existing laws prohibit 
such practices,\51\ the system for enforcement remains 
inadequate: Repercussions for violating the law are rare \52\ 
and negligible,\53\ and victims of discrimination at work are 
reluctant to seek a legal remedy due to the risk of dismissal 
and time involved.\54\ Discriminatory legal policies also 
continued to bar women from performing certain jobs--in some 
cases based on whether they are menstruating, pregnant, or 
breastfeeding.\55\ Disparities in the workplace also manifested 
in widespread sexual harassment \56\ and women earning on 
average 65 percent of what men earn.\57\ Although the 
Commission did not observe statistics on the pay gap for rural 
women this past year, in 2011 women's income was 56 percent 
that of men's in rural areas,\58\ despite the fact that women 
reportedly make up a majority of the rural labor force, 
according to a February 2015 news report.\59\
    Experts and female respondents to a recent survey 
attributed much of the discrimination against women in 
employment to employers' desire to avoid the cost of maternity 
leave for female employees.\60\ An All-China Women's Federation 
survey found that 54.7 percent of employers asked women about 
their marital status and reproduction-related issues during the 
interview process, and many women reported that employer 
concerns about maternity had resulted in reduced salary and 
impeded career development and advancement.\61\ In another 
survey, the greatest proportion of women reporting gender 
discrimination were those between 25 and 34, particularly those 
without children.\62\ Experts said that such discrimination 
would likely be exacerbated by the ``universal two-child 
policy'' implemented in January 2016.\63\ [For more information 
on the ``universal two-child policy,'' see Section II--
Population Control.]
    Some women continued to demand more active enforcement of 
existing Chinese law through gender discrimination lawsuits, 
the first of which was reportedly settled out of court in 
2013.\64\ In September 2016, Gao Xiao (pseudonym) obtained a 
judgment from the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court in 
Guangdong province for 2,000 yuan (US$300) and a public apology 
from a restaurant chain that refused to interview or hire her 
for a chef's apprentice position based on her gender.\65\ In 
March 2017, following the company's inaction, the court again 
ordered the restaurant to publicly apologize.\66\ In another 
case in July 2017, a university student filed the first gender-
based employment discrimination suit in Shenzhen municipality, 
Guangdong, against the Shenzhen Municipal Human Resources and 
Social Security Bureau for failing to address her complaint 
regarding a discriminatory job recruitment advertisement posted 
online by a local business.\67\
    Some Chinese government officials promoted the use of law 
to resolve gender discrimination issues in employment. The 
Supreme People's Court (SPC) included a recent gender 
discrimination case among the guiding cases released in August 
2016,\68\ making it a judgment that courts ``at all levels 
should refer to . . . when adjudicating similar cases.'' \69\ 
The judgment granted compensation to a female plaintiff who 
sued a courier service that refused to hire her because of her 
gender.\70\ SPC official Guo Feng said that imposing civil 
liability would deter employers from discriminating on the 
basis of gender.\71\ In March 2017, several National People's 
Congress (NPC) delegates spoke out in support of creating an 
anti-discrimination law for employment to address widespread 
discrimination.\72\
                            PROPERTY RIGHTS
    Women, particularly after marriage, continued to lack 
secure rights to property in both rural and urban areas due to 
a combination of legal policies and traditionalist cultural 
pressures. One NPC Standing Committee member noted that rural 
women continue to face challenges in asserting rights to land 
due to a lack of decisionmaking power at both the household and 
village level.\73\ According to a 2016 interview with a Chinese 
professor, 18 percent of married rural women did not have their 
names included on the land contracts of the household of either 
their husband or parents, and nearly 53 percent of married 
women had had land contracts canceled by their home villages as 
of 2014.\74\ Urban women also face difficulties defending their 
property rights; for example, in fall 2016, a court ruled 
against a woman who, after her husband proposed divorce, sued 
to have her name added to the title of a home she had 
contributed to purchasing.\75\ A 2011 Supreme People's Court 
interpretation of the PRC Marriage Law grants property in a 
divorce to the party named on the deed.\76\ Research from 2012 
indicated that a majority of married women or their families 
contribute to the purchase of homes, but most women are not 
named on the deed of the home.\77\
                         Violence Against Women
    Women in China continued to face challenges with domestic 
and sexual violence as officials continued to develop a legal 
and institutional infrastructure to prevent such abuse. All-
China Women's Federation statistics show that ``30 percent of 
married women have experienced some form of domestic 
violence.'' \78\ At the end of June 2017, courts reportedly had 
issued 1,284 total protection orders under the PRC Anti-
Domestic Violence Law,\79\ in effect since March 2016.\80\ 
Experts on the domestic violence law note that challenges to 
implementation include lack of awareness,\81\ inadequate 
resources for training of officials,\82\ gender discrimination 
within the legal system,\83\ and enforcement that prioritizes 
family cohesion and ``social stability'' over the safety of 
victims.\84\ Victims of sexual violence also face challenges in 
obtaining legal redress--experts note that victims of sexual 
harassment are reluctant to come forward due to pressure from 
family and society.\85\ A 2013 UN study found that nearly one 
in five Chinese women reported being the victims of rape,\86\ 
and a 2015 survey of Chinese college students found that 34.8 
percent of female respondents (and 35.6 percent of male 
respondents) had experienced sexual harassment or violence.\87\ 
The non-governmental organization China Labour Bulletin noted 
that while sexual harassment is ``widespread,'' it is rare for 
women to obtain justice through the legal system.\88\

                           Human Trafficking
                       Defining Human Trafficking
    As a State Party to the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children (UN TIP Protocol),\1\ China is obligated to enact 
legislation criminalizing human trafficking as defined by the 
UN TIP Protocol.\2\ The definition of human trafficking under 
the PRC Criminal Law,\3\ however, remains inconsistent with UN 
TIP Protocol standards.\4\ The UN TIP Protocol definition of 
human trafficking involves three components: the action of 
recruiting, transporting, harboring, or receiving persons; the 
means of coercion, deception, or control; \5\ and ``the purpose 
of exploitation,'' including sexual exploitation or forced 
labor.\6\ Chinese law focuses on the act of selling a woman or 
child,\7\ rather than the purpose of exploitation.\8\ The 
definition of trafficking in the PRC Criminal Law does not 
clearly cover all forms of trafficking in the UN TIP 
Protocol,\9\ including certain types of non-physical coercion; 
\10\ offenses against male victims; \11\ and forced labor,\12\ 
though forced labor is illegal under a separate provision of 
the law.\13\ In addition, the Chinese legal definition of 
trafficking includes the purchase or abduction of children for 
subsequent sale without specifying the purpose of these 
actions.\14\ Under the UN TIP Protocol, illegal adoptions 
constitute trafficking only if the purpose is exploitation.\15\ 
Human trafficking experts note a dearth of reliable statistics 
on the scale of human trafficking in general; \16\ in China, 
inconsistencies between domestic law and international 
standards further contribute to the difficulty of assessing the 
scale of human trafficking.\17\ A scholar with the Centre for 
Human Rights Studies at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, 
argued that the discrepancies in the Chinese legal definition 
make international comparisons of human trafficking difficult 
and have ``serious, negative implications for formulating an 
effective national anti-trafficking strategy.'' \18\
                        Trends and Developments
                        CROSS-BORDER TRAFFICKING
    China remains a destination country for the trafficking of 
men, women, and children from throughout Asia,\19\ and a source 
country for trafficking to Europe, the United States, and 
elsewhere.\20\ Vietnamese media reported an increase in the 
number of victims of human trafficking in 2016; the majority of 
cases were reportedly women trafficked to China for forced 
marriage or sexual exploitation.\21\ According to a study of 
trafficked men and boys, Vietnamese males were also trafficked 
to China for the purpose of forced labor in factories.\22\ 
Burmese and Cambodian nationals were reportedly trafficked to 
China for forced marriage and forced labor,\23\ and Nepalese 
and Lao women were reportedly trafficked to China for sexual 
exploitation.\24\ According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime 
and the International Organization for Migration, China is also 
a source country for human trafficking to Europe.\25\ This past 
year, the Commission observed reports of alleged human 
trafficking of Chinese nationals to the United States \26\ and 
elsewhere \27\ for forced labor and sexual exploitation.
                          DOMESTIC TRAFFICKING
    According to UN Action for Cooperation against Trafficking 
in Persons (UN-ACT), men, women, and children were trafficked 
within China's borders for forced labor, forced begging, forced 
marriage, and sexual exploitation.\28\ During this reporting 
year, the Commission observed domestic media reports of women, 
including women with intellectual disabilities, trafficked for 
the purpose of forced marriage,\29\ and of men trafficked for 
forced labor in brick kilns in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangdong 
provinces.\30\ A case involving the use of child labor by 
clothing manufacturers in Jiangsu province,\31\ also appeared 
to constitute trafficking for forced labor, as employers 
reportedly used violence against the children and withheld pay 
and identity documents.\32\ [For more information on this case 
and child labor in China, see Section II--Worker Rights--Child 
Labor.]
                   GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED FORCED LABOR
    This past year, the Chinese government subjected 
individuals to forced labor during pretrial detention and while 
held in administrative detention centers. The International 
Labour Organization (ILO) definition of forced labor makes an 
exception for labor performed ``as a consequence of a 
conviction in a court of law . . .''; \33\ however, the 
Commission observed reports of individuals performing forced 
labor in detention before trial.\34\ In a form of 
administrative detention known as compulsory drug 
detoxification, authorities detained suspected drug users 
without trial and reportedly required them to perform 
labor.\35\ According to a March 2017 article in the state-run 
news agency Xinhua, one compulsory drug detoxification center 
in Shaanxi province typically held detainees for two years.\36\ 
The center provided education and training for two months, and 
for the remainder of the time, detainees ``participated in 
handicraft labor.'' \37\ As the government does not convict 
compulsory detoxification detainees in court, the requirement 
to perform labor constitutes forced labor under the ILO 
definition \38\ and human trafficking under the UN TIP 
Protocol.\39\ Compulsory drug detoxification centers are 
similar to reeducation through labor (RTL),\40\ another form of 
administrative punishment in which detainees were detained 
without trial \41\ and subjected to forced labor.\42\ Although 
the government abolished RTL in 2013,\43\ Zhang Sujun, Vice 
Minister of the Ministry of Justice, said in November 2014 that 
authorities had converted most RTL facilities to compulsory 
drug detoxification centers.\44\
    According to the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), authorities 
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) subjected some 
Uyghur residents to hashar, a type of forced labor for public 
works projects.\45\ A November 2016 WUC report found that some 
local governments in the XUAR periodically required Uyghur 
residents to participate in forced labor under threat of 
financial penalty and detention.\46\ In February 2017, Uyghur 
farmers told Radio Free Asia that local officials claimed to 
have abolished hashar, yet still required Uyghur residents to 
participate in flood control and tree planting.\47\ Government-
sponsored compulsory labor constitutes forced labor as defined 
by the ILO \48\ and human trafficking under the UN TIP 
Protocol.\49\ [For more information on forced labor in the 
XUAR, see Section IV--Xinjiang.]
                              Risk Factors
    This past year, Chinese workers migrating within China and 
individuals with disabilities were at risk of human 
trafficking, and government restrictions on worker rights 
exacerbated this risk. Despite reforms, international observers 
reported that the household registration (hukou) system 
continued to disadvantage and marginalize internal migrant 
workers,\50\ reportedly exacerbating their vulnerability to 
trafficking.\51\ Migrant workers' children, often unable to 
migrate with their parents due in part to the hukou system,\52\ 
were also at an increased risk for human trafficking.\53\ [For 
more information on the hukou system, see Section II--Freedom 
of Residence and Movement.] Individuals with disabilities were 
at risk for forced marriage and forced labor, including forced 
begging.\54\ The Chinese government limits workers' right to 
freedom of association by restricting independent unions \55\ 
and limiting the right to collective bargaining.\56\ A 
September 2016 UN report noted that the government's failure to 
protect workers' fundamental right to freedom of association 
limits workers' ability to advocate for their rights, 
``directly contribut[ing] to problems such as human trafficking 
and slavery.'' \57\ [For more information on restrictions on 
worker rights in China, see Section II--Worker Rights.]
    In addition to domestic human trafficking, men, women, and 
children in neighboring countries face the risk of human 
trafficking into China. Poverty in Southeast Asian countries 
contributes to human trafficking from that region.\58\ Migrants 
and women are particularly at risk.\59\ The Chinese government 
continued to treat North Korean refugees as economic migrants 
and maintained a policy of repatriating undocumented North 
Koreans,\60\ leaving the refugees, who are predominantly women, 
vulnerable to trafficking for forced marriage.\61\ 
Additionally, the government of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) reportedly continued to generate 
revenue by sending North Korean nationals to work in China 
under conditions that one expert described as slave labor.\62\ 
Reporting from this past year indicated that North Korean 
security personnel accompanied the workers and withheld their 
passports.\63\ Workers reportedly worked up to 20 hours per day 
and typically did not receive their wages until they returned 
to North Korea.\64\ [For more information, see Section II--
North Korean Refugees in China.]
    China's sex ratio imbalance--exacerbated by government-
imposed birth limits and in keeping with a traditional bias for 
sons \65\--created a demand for marriageable women that may 
contribute to human trafficking for forced marriage and sexual 
exploitation.\66\ According to the National Bureau of 
Statistics of China, in 2016, China had approximately 33.59 
million more men than women.\67\ The official sex ratio at 
birth was approximately 113.5 boys born for every 100 girls in 
2015.\68\ According to demographers, a typical sex ratio at 
birth is within the range of 103 to 107 boys born for every 100 
girls.\69\ As of August 2017, the government had not released 
the sex ratio at birth for 2016. [For more information on 
China's population policies, see Section II--Population 
Control.]
                        Anti-Trafficking Efforts
    During this reporting year, the Supreme People's Court 
(SPC) issued an interpretation on the trafficking of women and 
children, while the number of human trafficking cases tried in 
the courts declined. The December 2016 SPC interpretation 
clarified the application of the law in trying trafficking 
cases.\70\ The interpretation specified the meaning of certain 
terms used in anti-trafficking provisions of the PRC Criminal 
Law,\71\ including defining ``children'' as under the age of 
14.\72\ This is inconsistent with the UN TIP Protocol, which 
defines children as under the age of 18.\73\ Additionally, the 
SPC Information Center and Judicial Cases Research Institute 
reported that Chinese courts tried 4 percent fewer human 
trafficking cases in the first nine months of 2016 than in the 
same period in 2015.\74\
    The Ministry of Public Security maintained a mobile 
application (app) launched in May 2016 to locate missing 
children.\75\ The app reportedly assisted in locating 533 
missing children, including 21 trafficked children, as of 
December 2016.\76\ This figure relies upon the definition of 
human trafficking in Chinese law,\77\ which does not conform to 
the UN TIP Protocol.\78\
    The Chinese government continued its involvement in the 
Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative Against Trafficking 
(COMMIT),\79\ developing with other member states a set of 
common indicators of human trafficking and common guidelines 
for identifying trafficking victims.\80\ UN Action for 
Cooperation against Trafficking in Persons (UN-ACT), a project 
of the UN Development Programme that serves as the COMMIT 
Secretariat,\81\ reported that the new indicators and 
guidelines aimed to improve victim identification and service 
provision.\82\
                               Hong Kong
    This past year, Hong Kong remained \83\ a destination for 
human trafficking, with migrant domestic workers (MDWs) 
particularly at risk of exploitation for forced labor. The Hong 
Kong Census and Statistics Department's 2016 annual digest 
reported that in 2015, there were over 340,000 MDWs working for 
households in Hong Kong, the majority of whom came from the 
Philippines and Indonesia.\84\ According to local and regional 
non-governmental organizations, MDWs are often in debt due to 
excessive fees paid to employment agencies both in their home 
countries and in Hong Kong, and many employers exert control 
over MDWs by confiscating their passports, preventing them from 
contacting friends and family, and in some cases through 
physical and emotional abuse.\85\ Local advocacy groups noted 
that two regulations--requiring MDWs to live with their 
employers \86\ and to leave Hong Kong within two weeks of 
termination of a contract \87\--contributed to MDWs' risk of 
exploitation for forced labor.\88\
    A December 2016 ruling by the High Court of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region, Court of First Instance, found 
that Hong Kong's laws do not adequately address human 
trafficking.\89\ The current definition of human trafficking in 
Hong Kong's Crimes Ordinance covers only the cross-border 
movement of persons ``for the purpose of prostitution'' and not 
other forms of trafficking such as trafficking within Hong 
Kong's borders and forced labor.\90\ A victim of human 
trafficking challenged the Hong Kong government in court, 
arguing that Hong Kong's Bill of Rights Ordinance requires the 
Hong Kong government to enact stronger anti-trafficking 
legislation.\91\ In December 2016, the court ruled in favor of 
the victim, finding that the Hong Kong government had an 
obligation under the Bill of Rights Ordinance ``to enact 
measures to ensure the prohibition of forced or compulsory 
labour.'' \92\ Hong Kong lawmaker Kenneth Leung submitted 
questions to the Hong Kong government regarding what steps it 
had taken following the December 2016 ruling.\93\ The 
government responded in June 2017 that it ``attaches great 
importance to combating [trafficking in persons],'' but also 
stated that human trafficking ``is not prevalent or widespread 
in Hong Kong,'' and that human trafficking ``is effectively 
prohibited by various pieces of existing legislation in Hong 
Kong.'' \94\ While China acceded to the UN TIP Protocol in 
2010, the Chinese central government has not extended the 
Protocol to apply to Hong Kong.\95\ [For more information on 
Hong Kong, see Section VI--Developments in Hong Kong and
