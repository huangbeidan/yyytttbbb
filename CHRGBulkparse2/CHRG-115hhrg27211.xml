                              ----------                              
                                          Wednesday, March 1, 2017.
                              MEMBERS' DAY
    Mr. Cole [presiding]. Good morning. It is my pleasure to 
welcome you all to the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human 
Services, and Education for our first hearing of the year.
    We are looking forward to taking testimony from members of 
Congress this morning. This sort of member day has not been 
held on this subcommittee in at least a decade. And the idea to 
return to this practice is one that was suggested by our new 
full committee chairman, Rodney Frelinghuysen, and, frankly, I 
think it is a good idea. And if I did not think so, I would 
still say I thought it was a good idea. [Laughter.]
    But I actually do think it is a great idea, and he does 
deserve credit for it. It is an opportunity for any member of 
Congress to come before the panel and draw our attention to 
particular issues of importance in both their districts as well 
as across the Nation. I look forward to hearing from my 
colleagues about the challenges they see and how this 
subcommittee can help address them.
    As a reminder to everyone, we really will abide by the 5-
minute rule so that we are able to keep closely to the schedule 
we outlined for members. Before we begin, though, I would like 
to turn to my ranking member for any remarks that she would 
care to make.
    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I 
concur. I think this is a wonderful opportunity to hear from 
our colleagues on the issues they care about in this, what I 
view as an extraordinary subcommittee of appropriations. And I 
am happy to see Mr. Thompson here. This is the second time we 
have gathered this morning. We were just earlier at the 
Submarine Industrial Base Council meeting.
    I am heartened that so many of our colleagues are going to 
testify here this morning, and looking forward to hearing from 
them about how the programs that are part of the portfolio that 
we have jurisdiction over affects your constituents.
    I have to add, though, that we have heard that the 
Administration wants to cut non-defense by about 
$54,000,000,000, and I think we would agree that this could 
have a very profound negative impact on the Labor, HHS, 
Education programs. Our bill comprises nearly one-third of the 
non-defense discretionary spending, so if you take a look at 
what that proposed reduction would do, it would cut nearly 
about $18,000,000,000 from this subcommittee.
    There is a very good reason that the Labor-H Committee has 
been called the people's bill because it does provide an 
opportunity for people to help meet their needs. When we do 
lifesaving biomedical research, we equip our Nation to deal 
with public health emergencies. We level the playing field for 
low-income children looking to learn. We help Americans get the 
skills that they need to find a job in a tough economy.
    So, these efforts all impact the lives of our constituents 
and Americans all over this Nation. And, therefore, these kinds 
of cuts would impact each and every American, especially 
children, families, and seniors.
    So, looking forward to listening to all of our colleagues 
here today and what their priorities are to ensure that we keep 
our promise to the American people. Thanks very much.
    Mr. Cole. Thank you for your remarks. And with that, Mr. 
Thompson, it is good to have you here, my friend. And you are 
recognized for 5 minutes for whatever remarks you would care to 
make.

HON. GLENN THOMPSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
    PENNSYLVANIA
    Mr. Thompson. Well, thank you. Chairman Cole and Ranking 
Member DeLauro, it is a privilege and an honor to be able to be

    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS"&gt;CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER
JAMES E. SHMERLING, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS"&gt;Mr. Cole [presiding]. Good morning. It is my pleasure to 
welcome everyone--thank you--to the Subcommittee on Labor, 
Health, Human Services, and Education for a very special 
hearing. This is our public witness day, and it provides an 
opportunity for members of the public to come before this panel 
and draw our attention to particular issues of importance to 
them. I always look forward to hearing from our public 
witnesses as we learn as much about the challenges facing our 
people and what this subcommittee can do to help solve them.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS"&gt;Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that we need to 
strictly adhere to the 5-minute rule so that we will be able to 
keep closely the schedule and hear from everyone before votes 
are called. For our witnesses a 5-minute minute block will 
count down on the microphone box in front of you. When you have 
one-minute remaining, the light will turn yellow and you should 
begin to wrap up your testimony at that point. Remember that 
your full written statement will appear in the hearing record.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS"&gt;And just for purposes of the committee, this will obviously 
not be a question and answer and dialogue, although at the end 
of each witness I will certainly allow anybody that wants to to 
make a remark or ask a quick question. But let us try and move 
along just for the convenience of all the folks who have come a 
long way to be with us and to offer testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS"&gt;    And with that, I would like to turn to our ranking member, 
who has laryngitis today, so you guys be kind.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is
really a delight to have this public witness hearing this year, 
express my gratitude as well to all of the witnesses. And thank 
you for taking the time to speak to us, but for all the work 
that you do on behalf of American families. And we are eager to 
hear from all of you, so I will be brief and I apologize for my 
voice. Nineteen witnesses, all aspects of the committee's 
jurisdiction: education, healthcare, programs that benefit 
everyone from infants to seniors, universities, STEM education, 
and much more.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;The Labor HHS bill is called the people's bill. The reason 
for that is because it is about providing constituencies and 
people with opportunities to be able to get ahead. And they are 
the programs that directly impact the lives of Americans. So, I 
say thank you to you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;And I just want to make a point, that the range of programs 
here are so important, but you are all tireless in your 
advocacy on these issues, and we thank you for that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;The hearing that we had last week, both the chairman and I 
mentioned that we have got the potential for a $54,000,000,000 
cut to non-defense discretionary spending. This would have a 
profound effect on the programs under the portfolio of Labor, 
Health, Education, and Human Services, because Labor HHS is 
one-third of non-defense discretionary spending, so that could 
potentially be a cut of about $18,000,000,000.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;The chairman said last week, and I agree with him and I 
know he has been saying this, is that we cannot afford to 
balance the budget on the back of non-defense discretionary 
efforts. So, I think you will explain why you believe that the 
programs that you are espousing or the efforts that you are 
espousing are worthy and why we should be reinvesting urgently 
in your priorities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;    So, I very, very much look forward to hearing your 
testimony this morning. Many thanks.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;I thank the gentlelady, and with apologies ahead
of time I may well mispronounce names. Feel free to correct me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;    We have as our first public witness, is it Shermie?
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shmerling&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt; Shmerling.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt; Shmerling, okay. James Shmerling, the president
and chief executive officer of the Connecticut Children's 
Medical Center. Sir, you are recognized for 5 minutes to offer 
whatever remarks you care to the committee.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Shmerling&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;Thank you. Chairman Kohl, Ranking Member
DeLauro, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify in support of the Children's Hospital 
Graduate Medical Education Program, or CHGME.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;I am Jim Shmerling, president and CEO of Connecticut 
Children's Medical Center in Hartford, Connecticut. On behalf 
of Connecticut Children's and the Children's Hospital 
Association, I respectfully request that the subcommittee 
provide $300,000,000 for the CHGME Program in Fiscal Year 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;A robust pediatric workforce is essential to ensuring that 
all children can access high-quality medical care. CHGME 
supports this goal by providing funding for the training of 
pediatric providers at independent children's hospitals. Much 
as Medicare supports training and teaching hospitals that 
primarily serve adults, CHGME benefits children across the 
Nation by supporting the training of doctors who go on to care 
for children living in every State.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;Since the program's beginning, CHGME has enjoyed strong 
bipartisan support in Congress under both Republican and 
Democratic leadership. For Fiscal Year 2016, Congress provided 
$295,000,000 for CHGME, the program's first funding increase 
since Fiscal Year 2010. For Fiscal Year 2017, both the House 
and Senate Labor Health and Human Service Appropriations 
Subcommittees recommended $300,000,000 in funding for CHGME.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;Furthermore, bipartisan legislation reauthorizing CHGME 
through Fiscal Year 2018 was enacted in 2014, demonstrating the 
high level of ongoing support among lawmakers for the program. 
Children's hospitals are extremely grateful for the strong 
commitment to the health of America's children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;Congress created CHGME in 1999 because it recognized that 
the absence of dedicated CHGME funding for freestanding 
children's teaching hospitals created gaps in training of 
pediatric providers, potentially threatening children's access 
to care. At that time, independent children's hospitals, like 
Connecticut Children's, were effectively left out of the 
Federal GME support provided through Medicare because we treat 
children, not the elderly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;Since 1999, the CHGME Program has had a tremendous impact. 
Although the 58 hospitals that currently receive CHGME funding 
compromise only 1 percent of all hospitals, they train half of 
all pediatric residents, more 7,000 annually, including 44 
percent of all general pediatricians and 57 percent of all 
pediatric specialists.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;To provide an example of the impact from my own hospital, 
Connecticut Children's is the academic home for the Department 
of Pediatrics at the University of Connecticut School of 
Medicine, and we serve as the principal training site for the 
university's pediatric residency program, the pediatric 
fellowship programs, and medical student pediatric education. 
We have 63 pediatric residents at any given time. They are 
engaged in learning onsite and in the Greater Hartford area.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;CHGME funding supports the provision of their curriculum 
under the expertise of a highly-qualified faculty with a 
diverse population of patients and health needs. In 2016, 126 
of our residency and fellowship program graduates were 
practicing in Connecticut. While many of their colleagues have 
moved on to practice all over the country, America's children 
rely on the training provided by hospitals like ours that 
receive CHGME funds.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;CHGME has allowed children's hospitals to develop training 
programs in highly-specialized disciplines that target the 
unique needs of children. Some examples include pediatric 
surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pediatric pathology, and 
bone marrow transplantation. Only a small number of 
institutions provide training in those areas. CHGME is vital to 
maintaining and expanding programs focused on those sub-
specialties.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;However, while much has been achieved in strengthening the 
pediatric workforce, still more remains to be done. The 
national population of children continues to increase, and the 
number of children with complex medical conditions is growing 
at a faster rate than the overall child population, requiring 
an increasing number of specialty care providers. Nationwide, 
serious pediatric workforce shortages persist, most acutely 
among pediatric sub-specialties. Localized shortages of 
pediatric primary care providers also continue particularly in 
certain rural areas. Strengthening funding for CHGME will help 
all children and their families, including those with rare and 
complex conditions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;Even with CHGME, children's hospitals incur significant 
additional costs in support of their teaching missions. Without 
CHGME, hospitals will be at risk of having to cut back training 
experience in patient care services. This would negatively 
impact children's access to care and the future of the 
pediatric workforce.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;We recognize that the current budget climate is 
extraordinarily challenging and Congress has a responsibility 
to carefully consider the Nation's spending priorities. 
However, continued needs of the pediatric workforce, in 
particular with respect to specialty shortages, point to the 
necessity of strengthening funding for the program. Now is the 
time to take a step forward in pediatric medicine to ensure our 
children have access to health services they need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Shmerling"&gt;On behalf of Connecticut Children's Medical Center, the 
Children's Hospital Association, and the children's families we 
serve, thank you for your past support for this critical 
program. We request we respectfully request that the 
subcommittee continue its bipartisan support of children's 
health and CHGME at its authorized funding level of 
$300,000,000 in the Fiscal Year 2018 Labor Health and Human

ERIN SIEFRING, CHAIR, COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION COALITION
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Siefring&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Thank you. Chairman Cole and Ranking Member
DeLauro, I am Erin Siefring, chair of the Computer Science 
Education Coalition. Thank you for the opportunity to testify 
before you and all the members of the subcommittee today on a 
critical issue that greatly impacts the economic 
competitiveness and national security of the United States, K 
through 12 computer science education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Our country is falling far behind in this area with real 
impacts to our homeland security and our economic base. 
Prioritizing funding at the Department of Education for 
computer science education by the subcommittee can address this 
problem and give Americans the tools they need to protect our 
country and grow the economy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Computer science is a foundational skill for 21st century 
jobs. This skill is in high demand in our military and 
throughout the private sector. However, the United States is 
failing to take the necessary steps to equip our current and 
future workforce with the computer science skills needed to 
fill these positions to remain globally competitive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;The crisis in computer science funding extends to defending 
the homeland against cyber threats. Cybersecurity attacks 
against the United States are on the rise. But as the Center 
for Strategic and International Studies explains, there are 
only about a thousand security specialists in the United States 
who have the specialized skills to operate effectively in 
cyberspace. However, the United States needs about 10,000 to 
30,000 such individuals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;This shortage decreases our country's ability to defend 
itself in a time where a single bad actor with an advanced 
knowledge of computers, networks, and cybersecurity can do 
immense damage to the United States just by hitting the enter 
key on their laptop. To reverse this trend and bolster our 
national security, an investment in computer science education 
is needed now. Failure to make this investment in a timely 
manner will only compound the problem going forward and 
increase the national security risk to the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Already less than half of K through 12 classrooms in the 
United States teach computer science. Yet according to 
Code.org, computer science-based employment will make up two-
thirds of all projected new jobs in the science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, fields. The United 
States K through 12 education system simply is not graduating 
students with the computer science skills needed to meet the 
current or growing demand for computer science jobs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Today's students need to be learning about algorithms, how 
to make an app, code, or do robotics. These are the critical 
thinking skills today's students need to become the innovators 
and cyber warriors of tomorrow. These skills are needed 
throughout the economy. There are currently over 50,000 good 
paying computing jobs unfilled across the country. They are 
unfilled in large part because we are not making the investment 
necessary in computer science education. Indeed, computing jobs 
are the number one source of new wages in the United State.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;To fill these job openings in recent years, American 
companies have often had to import talent from across the 
globe. In fact, the majority of high-skilled immigration is for 
computer scientists, and almost 60 percent of skilled worker 
visas granted were for computer science operations. Our failure 
to invest in our future has forced U.S. businesses to recruit 
overseas for positions that could be filled domestically.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;To address this issue, last year America's leading CEOs, 
educators, and nonprofit leaders united with 28 Republican and 
Democrat governors, including then Governor Mike Pence, to send 
a letter to Congress asking for funding to provide every 
student in every school the opportunity to learn computer 
science. The signatories included Fortune 100 CEOs across 
multiple industries, which illustrates how many sectors of our 
economy are impacted by the current skills gap in computer 
science.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;State and private efforts are vital, but not enough on 
their own to fix the skills gap in computer science. We are 
lagging behind other nations that have prioritized the teaching 
of this critical subject. A Federal investment is necessary to 
amplify and accelerate the work already being done around this 
issue in the United States.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Since the Computer Science Education launched a year ago 
today, there has been significant bipartisan support for 
computer science education in both the House and the Senate. 
The coalition appreciates the robust demonstration of 
bipartisan leadership.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;An investment in computer science education by this 
subcommittee will be an investment in our country's future. The 
Computer Science Coalition urges the members of this 
subcommittee and Congress to prioritize an investment in 
computer science education to help defend the homeland and keep 
our economy strong.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Thank you for your time and attention to this critical 
matter.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;[The information follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. You might care to comment quickly on this or ask 
a question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Fleischmann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ms. 
Siefring. I appreciate this, and to my Democratic colleagues as 
well. This is an area where we've had tremendous bipartisan 
cooperation and support.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Just about a week and a half ago in Chattanooga, my 
hometown, we went over to the Howard High School. The members 
of your coalition were there. I went to an elementary school 
where second graders actually taught me how to code. It is 
really incredible the enthusiasm that the students have. 
Employers need this. The students need it, and I am going to be 
working with Ms. Lee, my colleague from the other side of the 
aisle--she is not here yet today--from Oakland.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;One of the other areas, too, that I would respectfully 
suggest we all work together is in the inner city because we 
have a lot of underserved schools in the inner city. I was just 
so impressed again at Howard High School.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;But thank you for your efforts. I am going to continue to 
be an advocate and look forward to the bipartisan cooperation 
on this key issue. And I thank the chairman for his continued 
support as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Certainly well-behaved second graders could 
teach this Congress a great deal actually. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Mr. Chairman, just for the record----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Certainly.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro [continuing]. Ms. Lee is at the MilCon hearing 
this morning, so otherwise she would be here joining Mr. 
Fleischmann. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Absolutely. We want to thank you for your 
testimony, and we will certainly take it under consideration. 
And next witness, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Welcome. Good to have you here, you bet. Ms. Pyper Davis, 
the executive director of Educare, Washington, D.C. The 
gentlelady is recognized for 5 minutes to deliver remarks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;EDUCARE WASHINGTON, D.C.
PYPER DAVIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, EDUCARE WASHINGTON, D.C.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  Davis. Thank you. Chairman Cole, Ranking Member 
DeLauro, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today on the critical need for all 
children, especially low-income children, to have access to 
affordable, high-quality early learning and care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;My name is Pyper Davis, and I am the executive director of 
Educare of Washington, D.C., a nonprofit just across the 
Anacostia River serving children and families living in poverty 
with a high-quality early childhood education program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;For context about me, I grew up in Michigan, earned an 
M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, and worked in the private 
sector for 15 years both on Wall Street and in the television 
industry. In 2003, I decided to leave the private sector and 
harness my business experience to work on improving education 
outcomes for low-income children. This is what brings me here 
today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Educare D.C. opened nearly 5 years ago and offers full-day, 
year-round, high-quality early childhood education services to 
children as young as 6 weeks old through age 5. The ounce of 
prevention, which includes the First Five Years Fund, opened 
the first Educare in Chicago in 2000. Today Educare D.C. is a 
part of a 21-school high-quality research-based network across 
the country, a network which includes two Educare programs in 
your home State of Oklahoma, Chairman Cole, one in Wisconsin, 
and one in California as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;All Educare schools braid together Federal Head Start and 
child care grants with State, local, and philanthropic dollars 
to create true public/private partnerships. Private funds 
account for about one-third of Educare D.C.'s funding, and the 
other two-thirds come from public funding streams that I have 
mentioned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Of the 160 children at Educare D.C., 15 percent experienced 
homelessness in the past year, and 73 percent live in a family 
with reported annual income of $9,000 or less. We know these 
risk factors can derail a child's physical, social, emotional 
and cognitive development. Without intervention, these factors 
often lead to a lack of school readiness and are linked to 
illiteracy, teen pregnancy, high dropout rates, and 
unemployment later in life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;According to Nobel Laureate economist, James Heckman, every 
dollar invested in high-quality early learning for 
disadvantaged children provides a 13 percent yearly return on 
investment. As brain science and multiple longitudinal studies 
show, investing these dollars in our youngest children is smart 
policy and smart economics.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;I would like to share just one example of success from the 
programs that you support. A few years ago, one of our teen 
moms was encouraged to enroll her infant in Educare so that she 
could finish high school. Last June, not only did mom complete 
high school, but she graduated as valedictorian, and she is now 
a full-time college student. Mom told me that she was able to 
focus on her own education because she knew that her daughter 
was safe, healthy, and learning at Educare. This is just one 
real illustration of that 13 percent return on investment, with 
two generations, both child and parent transformed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Educare is able to serve these families because of the 
funding we receive, especially from the Federal government. 
More and more Federal investments in high-quality early 
childhood education programs are being matched by governors and 
legislatures in blue and red States alike. But States and 
private investors cannot do it alone. This is hard work, and 
only by having nationally coordinated efforts and national 
talent helping to lead can we continue to make progress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;We appreciate the bipartisan support that you have shown 
these programs, and we hope that will continue as you wrap up 
Fiscal Year 2017 and work on Fiscal Year 2018, because access 
to high quality early learning programs can close the 
achievement gaps. I am requesting that the subcommittee 
continue to increase support for early childhood programs for 
Fiscal Year 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Specifically, it took bipartisan support to reauthorize the 
Child Care Development Block Grant, and it will take bipartisan 
efforts to fund the reforms that the new law requires. 
Implementing this law without reducing slots for children will 
require an increase of $1,200,000,000, and I ask that you 
increase the appropriation in line with this need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Head Start and Early Head Start are only able to serve 41 
percent of eligible 3- and 4-year-olds and 4 percent of 
eligible infants and toddlers. I urge the subcommittee to 
support funding for Head Start above current levels to ensure 
that the new outcomes-driven Head Start performance standards 
are implemented with fidelity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Additionally, I request that the subcommittee help put 
Early Head Start on a path to reach 10 percent of eligible 
children over 4 years, starting with an increase of 
$500,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2018 to expand Early Head Start and 
Early Head Start child care partnerships.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;The Every Student Succeeds Act authorizes a new preschool 
development grant program within HHS. I request that you 
provide sufficient funding to allow for new preschool 
development grant competition. These grants will improve 
collaboration and coordination at the State and local level.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Parts B and C of the IDEA make early intervention services 
available to children with disabilities. Thanks to Part B, 
753,000 children with disabilities were able to access 
necessary services in Fiscal Year 2015. I request that you 
consider increase in funding for both Part B and Part C to 
ensure that all young children with disabilities have access to 
vital services.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Access to high-quality early childhood education helps low-
income children enter kindergarten ready to learn, and offers 
entire families greater opportunities and a pathway out of 
poverty.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I extend an 
open invitation to all of you to visit Educare D.C., which is 
just down the road. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;[The information follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole [continuing]. Testimony, and I loved the 
testimony. And my one suggestion would be get one of those 
Educare centers open someplace in Connecticut, you know. It 
would probably help us a lot. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  Davis. Happy to. Happy to.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. My further suggestion, Mr. Chairman, is given 
the prospect both the chairman and I know is very real of 
serious cuts, make your voices heard loud and clear. This is an 
institution that responds, especially to something that is 
successful. But please come to Connecticut.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  Davis. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. The gentlelady, as always, is correct.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;If we could, we will have our next witness, please. 
Welcome. Good to have you here. Mr. Ted Cornelius, the 
executive director of the Tennessee State Alliance of YMCAs. 
You are recognized for 5 minutes for whatever testimony you 
care to offer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.
TED CORNELIUS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TENNESSEE STATE ALLIANCE OF YMCAS&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cornelius. Thank you. So, thank you, Chairman Cole and 
Ranking Member Fleischmann of Tennessee, and the rest of the 
members of the subcommittee. I am very thankful for the 
opportunity to talk with you today about some of the exciting 
work that the YMCA is doing.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;I am the executive director of the Tennessee State Alliance 
of YMCAs. And on behalf of the 2,700 YMCAs across the country, 
I am here to talk about some of the work that the Tennessee 
YMCAs and also YMCAs across the country are doing to prevent 
diabetes and also save millions of lives, and also save 
billions of dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, I am specifically here to ask for $25,000,000 to go 
towards the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's 
National Diabetes Prevention Program. We have supported the 
priority of Congress placing on the National Institutes of 
Health to be able to look at investing in medical 
breakthroughs. And I am here to tell you about an investment 
that the National Institute of Health made in 1996. That was a 
clinical research trial, and it actually aimed at delaying the 
onset of type 2 diabetes through weight loss and also the 
treatment with the drug Metformin. I am here to tell you that 
the outcomes were extremely successful. We showed 58 percent 
lost 5 to 7 percent weight loss, and over 60 years of age 
reduced by 71 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So immediately, Secretary Tommy Thompson called off the 
trial and urged the Nation to scale the program immediately. 
The barrier was that it was expensive, and so we were not able 
to do that. But fast forward a couple of years, the academic 
institution that was involved in the trial came to the YMCA. We 
looked at Indianapolis and the local Y's, and we were able to 
identify delivering this at a 10 to 20 percent reduction, some 
of the cost.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, with that then the United Health Group in 2010 were 
able to start paying for the program for Y's to scale. So then, 
fast forward 7 years later, we are now in 1,700 community 
sites, 47 States. 30 private insurers are covering the program. 
10 State employee programs are now covering it as well. And I 
am here to say that we are extremely confident in this program, 
and that it works, and that we operate in a pay for performance 
basis, and receive payment only when outcomes are achieved.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, I just want to emphasize that we could not do this 
without the partnership with the Centers for Disease Control. 
It is a public/private partnership that is absolutely critical 
to this work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, we urge Congress to continue to support the CDC's 
National Diabetes Prevention Program so more of the community 
organizations, like the YMCA, can go ahead and continue to 
scale this extremely important program. We do understand that 
there are challenging budget times right now. We are urging you 
to invest in taxpayer dollars where you get the most return.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;And I can tell you this has been a proven program. So 
again, we are asking for support for $25,000,000 into the CDC, 
and here is why. We are spending $322,000,000,000 annually. In 
Tennessee specifically, $6,600,000,000 is being spent on this 
disease. And then $1 out of every $3 is being spent on Medicare 
spending for the care of diabetes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, CDC absolutely needs these resources in order to build 
capacity with organizations to be able to scale this, to 
educate the 86 million that are in a pre-diabetic condition who 
sometimes do not even know that they are in a pre-diabetic 
condition. And then also to run the CDC Recognition Program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Fast forward to 2012, the YMCA of the USA had a CMMI 
Innovation Grant Award with CMS and demonstrated cost savings 
of $2,650 per Medicare patient as far as a return on 
investment, and marks the first time in history that a 
community intervention produced a cost savings from a 
prevention service. Then fast forward to November 2016, CMS 
finalized a rule enabling scale of program for Medicare with 
pre-diabetes, which really includes half of all seniors 
nationwide. So, this benefit will be available starting January 
1 of 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, for the many community organizations like the Y and the 
CDC Recognition is essential and another reason why funding the 
Center for Disease Control's Diabetes Prevention Program is so 
critically important. So, we urge Congress to support a robust 
investment in diabetes, in chronic disease prevention at the 
CDC. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Thank you for your testimony. I understand my 
friend from California, Ms. Roybal-Allard, has a question or 
comment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  Roybal-Allard. Okay. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Cornelius, thank you for highlighting a program that is 
prioritizing real proven prevention efforts in the community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;You did not mention that in your testimony, but I recall 
that the National Diabetes Prevention Program was originally 
funded by the Prevention and Public Health Fund, and the NDPP 
was given its own line item within the CDC. Since the 
Prevention and Public Health now back fills approximately 12 
percent of the CDC budget, what would be the impact for the 
NDPP if that fund is eliminated as part of repealing the ACA?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cornelius. Thank you for your question. It would be a 
great impact. So, it would be about 40 percent to the CDC's 
budget, which is extreme. And I will tell you, chronic disease 
in our country is one of the number one killers of disease, 
costs us an extreme amount of money. That is why I would say it 
is absolutely critical that we continue to keep having 
appropriations and this investment into the Centers for Disease 
Control's budget in order for us to continue to keep scaling 
this program. Thank you for your question.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. I thank the gentleman for his testimony, and we 
will certainly take it under advisement. Thank you again.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cornelius. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. If we could, next witness. Welcome, sir. It is 
good to have you here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  McPherson. Yes, sir. Nice to be here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Good.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  McPherson. Mr. Chairman----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Peter McPherson, president of the Association of 
Public and Land Grant Universities. The gentleman is recognized 
for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AND LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITIES
M. PETER MCPHERSON, PRESIDENT, ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AND LAND-GRANT&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  McPherson. Good to be here. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;My association is a group of 194 universities systems 
around the country representing the universities that are in 
every one of your States. They educate over 5 million students, 
$40,000,000,000 research. It is a large public and the land 
grants around the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;I am here to talk about Pell and about NIH funding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;A few comments about college and Pell. Since the Great 
Recession, almost all the jobs, the new jobs, were taken by 
people that had some college, and some 72 percent of those new 
jobs went to people with a 4-year degree. It is clear that 
these are very important degrees to get for our population.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;A few comments about Pell, of course. The low-income 
minority students in our country simply are not getting the 
degrees anywhere near the percent that higher-income people 
are. We certainly applaud getting something like 85 percent or 
more of the top quintile of income in this country get college 
degrees. But at the lowest quintile, it is like 8 percent, and 
it gradually moves up. Pell is just so key to make this work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;When you look at who gets the jobs, we cannot have income 
people not have some post-secondary education, and those 4-year 
degrees are very important for so many people. Certainly, they 
are competent to get them when you look at income distribution.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Well, I look at Oklahoma, for example, where Oklahoma, 
Oklahoma State, and Langston have 12,000 Pell students. 
University of Connecticut has 4,000. And I could around the 
room and give the figures for every one of the States here. 
They are doing impressive work these are public institutions, 
and we need to support them. We need to have this discretionary 
mandatory minimum. I hope you can keep it, it if not increase 
it, realizing that certainly is difficult in these days.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;We think that the yea-round Pell is just central. I know 
every one of you understand year-round Pell, and I really think 
you would love to do it. I appreciate the chairman when it was 
included in the markup last year for up 2017. You said, well, 
maybe it can be worked out in the final agreement. We hope so. 
And I appreciate the ongoing interest here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;The NIH funding is, of course, very critical, and you have 
all been so supportive of it. We hope that there can be a 
$2,000,000,000 increase for 2017. And, of course, we think that 
you need to continue to build us up. I am struck by how often I 
say to my wife, you know, when some friend is ill or has a 
problem, you know, they would not have been able to deal with 
that a few years ago. When you think about it, it is really 
true. We just sometimes forget how much medical technology has 
advanced, and so much of that is NIH founded.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;When we think about our economy, we have all had the 
benefits of this information technology that has changed our 
lives, but also changed the economy of this country. There are 
many people who think that the information technology is going 
to build and expand upon the biotech nature of this. I believe 
that in 15 years or so, the investment here is just not only 
key for the health of every one of us actually, but for the 
growth of this economy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, Mr. Chairman, the ranking minority, friends, members, I 
hope these are helpful to you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;[The information follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. I appreciate the comments very much, and I know 
you will help us. If we got the 2017 bill out, I think you 
would be very happy with some of your requests.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  McPherson. We will work hard. Our members are 
intensely interested, as you know. They are happy to chat with 
you and whatever could be helpful. And, more important, members 
beyond this table I am sure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Thank you very much for your testimony. You 
are spot on. And I would say that, as Connecticut being one of 
the oldest land grant colleges in the country. So, thanks for 
all you do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  McPherson. Well, I know it well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  McPherson. I have been up there. It is a strong 
institution. Susan is doing nice job.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Right. Thank you for your support of Pell. It 
makes a difference. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  McPherson. You bet.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Thank you very much for your testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Our next witness? I believe, Mr. Kingston? Chairman 
Kingston, are you here? Why do you not come on up to the dais 
as well?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Kingston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Well, as many of you here know, Mr. Kingston is 
the former chairman of this committee, my good friend and 
colleague. To all of us here, it is a particular pleasure to 
have you back, and I know you have got a witness that you would 
like to speak as well. But I wanted to recognize you for the 
wonderful work you did here and what a terrific friend you 
were, and allow you to make any remarks you care to make as you 
introduce the next witness.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Kingston. Well, thank the chairman for that, and the 
ranking member, and my friends on the committee. I wanted to 
say I did have an opportunity to tour the room right after you 
renovated it, and I looked up and I saw the Native American 
artwork with the Italian Renaissance influence. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;And I said to the clerk, I said, Ms. Ross, this is 
obviously the work of Mr. Cole and Ms. DeLauro. And she said, 
no, it came from the U.S. Capitol. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;But I thought, you know what? I am still right because it 
still was Italian Renaissance and Native American influence 
that helped shape that. But the room looks great, and I am glad 
to be here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;As you know, Job Corps has 50,000 grads a year. 80 percent 
of them find work. It is focused on really disadvantaged and 
sometimes troubled youth, dropouts, and so forth, and many 
times homeless people. They have trained 3 million people, and 
one of them is here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;And if the committee will indulge, Thomas Franklin, if you 
could just stand up. Let them see what a fine young man you 
are. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;And Thomas is on his way to be a railroad clerk and 
studying all things transportation, logistics, and railroad.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;But the witness who is here today that I am going to 
introduce is Susan Fallon. And rather than have somebody from 
the Job Corps to tell you how great they are, I thought it 
would be more effective to have one of their partners, a 
business, Monster, Inc., who works very closely with them in 
helping people. And, Ms. Clark, you will recognize where they 
are located as your hometown.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;And so, our witness is Susan Fallon, and I am going to 
introduce her. She is one of the vice presidents of Monster, 
Inc. But if the name rings a bell, her father, Bill Fallon, has 
been a witness. You know Admiral Fallon has testified before 
many of our committees on appropriations in the Department of 
Defense for many years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, with that, I will yield the floor.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Mr. Chairman if I might just before the 
witness comes, I thought that was you in the back row there, 
Jack, and I said maybe I am not, you know, seeing correctly. 
But former Congressman Kingston chaired and co-chaired the Ag 
Committee, and we did the same with Labor-H. And there are 
always the discussion about how people on both sides of the 
aisle cannot get along but Jack Kingston I have gotten along 
for many, many, many years whether it's on the floor of the 
House or serving in these positions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;It is great to see you here this morning, Jack.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. See, Jack, you make me feel like the second 
husband that cannot quite measure up----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. We have been through a lot of battles. We 
were each chair of the Message Committee in the early, early 
days.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Kingston. We came together over conflict.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Conflict, right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Kingston. We bonded, and we horrified both Democrats 
and Republicans with our lasting friendship.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. And now he is the star of stage, screen, and 
television. We see him all the time. Thanks, Jack.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. It is good to----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Kingston. It is great to be with you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Good to see my friend again. Ms. Fallon, if you 
would come up, we would love to have you. That was a very 
clever twofer, you know? [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;But it is a delight to have you here, and the gentlelady is 
recognized for 5 minutes to deliver her testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.
SUSAN FALLON, VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL STRATEGY AND BUSINESS&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;DEVELOPMENT, MONSTER GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  Fallon. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member 
DeLauro, members of the Subcommittee for inviting me to 
testify.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Monster is headquartered in western Massachusetts, which is 
located in the district of your subcommittee colleague, 
Congresswoman Katherine Clark. I am thrilled to see our 
hometown congresswoman here today. And, of course, thank you, 
Chairman Kingston for that kind introduction.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;I am honored to have the opportunity to speak to you on 
issues that are of critical importance not only to Monster 
Government Solutions, but also to millions of employers across 
the country. And those are the issues of jobs, our youth, and a 
skilled workforce.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, there are 5.6 
million jobs that remain unfilled because employers simply 
cannot find workers with the right set of skills. Some 
estimates show that this skills gap cost our economy 
$160,000,000 annually. These are essentially lost jobs in our 
communities that we could easily reclaim through upskilling and 
investing in workforce development.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;At the same time, there are 5.5 million young Americans 
aged 16 to 24 who are out of work and out of school. These 
youth are untapped economic assets who could potentially 
provide returns of as much as $5,000,000,000,000 dollars to our 
communities in terms of wages and activity, as well as a 
reduced dependence on taxpayer support. But these young people, 
many like Thomas, are not just a statistic. They are our 
future.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;We at Monster, like the dozens of national employers 
participating in the Hundred Thousand Opportunities Initiative, 
believe it is a critical priority for our Nation to invest in 
these young men and women. Towards that end, last year we 
worked with the Job Corps Program to launch an initiative we 
call Youth Opportunities 2020.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;As you know, Job Corps offers training in more than 100 
different high demand occupations in 125 rural and urban 
communities nationwide. In Program Year 2015, nearly 80 percent 
of students left with an industry-recognized credential. The 
result: 86 percent of graduates secured jobs or enrolled in 
higher education. The bottom line? Job Corps works.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;We have learned that small business trust Job Corps to meet 
their talent needs, which is why over 100 local chambers of 
commerce, from Connecticut to Oklahoma to Washington, have 
signed letters of support for the program. Building on this 
interest, Monster worked with Job Corps last year to launch the 
Youth Opportunities Portal, which provides students with online 
career tools and resources, and employers with the tools to be 
matched to thousands of skilled young Americans at no cost.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;For example, our data shows that last month in your 
district, Mr. Chairman, there were 15,131 job openings 
published. Last month in New Haven, Ranking Member DeLauro, 
there were more than 22,126 job openings published. Many of 
these are middle-skilled jobs that require the technical 
skills, industry-recognized certifications and training that 
our youth are receiving from the Job Corps Program. These 
include transportation and material moving occupations, which 
account for more than a quarter of the job postings in the 
chairman's district, to nursing and other healthcare related 
professions that account for the largest share of postings in 
the ranking member's district.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;We at Monster are mission driven to expand employment 
opportunities for job seekers, and to help employers find the 
skills- and work-ready employees they need to grow their 
businesses. We urge the subcommittee, which has provided 
incredible bipartisan support to Job Corps for more than 50 
years, to continue to provide sufficient funding in Fiscal Year 
2018, and help as many of these young people and the employers 
that need their skills as possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

being here today. Mr. Chairman, I am glad you noticed the 
twofer approach. That is how we roll in CD-5. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  Clark. And we are just delighted to be here, and thank 
you for making the connections. Creating jobs, allowing people 
to have that matched with good employment is the most critical 
function we can have. And thank you for your work and being

    &lt;paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Thank you very much for your testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  Fallon. Thank you, sir.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Next witness, and it is good to have my good 
friend, Robert Egge, the chief public policy officer for the 
Alzheimer's Association. In full disclosure, we have done a lot 
of work together. Appreciate his good work. And the gentleman 
is recognized for whatever testimony he cares to deliver to the 
committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION
ROBERT EGGE, CHIEF PUBLIC POLICY OFFICER, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Egge. Thank you very much. Good morning, Chairman 
Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro, and members of the Subcommittee. 
On behalf of the more than 5 million Americans living with 
Alzheimer's disease and their 15 million caregivers, thank you 
for the opportunity to testify before you today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;I would like to begin by thanking you for the extremely 
important leadership the subcommittee demonstrated in 
addressing Alzheimer's during the 114th Congress. You were 
integral to delivering a much-needed historic increase in 
Alzheimer's funding in Fiscal Year 2016. And for Fiscal Year 
2017, you completed the work to do so again. On that note, we 
ask you to continue to pursue this very important Alzheimer's 
research funding over the coming 2 months.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;The Alzheimer's community is very grateful for your work. 
You have given new hope to Americans that the realities that 
define this disease today can and will change in the years 
ahead. As you are well aware, however, today the realities that 
define this disease remain grim.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Alzheimer's is a terminal disease with no survivors. Recent 
failures of high-profile Alzheimer's trials underscore that 
Alzheimer's retains the unacceptable distinction of being the 
only one of the top 10 causes of death in America without a way 
to cure, prevent, or even slow progression. It should be no 
surprise then that Alzheimer's has become a top priority of 
Americans. In fact, those middle-aged and older identify 
Alzheimer's by a significant margin as the disease they fear 
most.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Alzheimer's is also very costly. Another regrettable 
distinction held by Alzheimer's is that according to the NIH 
funded study conducted by Rand economists and published in The 
New England Journal of Medicine, Alzheimer's has grown to 
become the most expensive disease in America. More than two-
thirds of this cost is paid for by Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;As if all this were not enough to justify an urgent 
response, America's Alzheimer's crisis is set to grow much 
worse in the years ahead. Because Alzheimer's is predominately 
a disease associated with aging and America is predominantly an 
aging society, these numbers will skyrocket between now and 
2050. By 2050, those with Alzheimer's will as much as triple, 
and the associated costs will quadruple to $1,100,000,000,000 
per year, unless, that is, we can change the trajectory through 
the development of effective treatments and a means of 
prevention.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;These facts underscore that America urgently needs this 
subcommittee's continued decisive leadership. But all these 
facts make only half a case. We understand that you not only 
must ensure that you direct limited resources to where the 
needs are great, but also to where the opportunities are great.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;What is more, you need to decide not just whether funds are 
warranted, but how much funding is warranted. These are 
important and difficult questions to answer. Fortunately, in 
the case of Alzheimer's specifically, Congress has put in place 
a policy framework that has provided you with this exact 
information for Fiscal Year 2018, and we urge you to rely on 
it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;In 2011, the bipartisan National Alzheimer's Project Act 
became law, requiring the creation of a comprehensive national 
Alzheimer's plan. The U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services released this plan in 2012, containing the lead goal 
to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Then in 2014, Congress enacted the Alzheimer's 
Accountability Act. This Act requires the National Institutes 
of Health prepare for Congress and the President an annual 
professional judgment budget, sometimes called a bypass budget. 
In this bypass budget for Fiscal Year 2018, NIH director, 
Francis Collins, has stated that the NIH will require 
additional $414,000,0000 in funding to remain on track to 
achieve the plan's 2025 goal. The NIH has done excellent work 
carefully detailing a plan-based budget to decisively address 
this disease. We ask you to fund this plan for the coming 
Fiscal Year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;When coupled with the facts about the burden of this 
disease that I outlined earlier, we believe that together those 
arresting facts and this thorough NIH budget do make for a 
complete and compelling case for this subcommittee to stay the 
course, a course that has every potential to change the future 
of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;In sum, on behalf of the Alzheimer's Association and our 
sister organization, the Alzheimer's Impact Movement, we 
commend Congress for creating a process that has equipped this 
subcommittee in an unusually thorough way to answer the 
question of what to provide for Alzheimer's research in Fiscal 
Year 2018. Following this process, NIH scientists have 
indicated to you that they require an increase of $414,000,0000 
in Alzheimer's research funding for the coming year. The 
Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Impact Movement are 
pleased to adopt this determination by the NIH as our request 
for this subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;[The information follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Thank you. I thank the gentleman very much for 
his testimony, and reiterate two points that he made that I 
suspect my good friend from Connecticut would also agree with. 
The first one is we do need to finish up the 2017 bill. And I 
am very worried that the temptation when we hit the deadline on 
April 28th will be to simply continue a CR. If that happens, we 
will lose the opportunity for a significant boost in funding 
for NIH in general, Alzheimer's in particular.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, I know you are working hard on this, and so, I do not 
need to urge you to do it, but I want to thank you for doing 
it. And this is a really critical thing. We are thinking a lot 
about 2018, but we need to literally get the work done because 
both the Senate and the House have agreed to prioritize both 
the NIH and Alzheimer's funding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, if we do not get the 2017 bill and we CR, we will spend 
exactly the same amount of money. It just will not go to the 
NIH and Alzheimer's. So, this is something we need to work on 
together. And, again, I know what my friend has been a tireless 
advocate on this as well on her side of the aisle.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;The second thing is, the 2018 budget, as my friend would 
point out, and I will agree with her again, only happens if we 
have, you know, an appropriate allocation level. And, you know, 
I am all in favor of the defense buildup. I am not critical of 
that at all. I think it needs to happen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;But this is not the place to fund it in my view because, 
you know, I did not think it was particularly good policy when 
President Obama argued that if defense goes up, domestic has to 
go up exactly the same amount. It is just as bad to say if 
defense goes up, domestic spending has to go down exactly. We 
should evaluate each of them independently in my viewpoint, 
sort of break that chain.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;But, again, I thank my friend for making a good case not 
only for the particular cause, but for the larger case of just 
the general allocation this committee receives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Does my friend from Connecticut care to----&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Well, I think this is an institution that has 
a lot of very well-meaning people on both sides of the aisle to 
do things, but it really moves when there is external pressure. 
I will say this to everybody in the audience. You are the 
external pressure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;And, you know, I think Chairman is right. We would do well 
if we did 2017. There would be an increase, and then we are 
both very concerned about 2018 and what this might mean. And it 
would be, to say the least, devastating to your interests and 
others here as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;So, you need to go back to your groups and associations, 
people who hear from you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Egge. We will do so.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Again, appreciate the gentleman's testimony. And 
with that, we will move to the next witness.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Welcome. It is good to have you here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Longmire. Good to be here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Mr. Joseph Longmire. He is a student with the 
Council for Opportunity in Education, better known around here 
as TRIO. There is no cause that has probably been more 
bipartisan on this committee than that. We have worked hard on 
this program, and we appreciate you very much being here to 
testify.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Ms. Siefring"&gt;The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

JOSEPH LONGMIRE, JR., STUDENT, COUNCIL FOR OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Longmire&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;I want to start by thanking Chairman Cole and
all of the members of the subcommittee for the opportunity to 
be here today to discuss TRIO. I would be remiss if I did not 
also acknowledge my congresswoman, Representative Martha Roby, 
and express my thanks for her support.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;I am a witness to the fact that TRIO is making a huge 
difference in shaping the future of students like me across the 
2nd District of Alabama. TRIO has led so many firsts for me, 
including this visit to Washington, D.C., which marks my first 
experience flying on an airplane and my first time visiting the 
Nation's Capital.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;I grew up in Greenville, Alabama as the oldest of four 
children ranging from ages 8 to 20. My parents have always 
worked extremely hard to provide for my siblings and me. My 
father maintains several jobs, including full time as an order 
filler at the Walmart Mart Distribution Center, as well as a 
barber, mechanic, and handyman. My mother works at a childcare 
center. My parents always encourage my siblings and me to 
achieve as much education as possible.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;Despite their enduring love and support, I had to look 
beyond my immediate family for help in pursuing my higher 
education goals. This is where TRIO stepped in and became like 
another family for me.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;In order to save money, I decided to begin my college 
career at Lurleen B. Wallace Community College. During my early 
days as a student there, I met with the counseling services 
provided by the college, but found that I needed more 
consistent and personalized support. Thankfully, I stumbled 
upon a flyer inviting students to come to an orientation for 
the TRIO Student Support Services Program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;I did not realize it at the time, but that first meeting 
was my welcome to an educational family that would push me to 
excel. My first year in TRIO was amazing. The director, staff, 
and fellow students consistently proved to be reliable sources 
for help. TRIO's tutoring services were especially critical. 
Even though they performed well academically in high school, I 
struggled with several of my college courses and, at times, 
fear that I would receive failing grades. This was especially 
true of my English class. However, because of the academic 
assistance provided by TRIO, I not only passed these classes, 
but I also earned a few A's along the way.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;As my graduation from community college approached, I found 
myself frustrated about what I wanted to do next. While I knew 
I wanted to be an occupational therapist, I did not know how to 
get there. Once again, it was my TRIO family that helped me 
find my way. The program director and the staff helped me 
navigate the complicated process of transferring to a 4-year 
institution. From deciding where to go to waiving my 
application fees, they were there every step of the way. 
Without their help. I would have found myself among the 72 
percentage of low-income first generation community college 
students who failed to transfer without additional support.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;Nationally, TRIO Student Support Services participants 
chance or at a rate that is 46 percent higher. Thanks to the 
assistance of the TRIO Program at Lurleen B. Wallace Community 
College, last fall I enrolled as a junior at Alabama State 
University where I majored in health rehabilitation. The change 
to a 4-year institution has been dramatic. Coming into a 
situation where I did not know anyone, I felt like a guppy in a 
huge ocean of fish.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;On my first day of classes, I found the TRIO office, and I 
felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I knew that I 
had found my life support for the rest of my college career.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;Today, the TRIO Program at Alabama State continues to give 
me the academic and social support I need in order to succeed. 
This support system has been extremely critical for me as I 
must juggle both my studies and my finances. In addition to 
benefiting from TRIO, I am also a Pell Grant recipient. 
However, financial aid alone does not fully meet my needs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;So, my course load as a student, I work 30 hours a week as 
an office clerk at Super Foods Grocery Store and as a 
merchandiser for a magazine retailer. While my schedule can be 
overwhelming at times, I know that these years of struggle and 
sacrifice will be worth it. When I graduate, I will be the 
first person in my family to earn a bachelor's degree. However, 
I know with certainty that I will not be the last.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;Because TRIO played such a big role in my college life, I 
made sure that my younger brother, who is now a freshman at 
Lurleen B. Wallace, also got involved with the TRIO Program on 
campus. I can truly say that becoming part of TRIO is one of 
the best decisions that I have made while attending college.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;I would enthusiastically recommend participation in TRIO to 
every college student. It can truly be the difference between 
failing or passing classes, dropping out or persevering to see 
another semester, succumbing to overwhelming pressures or 
learning to thrive amidst adversity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;I hope this subcommittee will do everything possible to 
increase funding for TRIO so that more students like me will 
have the opportunity to achieve their college dreams.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;Thank you again for the opportunity to testify here today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Longmire"&gt;[Applause.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;We want to thank the gentleman for his testimony,
welcome him to Washington for his first trip up here. I 
certainly hope it is not his last. And just make the point, 
which I know this committee knows well, but since its 
inception, TRIO has produced over 5 million college graduates. 
And I would suggest that is one terrific investment for the 
United States of America to have made because I can assure you, 
those 5 million grads have paid a lot more taxes than we have 
ever spent on Trio.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;    This is a program that has a great return for us. Thank you 
for offering such compelling personal testimony for the 
difference it has made in your life, and through you and your 
family's life. It is a very powerful reinforcement for a very 
important program.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;I would just say thank you very, very much,
Joseph. What you do is to provide for us and for everyone here 
the veracity that the Federal government has a role in people's 
lives, that it can create, help to create opportunity. And that 
is why this institution of the United States Congress exists. 
And we need to continue to provide opportunity so that we can 
have just remarkable young men like yourself, who will work 
hard not only for yourself, but for your family as well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;    Our congratulations to you, and thank you for being such a 
great role model. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Thank you very much. The gentleman is excused. If
we could have our next witness.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

caregiver, speaking on behalf of the Older Americans Act. The 
gentlelady is recognized for 5 minutes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;                                          Wednesday, March 8, 2017.
AUTUMN CAMPBELL, FORMER CAREGIVER, ON BEHALF OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Campbell&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Great. Thank you, Chairman Cole, Ranking
Member DeLauro, and members of the committee. My name is Autumn 
Campbell, and I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to discuss 
my support for the Older Americans Act.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;I am here today to share my experience as a caregiver for 
my mother and the importance of OAA services in helping me keep 
her at home. However, I should note that my caregiving 
experience also deepened the passion for aging issues, and I 
currently work for the National Association of Area Agencies on 
Aging, on behalf of local aging agencies that coordinate and 
deliver OAA programs across the country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;So, I always knew that at some point I was going to take 
care of my mom. I am an only child, and she was a single parent 
for most of my life. As she approached her 60s on a teacher's 
salary, I knew that she did not have the financial resources to 
live out her retirement independently, and that I would 
eventually have to meet her care needs. However, I never 
thought that would come when I was 32.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Unfortunately, shortly after my mom turned 60, she 
developed a quickly progressing and devastating 
neurodegenerative disorder that robbed her of her physical and 
cognitive capacities. This diagnosis also sent me scrambling to 
figure out how to take care of her. After moving her in with me 
and securing Social Security Disability support, I knew that I 
was ultimately facing a choice of quitting my job to care for 
her or putting her in institutional care under Medicaid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;I called on the local area Agency on Aging, funded in part 
through the Older Americans Act, and they connected me to a 
number of services that helped me keep my mom at home and 
allowed me to continue working full time. For example, 3 days a 
week I dropped my mom off at an adult daycare center where I 
knew she would be loved, fed, entertained, and cared for while 
I went to work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;The local Aging Agency also provided caregiver respite when 
I desperately needed a break. When my mom's needs became too 
severe to take her to adult daycare, the Aging Agency helped me 
navigate the complicated world of Medicaid, and the local 
ombudsman office, also funded by the Older Americans Act, 
ensured that her application for a Medicaid home and community-
based services waiver was shepherded through the cumbersome 
approval process so that she was not facing institutional 
placement. I could not have navigated my caregiver role without 
Older Americans Act services and the local aging agency. There 
is no doubt that without them I would have left the workforce 
to care for my mom or put her in institutional care funded by 
Medicaid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;My mom passed away in late 2015, but I am forever grateful 
that I was able to be there for her when she needed me, and 
that OAA programs made this possible. But my story is just one 
of millions about how critical Federal Older Americans Act 
programs are to seniors and caregivers. These essential 
programs help us as a country keep our promises to previous 
generations and care for the people who cared for us.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;OAA is the cornerstone of the Nation's non-Medicaid Home 
and Community-Based Services System. There are dozens of OAA-
funded services that enable seniors to age at home and in the 
community, and a few examples that show the range of the help 
that OAA provides are: in-home care to help with bathing and 
dressing; home delivered meals and congregate meals that 
prevent malnutrition and social isolation; transportation such 
as rides the doctor or the grocery store, information or 
referral assistance; case management and care coordination 
assistance; adult day care to relieve family caregivers; legal 
services to prevent abuse and exploitation; and support and 
training for often overwhelmed family caregivers such as 
myself.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;These services are in high demand nationally, but they have 
very limited Federal resources. Meanwhile, we're facing an 
unprecedented demographic shift as the Nation's baby boomers 
age at a historic pace. Every day 10,000 people turn 65, and by 
2030, 73 million people, or 1 in 5 Americans, will be 65 or 
older.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;For years, funding for Older Americans Act programs has not 
kept pace with annual inflation, let alone a growing need. This 
rapid erosion of funding coupled with this growing need has 
made it increasingly difficult, or even impossible, for local 
agencies to even maintain existing services. As a result, local 
waiting lists are long and they are growing longer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;This dire situation only intensifies the need for Federal 
investment, especially considering that OAA programs help 
offset future mandatory spending. When seniors are healthier, 
Medicare saves money. When frail older adults get the in-home 
services and support that prevent or delay nursing home 
admission, Medicaid saves money. Why would we not invest in 
flexible, targeted, cost-effective, person-centered care on the 
front end to avoid greater longer-term costs among a growing 
population?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;So, I urge appropriators to carry out the promise that your 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle made last year by 
reauthorizing OAA, and ensure that OAA programs are protected 
from brutal funding cuts. Specifically, I ask that you focus on 
restoring funding to critical programs, such as OAA Title 3(b), 
Supportive Services, and Title 3(e), National Family Caregiver 
Support Program, which have had little to no relief from 
previous cuts despite recent budget deals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;So, on behalf of the millions of older Americans and their 
caregivers in every community, on behalf of the hundreds of 
local agencies coordinating and delivering services, on behalf 
of one daughter trying to do her best to care for her mother, I 
urge you to protect investments in the Older Americans Act that 
are in the best interests of a rapidly aging population and our 
fiscal health as a country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.
VICTORIA KITCHYAN, GREAT PLAINS AREA BOARD REPRESENTATIVE, NATIONAL&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Ms.  Kitchyan. Good morning, Chairman Cole, Ranking Member 
DeLauro, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you. On behalf 
the National Indian Health Board, thank you for allowing me to 
testify on the Fiscal Year 2018 Health and Human Services 
budget. My name is Victoria Kitchyan, and I am a member of the 
Winnebago Tribe in Nebraska, and I am also a tribal council 
member. I serve as Treasurer.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;First, I would like to thank the subcommittee for the great 
work that it has done to increase the profile of American 
Indian and Alaska Natives health issues over the last several 
years. Your commitment to these issues has been enormously 
helpful to the tribes, and it has allowed us to work directly 
with the agencies and have some of these hard discussions. So, 
we thank you for that.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;As you are aware, a Federal promise was to provide Indian 
Health Service was made long ago. Our ancestors entered into 
these treaties and agreements, and part of these treatment 
agreements were to provide health service in exchange for 
tribal land and peace. The land and peace was given by the 
Federal government has yet to live up to its trust 
responsibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Our people live sicker. We die younger, on average, 4.5 
five years earlier, and, in some States, up to 20 years 
younger. So, the time has long since passed to address some of 
these shortcomings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Though the Indian Health Service continues to serve as the 
primary health provider for American Indians and Alaska 
Natives, funding for that Agency has always been far below the 
need. Additionally, IHS was never designed to be a public 
health system; rather, direct primary care. So, agencies like 
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Administration, and Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services, all play a crucial and critical 
role in this trust responsibility, and should offer a 
complementary role to Indian Health Service to uphold that 
trust responsibility.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Public health infrastructure in Indian country is one of 
the most severely underfunded and underdeveloped areas. Like 
States and territorial governments, tribes have both the rights 
and responsibilities to offer vital public health services for 
the communities. Currently tribes are regularly left out of 
these opportunities. State-run health programs simultaneously 
were left and overlooked at the Federal level when agencies 
have opportunities. So, these health initiatives are needed and 
not funded or overlooked.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;One example of this in my tribe is with the Community 
Health Representative Training Program. We are very thankful to 
have that opportunity and to have that funding, but the program 
is driven by the State of Nebraska. It is not tribal 
priorities. So, the grant supports one position where in our 
community we know that cohorts are more successful. Cohorts 
work better, yet we have one position. So, the tribe and other 
tribal have to supplement that where they can and if they can 
to be successful and increase those positions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;So essentially, we are trying to fit into someone else's 
program, and it is just not working for Indian Country. So 
rather, we would like programs to be designed for the tribe. 
Government should respond to the local needs, and this means 
empowering tribes to have the ability to make their own funding 
decisions on programs like this CHR one I am talking about.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;One way we could do this and help support public health 
infrastructure is supporting direct funding from CDC. NIHB 
requests on behalf of all tribes that in Fiscal Year 2018 
Congress create base funding for tribal communities through the 
Public Health and Health Service Block Grant by allocating at 
least 5 percent directly to tribes. This will enable the public 
health systems in Indian Country to develop consistent, 
sustainable healthcare infrastructure dollars that are driven 
by the tribal interests and the tribal parties, and what 
communities know best are their needs, and not so much an 
opportunity that we try to navigate through, and fit into, just 
for funding purposes. It does not work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;So, it is well time that tribal communities catch up to 
other Americans when it is the expectation of public health. 
Nowhere is the lack of solid infrastructure and support more 
acute than when it comes to the Mental and Behavioral Health 
Service. American Indians and Alaska Natives grapple with 
complex behavioral health issues. Restructured Federal policy 
through the years, changing political climate, unresponsive or 
harmful human services systems have created unresolved 
historical trauma, intergenerational trauma.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;These wounds created by kill the Indian, save the man, 
these things have left scars, and without the proper resources 
or flexibility to design the programs that we need, we are just 
going to continue to perpetuate this problem and never achieve 
healthier outcomes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Tribes request that automatic direct funding go to the 
Mental Health Service Grant and the Substance Abuse Grant. At 
the very minimum, we would like statutory requirements that 
would require the States to consult with the tribes, and also 
show how that is going to roll out and benefit our communities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;We also request they give priority to Circles of Care 
Program and tribal behavioral health programs. These are some 
of the only ones that are going to tribes, so we would also 
like to protect those and ensure that those continue.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;And last but not least, I would like to touch on CMS and 
the over 40 years the acknowledgment to support tribes with 
CMS, within CMS. So, we need to authorize Medicaid 
reimbursement at IHs and the tribally-operated facilities, and 
to help these facilities continue to provide that 100 FMAP 
where available. And we are pleased to see that this week the 
House healthcare reform legislation included that, so we 
appreciate that, and we look forward to, you know, those 
continue discussions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;However, with Medicaid given more authority, we also want 
to ensure that the committee has oversight over CMS so that any 
of the applications submitted, waivers are consulted with the 
tribes, and that any of the barriers, like, work, life, time 
limits, or work requirements do not affect the American Indians 
and Alaska Natives, because these barriers only force a bigger 
burden on the Indian Health Service that I also said was 
underfunded.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;So, in conclusion I would just like to reiterate our 
appreciation for the bipartisan commitment. Chairman Cole is 
very active in our issues. And I just want to say that the 
National Indian Health Board believes that with a few dedicated 
resources and a few targeted investments, we can begin to 
address this persistent disparity that is prevalent in Indian 
Country.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;[The information follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Mr.  Cole. I want to thank the gentlelady for her 
testimony. As she knows, this is something I care very deeply 
about, and we have made significant progress on. But we are so 
far behind that we could make progress for a lot of years and 
not catch up.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;You know, the direct funding, even though it is 
administered by HHS, comes out of the Interior Subcommittee for 
many of these programs, a great majority, Indian Health Service 
in particular, and they have exactly the same challenge we do. 
If we have the kind of allocation for non-defense 
discretionary, they are going to face the same sort of pressure 
in the Interior Committee where I sit as a member. And Chairman 
Calvert, who has been very supportive of these issues is there, 
and our ranking member, Betty McCollum, also is very 
supportive.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;So, your testimony is very timely. The problems are 
terrific. We made a little progress, not enough. And I would 
say it is at risk if we do not do the right thing. So, I 
appreciate the gentlelady's work. I certainly appreciate my 
friends at the Indian Health Board, including my former 
staffer, Catrons, back there who worked for me and has gone on 
to bigger and greater things, but has continued to advance 
important issues in an effective way. With that, I would 
recognize my friend.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank 
you so much for your testimony. And the chairman, this is an 
issue that is near and dear to his heart, and I think you know 
that. But there is also bipartisan support for these efforts.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;And I think one of the other areas that you need to take a 
hard look at is, and I do not know the numbers and I would like 
to know the numbers, of folks who are dependent on Medicaid in 
the community, because I think there is going to be a serious 
challenge with regard to Medicaid as we see with, at least the 
early stage of the healthcare proposal, both to the Medicaid 
Expansion Program, but overall to Medicaid. And if we are not 
careful in that regard, if you are going to shift those funds 
or those responsibilities to our States, and I know that people 
talk about the flexibility of States, but oftentimes what the 
results can be is a rationing of care with regard to this 
effort.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;And so, I think we have to be very, very careful in looking 
at that. And I know you will do that because the need is so 
great in the community that you represent. And we should not go 
back on some of the gains that have been made, but only try to 
move forward.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;So, thank you for your commitment. Appreciate it.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Again, thank you for your testimony. The next 
witness please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Hi. It is great to have you here. This is Jazmin Goodwin, a 
GEAR UP alumni and Howard University student, National Council 
for Community and Education Partnership. The gentlelady is 
welcome and is recognized for 5 minutes to deliver whatever 
testimony she cares to give to the committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.
JAZMIN GOODWIN, GEAR UP ALUMNUS AND HOWARD UNIVERSITY STUDENT, NATIONAL&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Mr.  Goodwin. Chairman Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro, and 
distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for 
inviting me to testify on the Gaining Early Awareness and 
Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, or GEAR UP Initiative. I 
am honored to be able to share how GEAR UP transformed my life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;GEAR UP is a competitive grant program administered by the 
U.S. Department of Education that serves 635,000 students 2,800 
low-income schools across 46 States. GEAR UP empowers local and 
State leaders from K-12, higher education, and community 
organizations to develop partnerships to increase the number of 
low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in 
higher education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;In a nutshell GEAR UP provides students with academic 
interventions, supports families along the complex path to 
college and career, and builds the capacity of schools to 
strengthen the quality of instruction and counseling.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;GEAR UP begins early in the 7th grade, then follows entire 
classes of students through high school graduation and often 
through the first year of post-secondary education. Most 
importantly, the GEAR UP is succeeding. 77.3 percent of the 
GEAR UP class of 2014 enrolled in a post-secondary immediately 
following high school graduation, a rate nearly 32 percentage 
points higher than low-income students nationally.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;My parents were in the U.S. Army. I was born on a base in 
Germany, and my family eventually settled at Fort Jackson in 
Columbia, South Carolina. My mother and grandmother valued 
education, and they made it clear that an education beyond high 
school was critical. My mom even went back to school while 
raising me and working full time, becoming the first in our 
family to earn a college degree.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Yet, in school not everyone was perceived as college 
material, myself included. I struggled to find my footing in 
middle school and had a very low GPA in 9th grade. The idea of 
higher education seemed out of reach. Yet the GEAR UP staff 
helped change the culture of our schools. They helped me 
discover my talents and interests, challenged me to reach for 
goals I would not have thought possible, and provided me with 
tutoring, mentoring, and support to help me and my family make 
my goals a reality.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Looking back, GEAR UP changed my trajectory. In the 10th 
grade, my future came into focus when I met admissions officers 
from Howard University through GEAR UP. I made my mind up that 
Howard was my goal, but my path there was not a clear one. Were 
it not for that in-school, after school, and summer programs 
that GEAR UP offered, I likely would not have had the academic 
qualifications to be admitted or to even know how to finance my 
education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;With GEAR UP, I turned my grades around and made it to 
Howard University where I applied my GEAR UP mindset to pursue 
every opportunity I can. I have earned $31,000 in academic 
scholarships this year, and I am planning on attending law 
school following my graduation in 2018. I remain active in the 
GEAR UP community and met GEAR UP alumni from nearly all the 
States represented by this distinguished committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;I have learned that my story is not the exception. GEAR UP 
is improving outcomes in rural and urban communities alike. 
GEAR UP truly works everywhere.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;As students, we frequently hear from policymakers that we 
need to prepare more young people for the complex skills and 
knowledge required by employers. We know that this requires 
education beyond high school, and, frankly, we are ready to 
rise to the challenge. GEAR UP is closing the opportunity, 
preparation, and attainment gap. At an annual investment of 
$505 per student served, GEAR UP pays huge dividends.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;I urge the subcommittee to consider a modest increase for 
GEAR UP to $350,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2018. This will bring 
54,000 new students into the program, continue transforming the 
lives of students and families, and help ensure that our great 
Nation is better prepared for the demands of tomorrow.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you this 
morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;[The information follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Well, I want to begin by thanking you. Judging 
from your testimony, you are going to be a pretty formidable 
lawyer someday. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;It is great to have you here. This is a program where we 
did in 2016 increase the investment, and if we can get that 
2017 bill, there will be another increased investment. And 
then, obviously 2018 depends on the overall allocation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;But you are exactly right. I have seen this program in 
action. It is very heavily involved in my State, and has 
delivered tremendous gains for students, frankly, that absent 
this would not have had the preparation, the opportunity to 
pursue a degree. So, again it is a wonderful, wonderful 
program, and you are a terrific example of the kind of people 
that come out of this program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;So, the committee very much appreciates your testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. I would just say what he said to Joseph, Mr. 
Chairman. You know, some days we wonder what we do here. I am 
serious. And the TRIO Program and the GEAR UP Program really 
allow for people to realize their dreams. So, that is a noble 
goal of the Federal government to help to realize people's 
dreams.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Thanks for being here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Mr.  Cole. And speaking only for myself, I wonder what I am 
doing here every day. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;It is not just some days. But, again, thank you very much 
for your testimony.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Our next witness, please. Thank you very much. Good to have 
you here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Mr.  Webb. Good morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Mr.  Cole. You bet. This is Mr. Edwin Webb, the associate 
executive director of the American College of Clinical 
Pharmacy. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes to deliver 
whatever testimony he cares to the committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

C. EDWIN WEBB, ASSOCIATE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN COLLEGE OF&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Mr.  Webb. Thank you, Chairman Cole, Ranking Member 
DeLauro, members of the Subcommittee for this opportunity to 
address the subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;In my statement and written testimony, we urge your 
continued support of funding for the Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality. In addition, I wanted to discuss briefly 
how the comprehensive medication management services of the 
Nation's clinical pharmacists will help Federal healthcare 
programs, such as Medicare and others, deliver better value and 
quality for patients and for our healthcare system. These, of 
course, are goals that we all share.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;ACCP is the professional society for the Nation's leading 
clinical pharmacists. We are the professional home for clinical 
pharmacy practitioners, residents, scientists, and others 
practicing in more than 60 countries. Like our members, we are 
committed to excellence in clinical pharmacy practice and 
patient pharmacotherapy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Unlike pharmacists with which you are likely most familiar, 
clinical pharmacists generally do not engage in the dispensing 
of medications. While the safe and efficient distribution of 
medications is an important component of pharmacy practice, 
clinical pharmacists' practice commonly occurs directly with 
physicians and other health professionals on the patient's 
healthcare team to ensure that the medications prescribed for 
those patients actually achieve the best possible clinical 
outcomes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;To prepare for this practice, clinical pharmacists are 
educated and trained in team-based direct patient care 
environments. They are frequently granted patient care 
privileges by collaborating physicians and health systems. 
These privileges allow them to perform a full range of 
medication decision making functions and management functions 
for their patients. These privileges are granted on the basis 
of demonstrated knowledge of medication therapy and clinical 
experience gained through post-graduate residency training and 
specialist board certification, both of which are expected in 
addition to standard training for pharmacist licensure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;An important word about the Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality. ACCP strongly supports the mission and goals of 
AHRQ. We urge the subcommittee to protect the AHRQ budget by 
providing at least $334,000,000 in budget authority consistent 
at least with current Fiscal Year levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;AHRQ is the only Federal agency with the sole purpose of 
evaluating and disseminating research that determines how to 
make care as effective, efficient, and affordable as possible. 
The work of AHRQ is vital to the work of clinical pharmacists 
and their colleagues, in hospitals, clinical practices, and 
other health care delivery settings.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Our members are dedicated to helping transform healthcare 
delivery in America by adopting patient-centered, collaborative 
healthcare approaches that deliver better care, smarter 
spending, and healthier people. AHRQ supports research and 
communication programs that help reinforce the value of that 
approach. Therefore, we urge you to support AHRQ and its 
mission through adequate funding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;As this subcommittee and all of Congress consider ways to 
strengthen and improve the Nation's healthcare system, ACCP 
also urges support for comprehensive medication management 
services. It is practiced by clinical pharmacists as members of 
inter-professional teams. It is a collaborative process that 
helps ensure that all medications taken by the patient are 
effectively coordinated, achieve their intended clinical goals, 
and improve patient outcomes. In short, CMM helps get the 
medications right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Top healthcare experts recognize CMM as a significant 
advance in quality of care. It is fully supported by the 
Patient-Center Primary Care Collaborative. It is emerging as a 
standard of care for integrated private sector health systems, 
like the Cleveland Clinic, Geisinger Health System, Kaiser 
Permanente, and others. And it is also recognized within 
important Federal programs, such as the Public Health Service, 
State Medicaid programs, and the VA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;It can be effectively operationalized under collaborative 
drug therapy management agreements that have been duly 
authorized in 49 States, or through credentialing and 
privileging systems established by individual health systems.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;We believe that coverage for CMM and Medicare is a key part 
of helping move all of healthcare to a more value-based, 
collaborative, and efficient system. We fully understand that 
the Medicare statutes are not within the subcommittee's 
specific jurisdiction, but we know that you are vitally 
interested as a committee and a subcommittee on efficiency and 
value in our Federal healthcare programs. We, therefore, urge 
your support for the dialogue that is beginning two floors down 
today and going forward to advance this notion of quality of 
care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Congress has focused many years on addressing problems 
associated with suboptimal and inefficient medication use. We 
believe the time is opportune to truly help patients get their 
medications right by making sure that team-based and patient-
centered care around their medications is part of the care that 
they are being offered.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Thank you so much for this opportunity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;THE HENRY J. KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION
SAMANTHA ARTIGA, DIRECTOR, DISPARITIES PROJECT, THE HENRY J. KAISER&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Ms.  Artiga. Chairman Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro, thank 
you so much for having me here and for the opportunity to 
testify.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;The Kaiser Family Foundation is a nonprofit health policy 
organization, so I am not taking the advocacy position or 
requesting any specific funding. But I did want to use this as 
an opportunity to emphasize the importance of continuing to 
support efforts to address health and healthcare disparities in 
our Nation. This is a particularly important and timely issue 
to address given the transformation of healthcare in recent 
years under the Affordable Care Act and the changes being 
considered to healthcare right now by this Congress.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Health and healthcare disparities are differences between 
groups in their health status and their ability to obtain the 
medical care that they need, which are rooted in historic 
economic, social, and racial disadvantages. Addressing 
disparities is not only important from a social justice 
standpoint, but also for improving our overall Nation's health, 
and for reducing unnecessary healthcare costs. With the 
projections estimating that we will be a majority/minority 
nation by 2044, it is increasingly important that we address 
these disparities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Today many groups face disparities. People of color and low 
income individuals face more barriers to obtaining the care 
they need and experience poor health outcomes compared to 
whites and those with higher incomes. As an example, blacks 
have higher rates of chronic disease, like asthma and diabetes, 
and their infant mortality rate is more than twice as high as 
the rate for whites. Although disparities are often viewed 
through the lenses of race and income, they also occur across 
other dimensions, including language, location, and sexual 
orientation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;In recent years, there have been advancements in reducing 
disparities that reflect an increased Federal focus on 
disparities as well as provisions within the Affordable Care 
Act. Specifically, ACA investments through discretionary 
programs to support public health and prevention services and 
enhance the healthcare workforce and delivery system supported 
reduction of disparities. For example, the ACA boosted funding 
for community health centers, included initiatives to increase 
the number of providers, and created the Prevention and Public 
Health Fund, which I believe was already mentioned this 
morning.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;In addition, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid and 
marketplace health coverage expansions led to large gains in 
health insurance among low-income individuals and people of 
color which helped to narrow the longstanding disparities they 
face in health coverage. If maintained, coverage gains will 
help reduce disparities in access to care as well as health 
outcomes over the longer term.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Despite this progress, challenges remain. Differing state 
decisions to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion to low-income 
adults widen geographic disparities in coverage. States that 
have expanded have experienced larger gains in coverage and 
more improved access to care than the States that have not. And 
those States that have not expanded are largely concentrated in 
the South, a region home to many people of color that has high 
rates of chronic disease and poor health.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Moreover, although disparities in coverage by race and 
income have narrowed, low-income people and people of color 
remain significantly more likely to be uninsured, and these 
disparities persist among our Nation's children. For example, 
Hispanic children are twice as likely as white children to be 
uninsured, and the uninsured rate among American Indian and 
Alaskan Native children is nearly 5 times as high as the rate 
for white children.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;As we look forward, there is much at stake for health and 
healthcare disparities as this Congress considers future 
funding decisions and broader healthcare reforms. The newly 
released American Health Care Act would likely erode recent 
progress and have significant negative effects on disparities. 
The changes to Medicaid would disproportionately affect people 
of color and low-income people for whom the program is a 
central source of coverage. Notably, more than half of all our 
Nation's children of color rely on Medicaid.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Its proposal to cap Federal Medicaid financing would lead 
to a fundamental shift in the Federal commitment to States to 
support care for individuals with the greatest health needs and 
lowest incomes. The cap would limit growth to a pre-set amount, 
and if State costs exceed capped amounts, they would need to 
increase State spending or make program cutbacks. Capped 
funding would also lock in historic differences across States 
and benefits and spending. Moreover, the elimination of the 
enhanced Federal funding for the expansion would likely result 
in eligibility reductions and losses in coverage that would 
disproportionately affect low-income people on people of color.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Reductions in health coverage would also increase strains 
on other parts of the healthcare system, including community 
health centers and public health programs. However, the act 
would also eliminate funding for the Prevention and Public 
Health Fund, which several governors have cited as a key 
component to support their public health and prevention 
activities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Amid this uncertainty to changes in health insurance, 
coverage support for public health and prevention services, and 
a healthcare workforce and delivery system that can adequately 
meet the needs of our increasingly diverse population, is more 
important than ever.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Ms. Campbell"&gt;Thank you again for this opportunity. I hope you find these 
remarks useful for your future deliberations and work.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.
WILLIAM KOHLHEPP, M.D., PRESIDENT, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT EDUCATION&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Dr. Kohlhepp. Great. Chairman Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro, 
and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity 
to speak to you today and to ask for your continued support of 
Title 7 primary care training and enhancement grants. These 
grants provide funding for curricular innovations, faculty 
development, access to care for underserved areas, and 
workforce diversity in the physician assistant profession, 
which I will refer to as PA.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;I am also here today to inform the committee about a 
critical situation that PA education programs face in accessing 
sufficient clinical education sites to train our students with 
patients.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;My name is Dr. William Kohlhepp, and I am president of the 
Physician Assistant Education Association, PAEA, and dean of 
the School of Health Sciences at Quinnipiac University. I speak 
to you today to underscore the importance of PA education and 
how PAs enhance inter-professional teams in our evolving 
healthcare system. We recommend $12,000,000 in funding to 
support PA education in Fiscal Year 2018 to enhance program 
innovation and the recruitment, training, and development of 
students and faculty at PA programs nationwide.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;The PA Program was created 50 years ago in response to a 
shortage of primary care physicians. PAs are educated as 
generalists, and we have a unique flexibility to fill gaps in 
both primary care and in specialties. PAs spend 2,000 hours in 
clinical training, second only to our physician colleagues in 
time devoted to training with patients. PAs enter primary care 
more than any other specialty.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Increasing demand for PAs has meant rapid growth of the 
profession. We have grown from three graduates to more than 
110,000. PAs are now licensed to practice medicine, including 
prescriptive authority, in every State and D.C. The pipeline to 
our profession is strong with the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
projecting a 30 percent increase in the number of PA positions 
between 2014 and 2024.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;PA programs are well positioned to continue increasing our 
output of PAs who can help meet the changing healthcare needs 
of the nation. However, efforts to increase the number of PA 
graduates must contend with one major barrier: the critical 
shortage of clinical training sites. We are trapped in somewhat 
of a vicious cycle. Projected shortages of clinicians have led 
to health professions to try to increase numbers of clinicians 
they graduate, which in turn increases pressure on clinical 
sites. At the same time, clinicians are facing new demands for 
increased productivity and implementation of new electronic 
health records, which has forced many potential preceptors to 
reduce their commitment to education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Finally, supply and demand pressures have led some programs 
to pay for clinical sites. More than a third of programs report 
paying for some or all sites, an increase of 14 percentage 
points since 2012. Surveys indicate that 95 percent of program 
directors are concerned about clinical site opportunities, and 
that nearly half report that the payment trend has negatively 
affected plans to increase enrollment.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Federal investments can help break this cycle. Title 7 
funds help improve clinical education and help programs to 
recruit applicants from disadvantaged and minority backgrounds. 
But Federal funding has not kept pace with program growth. 
Today there are 218 PA programs, yet the most recent training 
and primary care program competition funded only 13 programs 
out of that 218.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;PAEA's request for $12,000,000 to expand the capacity of PA 
education is an investment in improving access to primary care, 
which can reduce future healthcare costs. Federal incentives to 
encourage clinicians to precept PA and other students are a 
promising strategy for relieving the clinical site crisis, and 
would also promote inter-professional education.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;PAEA welcomes the opportunity to work with you to explore 
policies that will create a supportive environment for 
preceptors and lower barriers to accepting students into their 
practices. The number of PA programs in the congressional 
districts represented by this subcommittee total 55 out of the 
218. This committee has a real interest in PA program 
education. We invite you to see those programs in person.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Regardless of how healthcare reform plays out, the Nation's 
need for highly-trained will remain. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;I want to thank the gentleman very much for his
testimony and for highlighting a really important issue that we 
have, which is simply the lack of personnel to cover the needs 
of our population, whatever our system of health care delivery 
happens to be. Very valuable and very timely.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;    Dr. Kohlhepp. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;Let me just say thank you to you, Bill, for
the work that you do and for the work that Quinnipiac does.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;    Dr. Kohlhepp. Thank you, Congresswoman.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt; Really are outstanding. And as the Chairman
would point out, if we could get the 2017 bill out, we could 
have the opportunity for some increased or for some, you know, 
flat funding. But nevertheless, we would have some, you know, 
some resources there to deal with. But thank you very, very 
much for your testimony.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Well, on a totally unrelated issue, thank you for
the polling at Quinnipiac. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;    As an old pollster, I love that stuff, and actually one of 
my friends, Peter Brown, is associated with your program. It is 
very----
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;Mr. Chairman, that program was established
many, many, many, many, many years ago by a wonderful 
individual, whose name was Paul Falcigno. He has since passed 
on, but he served on the New Haven Board of Alderman with my 
mom all those years ago. So, I feel very proprietary about 
Quinnipiac, the polling, and the great work they do here. 
Thanks.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;    Dr. Kohlhepp. Our School of Health Sciences does great 
work.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;Amen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;    Dr. Kohlhepp. But I will give the prop out to the hockey 
team and to the poll.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;Amen. Amen.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;    Dr. Kohlhepp. Thank you for the opportunity to testify.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt; Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt; Thank you very much. Our next witness please?
Welcome.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Renner&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt; Good morning.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Good. Megan Renner, good to have you here. The
executive director of the U.S. Breastfeeding Committee. And the 
gentlelady is recognized for 5 minutes for whatever testimony 
she cares to give the committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;                      U.S. BREASTFEEDING COMMITTEE
MEGAN RENNER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, U.S. BREASTFEEDING COMMITTEE
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Renner&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;Thank you. Chairman Cole, Ranking Member
DeLauro, and members alert and members of the subcommittee, 
thank you for the invitation to present public witness 
testimony today. My name is Megan Renner, and I am the 
executive director of the U.S. Breastfeeding Committee, an 
independent, nonprofit coalition of more than 50 national 
organizations, with a network of State and local coalitions in 
all 50 States working collaboratively to create a landscape of 
support for breastfeeding families across our Nation.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;Breastfeeding is a proven primary prevention strategy, and 
the first food of breast milk builds a foundation for lifelong 
health and wellness. The evidence for the value of 
breastfeeding to children's and women's health is scientific, 
solid, and continually being reaffirmed by new research. 
Compared with formula fed infants, we know that those who are 
breast fed have a reduced risk of several acute illnesses in 
infancy as well as of SIDS and the debilitating disease of 
necrotizing enterocolitis that preemies can suffer from.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;In the longer term, mothers and children have a reduced 
risk of several chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, 
and asthma in children, and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
and breast and ovarian cancers in women. Yet these impacts 
beyond families, of course, also benefiting our Nation's 
employers and our economy.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;An updated and consolidated study just published in 2016 of 
both the maternal and pediatric health outcomes and associated 
costs showed that if 90 percent of our Nation's infants were 
breastfed according to medical recommendations, annually we 
would prevent 3,340 deaths, $3,000,000,000 in medical costs, 
and $14,200,000 in the costs of premature death.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;Everyone can, of course, agree that the decision to 
breastfeed is a personal one, and a mother should not be made 
to feel guilty when she cannot or chooses not to breastfeed. 
Yet we know the great majority of pregnant women and new 
mothers want to breastfeed, and 81 percent start out 
breastfeeding in the hospital. Despite this initial success, 
however, 6 in 10 breastfeeding mothers stop earlier than they 
intend. They are unable to reach their own personal goals due 
to a number of identified key barriers to breastfeeding.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;These obstacles, dubbed the booby traps by one of our 
member organizations, can be addressed through simple cost-
effective interventions. And that is why in 2011, Surgeon 
General Regina Benjamin launched the Surgeon General's Call to 
Action to support breast feeding, outlining 20 concrete action 
steps that would have the greatest impact across six different 
sectors of society.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;So, our priority recommendations address several of the 
surgeon general's 20 action steps by a robust collective action 
that cuts across multiple sectors. We believe there is great 
promise in the coordinated and collaborative approaches used by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further cost-
effective public health actions to increase healthy eating and 
physical activity.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;So, on behalf of the more than 3 million U.S. families that 
choose to breastfeed their newborns every year, I respectfully 
urge the subcommittee to sustain the bipartisan support for 
effective and innovative initiatives to support breastfeeding 
families, especially by a continuation of this funding for the 
CDC's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity, 
supporting Breastfeeding Families Program at the original 
requested amount of $50,000,000 a year. Congress has dedicated 
funding to this program for more than 5 years, and the impact 
of these investments has already been substantial with a 
special emphasis on maternity care practice improvement and 
continuity of care.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;We know the maternity care experience can influence both 
breastfeeding initiation and later infant feeding behavior, and 
the CDC collects data every 2 years through a national survey 
of maternity practices. The results of the 2015 survey showed 
that on average, U.S. hospitals scored 79 out of a possible 100 
points, which is an increase from an overall national score of 
just 63 in 2007 and 70 in 2011. By another measure over the 
same period, the percentage of hospitals implementing a 
majority of the recommended practices has increased from 29 
percent in 2007 to 62 percent in 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;These current CDC breastfeeding initiatives are also 
addressing the need to ensure healthcare professionals have 
sufficient knowledge and skills to increase access to 
professional and peer lactation support, and to support 
employers and child care providers to implement breastfeeding 
supports that have a critical impact when families return to 
work or school.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;Additional recommendations that we would like to put forth 
include directly funding the HHS Office of Women's Health, 
breastfeeding support programs, especially the initiatives to 
provide resources to employers to support nursing mothers in 
the workplace, and to support and inform breastfeeding mothers 
via the Your Guide to Breastfeeding, the It's Only Natural 
Campaign, and the OWH Women's Health Help Line.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;We also urge the subcommittee to address obstacles to 
greater availability of safe banked donor human milk for 
fragile infants by funding the Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality, to conduct a systematic review of evidence and a 
study on federal regulation and support of donor milk banks, 
and by funding the Health Resources and Services Administration 
to establish evidence-based clinical guidelines.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;Finally, we would like to also express support for 
continued funding of several affiliated programs, and ensuring 
incorporation and expansion of breastfeeding support within 
them, including the Reach Program, Racial and Ethnic Approaches 
to Community Health, the National Early Care and Early Care and 
Education Collaboratives under CDC, and within HRSA, the Title 
5 Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, especially the special 
projects of regional and national significance, Healthy Start, 
and the MIECHV Home Visiting Program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Ms. Renner"&gt;    Thank you again for this opportunity to share our 
recommendations. We are extremely grateful to the subcommittee 
for your sustained efforts to support these programs. Thank 
you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Thank you very much, the gentlelady, for her
testimony. Next witness please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Welcome.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;    Dr. Dalal. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Good to have you here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;    Dr. Dalal. Nice to be here.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;You will have to bear with me. Dr., is it Mehul
Dellah?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;    Dr. Dalal. Dr. Mehul Dalal.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Mehul Dalal. Well, thank you very much for your
indulgence, and it is great to have you here as a witness. The 
gentleman is the president of the National Association of 
Chronic Disease Directors. The gentleman is recognized for 5 
minutes for whatever testimony he cares to present to the 
committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.
MEHUL DALAL, M.D., PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHRONIC DISEASE&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Dr. Dalal. Thank you, Chairman Cole, Ranking Member 
DeLauro, and members of the committee for allowing me to 
testify on behalf of the National Association of Chronic 
Disease Directors, which I will refer to NACDD.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;My name is Mehul Dalal. I am currently serving my term as 
the president of board of directors for NACDD, and I am the 
State chronic disease director in Connecticut. Specifically, I 
want to express our strong support for increased funding for 
key chronic disease programs at CDC. Simply put out the grant 
and support of the CDC, most States would have an extremely 
limited ability to address these critical public health issues.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;These investments, as detailed in our written testimony, 
work to prevent disease in the first place, which in turn 
contributes to the economic productivity of the workforce, 
educational outcomes for children, and fitness levels for 
military recruits, and helps counteract the skyrocketing 
healthcare costs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;NACDD is a nonprofit public health organization that serves 
chronic disease program directors of each State and U.S. 
jurisdiction, and connects more than 6,000 chronic disease 
practitioners across the country. We represent a core sector of 
governmental public health, and we work closely with our 
executive and State territorial health agency leaders as well, 
as our governors and state legislatures.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Poor health of the population can exert a tremendous force, 
unemployment rates, interest costs, and other tangible factors 
that ultimately affect our ability to maintain a strong global 
economic position. The primary driver of costs in healthcare is 
chronic disease. According to the CDC, chronic disease accounts 
for approximately 75 percent of the Nation aggregate healthcare 
spending, or an estimated $5,300 for every individual in the&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Treatment of chronic disease constitutes an even larger 
portion of spending, 96 cents per dollar for Medicare and 83 
cents per dollar for Medicaid. As the American population ages, 
more people are categorized as high risk for multiple chronic 
diseases, and these health care costs are projected to continue 
their rise.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;State public health chronic disease prevention and control 
programs are key in improving the Nation's health and 
counteracting the rise in healthcare costs. States are 
implementing diverse and cost-effective strategies that worked 
to prevent diabetes, reduce heart disease and stroke, and 
promote fitness and nutrition in order to reduce the disability 
and costs associated with these conditions. As an example, in 
the New Haven area, CDC resources have supported us to work 
with community health centers and identify over 16,000 at-risk 
patients, and implement programs in the clinics and in the 
communities that educate and empower hundreds of patients to 
take charge of their own conditions.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;In one instance, a community health worker identified a 55-
year-old woman with diabetes who did not have a primary care 
physician. In addition to linking her to a primary care doctor, 
our program provided her with a gym membership and health 
coaching services. And with this support, she herself developed 
her own individualized fitness plan where she focused on Zumba 
and weightlifting. Over time she reduced her need for diabetes 
medications pills from six pills a day to a half a pill a day, 
and she dropped in size from a size 12 to a size four. And from 
the physician's standpoint, what I am interested in, she 
reduced her blood pressure by 10 percent, blood cholesterol by 
23 percent, and her blood sugar by 31 percent. Her family was 
so impressed by the success that she now is a source of 
encouragement and advice to her brother, her sister, her 
sister-in-law, who have all gone on to adopt healthy life 
changes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Multiply these examples by the tens of thousands across the 
Nation, and you can see how by working with large groups of 
people outside of the more expensive medical settings of 
clinics and doctors' offices, we are a good investment that 
saves healthcare dollars for Medicaid and Medicare and the 
entire health care system. Many of our program's approaches 
were developed by this committee's investments in NIH and the 
CDC, and without the work of my colleagues some of the 
wonderful findings of Federal research would sit on the shelf 
and never realize its full potential to improve health.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;The Prevention and Public Health Fund, also known as the 
Prevention Fund authorized on the Affordable Care Act, supplies 
more than 12 percent of the CDC budget, providing essential 
funds to help States keep communities healthy and safe. The 
Prevention Fund supports programs like the 317 Immunization 
Program, chronic disease prevention programs, and the entire 
Preventive Health Block Grant, which is the only source of 
flexible funding for the States and U.S. territories to 
American Indian tribes and the District of Columbia to tailor 
preventive and health promotion programs to their population's 
specific needs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Today only a small fraction of the United States 
governmental health investment supports prevention and health 
promotion. Substantial investment in the CDC and the state 
health departments are necessary for a real impact to be made. 
These programs must include increased resources for every State 
to address State-specific public health challenges, diabetes 
prevention and control, heart disease prevention, and improving 
physical activity and nutrition.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Public health programs work to improve care, prevent 
disease, and prevent complications of disease. An investment in 
chronic disease prevention and control programs saves lives, 
improves the quality of life, and saves healthcare dollars.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to appear before 
you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;[The information follows:]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;I want to thank the gentleman very much for his
testimony and particularly for the focus on CDC. We get a lot, 
and appropriately, a lot of focus on NIH and the splendid work 
they do. But I always like to say, you know, the CDC is every 
bit as important in defending the lives of Americans as the 
Pentagon is, and in some ways more. You are more likely to die 
in a pandemic than you are in a terrorist attack.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;And these long-term contributions of changing lifestyle are 
really priceless investments. As you pointed out in your 
testimony, the money saved on the back end in Medicare and 
Medicaid is just unbelievable. So, I thank the gentleman for 
his focus on a very important issue for this committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;    Dr. Dalal. Yeah, thank you for your support.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Dr.
Dalal. Thank you very, very much for the work that you do. I 
think that the chairman talked about the work of the CDC in 
this area. And what this is about is the strengthening of our 
States and their ability to cope with the issue of chronic 
disease. And it is not situated here, but it is in the States, 
and providing those funds to the States is critical.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;The other point that you make, I think we have to be very, 
very careful if we are looking at eliminating the Prevention 
Fund albeit in 2017. And in addition to that, actually the 
Prevention Fund was a backup and a way in which we could look 
to provide critical funding in a number of areas which the CDC 
has laid out over the years. But if we are going to be in the 
business of cutting back on appropriations, Mr. Chairman, and 
if we are going to eliminate the Prevention Fund, we are really 
going to put people at grave risk and not take advantage of the 
expertise and the dedication of folks who are trying to deal 
with chronic disease when we know that 70 percent of the 
population is dealing with a chronic illness.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;So, thank you very, very much. Where do you live in New 
Haven?&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;    Dr. Dalal. In the East Rock neighborhood.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;All right. Okay. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt;    Dr. Dalal. I think we are neighbors.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeLauro&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"&gt; We are neighbors. Thank you.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Next witness, please.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt; Kopp.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Cole&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;Kopp. Thank you for correcting me. President of
the National Senior Corps Association. The gentlelady is 
recognized for 5 minutes to deliver whatever testimony she 
cares to the subcommittee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Mr. Cole"&gt;                                          Wednesday, March 8, 2017.
LYNNETTA KOPP, PRESIDENT, THE NATIONAL SENIOR CORPS ASSOCIATION
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. Kopp&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Thank you. Chairman Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro,
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to 
appear before you today to discuss funding for the three Senior 
Corps programs administered by the Corporation for National and 
Community Service. Those programs are the Foster Grandparent 
Program, the RSVP Program, and the Senior Companion program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;The funding levels we are requesting today are as follows: 
for the Foster Grandparent Program, $107,702,000; RSVP, 
$63,000,000; and Senior Companion Program, $45,512,000.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;My name is Lynnetta Kopp, and I testified today as 
president of the National Senior Corps Association, 
representing the interest of Senior Corps directors, 
volunteers, and the people and communities we serve. I also 
bring regards from my colleagues in the leadership of the 
National Association of Foster Grandparent Directors and the 
National Association of RSVP directors, who also embrace this 
request.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Senior Corps is a federally authorized and funded network 
of National Service programs that provide individuals age 55 
and better an opportunity to share their life experience 
through volunteer service, meeting unmet community needs in our 
community. I have had the pleasure of being an RSVP director 
and a foster grandparent director in Lacrosse, Wisconsin for 
the past 14 years. I come before you today advocating for 
funding for the continuance of these three Senior Corps 
programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;The requested funding would restore the level to 20 percent 
of the cut, which RSVP lost over 100,000 volunteer positions. 
This funding would also provide sufficient funding to sustain 
the Foster Grandparent Program and Senior Companion Programs at 
their current levels.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="589" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;The new Administration will be presenting the Fiscal Year 
2018 budget shortly, which may eliminate funding for the 
Corporation of National Community Service. And to coin a 
phrase, this would be penny wise and pound foolish. Not only 
have these programs enjoyed bipartisan support from members of 
Congress, including those of you who are serving on this 
committee, these programs are incredibly cost-effective. For 
every $1 spent on volunteer service in our Nation, our 
communities reap a nearly tenfold return in the Foster 
Grandparent Program and the Senior Companion Program, and even 
more so from a return on their investment in the RSVP Program, 
given the low cost per volunteer for this program.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="590" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;The two stipend programs, Foster Grandparent and Senior 
Companion Program, provide low-income seniors with an 
opportunity to serve. And in the case of the Foster Grandparent 
program, it allows them to serve at-risk students and 
disadvantaged youth and homebound and frail seniors through the 
Senior Companion Program. There is not a day that goes by that 
our Senior Corps directors do not receive testimonials on the 
value of the service that this program provides.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="591" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;RSVP matches individuals' personal interests with those 
skills and volunteers with opportunities to fill these unmet 
community needs. As the largest senior volunteer organization 
in the Nation, RSVP has been improving the lives of their 
neighbors and friends since 1971, meeting the unmet needs in 
our communities, whether it is helping prepare tax returns, 
provide transportation services, offer respite to caregivers, 
tutor children, repair homes, support veterans and military 
families, or assist victims of disaster areas. These are just a 
few of the things that these programs help to do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="592" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;RSVP volunteers served 329,000 veterans through 
transportation and employment services, referrals and 
mentored--I am sorry--more than 78,000 children, provided 
independent living services to 797,000 adults, and primarily 
those were frail seniors. Also, provided respite services to 
20,300 families, engaged 20,100 veterans who serve as RSVP 
volunteers, and leveraged an additional 18,500 volunteers to 
support RSVP activities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="593" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;All told, roughly $200,000,000, which funds the Senior 
Corps, provides a $2,300,000,000 return on investment. And 
according to data compiled by the independent sector, more than 
25,000 foster grandparents supported by this request would 
contribute 24 million hours of service. This is valued at over 
$565,000,000. This would enhance 62 million hours of service, 
which is valued at over $1,000,000,460 based on the independent 
sector data, which averages a volunteer hour at $23.56. And the 
more than 12,000 senior companions underwritten by this budget 
would provide 12.2 million hours or service, valued at 
$287,432,000, helping roughly 61,000,000 older frail seniors in 
our community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="594" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;The Senior Corps has over 45 years of successful 
performance measurement, and we do have a return on our 
investment. While great value is derived by the beneficiaries 
of senior service, the benefit to those who serve is tangible 
and measurable. By keeping seniors active and involved, Senior 
Corps keeps older Americans vibrant and in their communities, 
avoiding the cost of institutionalization, keeping bright the 
social connections seniors need to remain vital and truly what 
we define as community in a country too frequently measured by 
our differences these days than by our commonalities.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="595" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Chairman Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro, and members of the 
committee, the commitment that you have previously given to our 
programs is indeed appreciated. On behalf of the thousands of 
volunteers, organizations, and agencies who rely on Senior 
Corps, we ask you to continue your support and join us in 
championing our budget request for these vital programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="596" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;But on a more personal note, thank you for your public 
service, and remember you do not have to be retired to be an 
RSVP volunteer. Thank you. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;

her testimony, and I am sure most members of this committee, 
probably every member, can testify to the value of these 
programs.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="605" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Absolutely. Thank you.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Chief executive officer of the National Marrow 
Donor Program and To Be Matched. So, welcome. It is good to 
have you here. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes for 
her testimony he cares to deliver to the committee.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM/BE THE MATCH
JEFFREY W. CHELL, M.D., CEO, NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM/BE THE MATCH&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Dr.  Chell. Thank you, Chairman Cole, and other 
distinguished members of the committee. My name is Jeffrey 
Chell, and I am proud to serve as the chief executive officer 
of the National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;We also proudly operate the C.W. Bill Young Cell 
Transplantation Program through three competitively bid 
contracts with the Health Resource Service Administration. 
These contracts include a single point of access and Office of 
Patient Advocacy, the Bone Marrow Coordinating Center, and the 
Cord Blood Coordinating Center. Collectively these contracts 
allow NMBP to operate the National Be The Match Registry and 
provide lifesaving, unrelated transplants using individual 
altruistic adult donors and cord blood units. We also work 
closely with the cord blood banks that receive critically 
important funding directly through the National Cord Blood 
Inventory.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;I would like to thank Chairman Cole, Ranking Member 
DeLauro, and all the members of the Committee for inviting me 
to speak. On behalf of Be The Match and our 565 network 
partners, we want to thank you for maintaining the 
congressional commitment to patients fighting blood cancers and 
other disorders, for the only possible cure is an unrelated 
transplant.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;For each $1,000,000 that Congress adds to the program, 
10,000 donors are added to the program. For each million it 
adds to the NCBI, an additional 667 cord blood units will be 
collected and stored. As you can see, these dollars go directly 
to saving lives.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Because our funding has been flat for over a decade, for 
Fiscal Year 2018, we ask that Congress modestly increase our 
funding by $5,000,000 for the program. That allows us to 
replenish the registry as donors age off the registry, and also 
increase our efforts to add diversity to the registry as 
patients are most likely to find a donor with someone that they 
share a common ancestry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;We also ask Congress to increase the NCBI funding by 
$5,000,000 over previous years, consistent with last year's 
numbers from this subcommittee, to fund the additional 
collection of cord blood units. These units have been 
exceedingly helpful in providing lifesaving transplants for 
patients who are difficult to match who are also members of our 
ethnic minority communities. Congress has authorized both the 
national registry and NCBI, most recently unanimously for 
another 5 years, in December of 2015.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;As I testify before you today, I am reminded of the 
foresight that this committee had in the mid-1980s that created 
the program on which Americans rely today. Through the 
leadership of late Congressman Bill Young, the Congress decided 
to establish the national registry where men, women, and 
children with leukemia and other fatal disorders could find 
that unrelated donor that could save their lives. Since 
Congress made this important decision to establish the registry 
30 years ago, Be The Match has formed a highly successful 
public/private partnership and has made tremendous progress. We 
are honored to continue to serve as the steward of this 
critical national resource.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Today we remain the single point of access for both cord 
blood units and adult volunteer donors, and again provide the 
only hope of cure for 70 different medical conditions, 
including blood cancers and sickle cell disease. The Be The 
Match Registry has grown to nearly 16 million donors and more 
than 238,000 cord blood units, including 93,000 collected 
through the National Cord Blood Inventory. We have facilitated 
more than 80,000 transplants since our founding, and currently 
are track facilitating 60 to 100 transplants per year.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Because we collect data on all of these transplants, we 
have been able to improve patient outcomes and reduce the 
complication rates of transplants. During the past 20 years, 
the 1-year survival rate from these transplants has gone from 
40 percent now to over 70 percent.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;But there really is so much more that we can do. The need 
for transplant is increasing, particularly for older Americans, 
and we are currently only meeting half the need in the United 
States. New indications, such as curing sickle cell disease, 
also drive the need for more volunteer donors and cord blood 
units. With the Federal dollars that you allocate to the 
program, we continue our efforts to expand the diversity of the 
registry and increase the number of minority cord blood units 
listed on the registry.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Federal funding remains critical to continue us to provide 
access to transplant, and the funds for the program and NCBI 
continue to allow us to increase the likelihood that each and 
every American can receive that lifesaving transplant.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;We thank you for your ongoing support of the program and 
the NCBI, and while we understand the very difficult budget 
situation, we know that any additional funding for these 
programs will go directly to helping us cure more patients in 
need.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Thank you. I want to thank you for your very 
valuable testimony, and thank you particularly for mentioning 
our late good friend Mr. Young, who, when he left us, was the 
longest-serving Republican in Congress and, of course, on this 
committee for many years. Chaired the full committee. He is 
often known obviously for the extraordinary work he did on 
defense issues in the capacity of chairing that. But he touched 
this committee and a lot of different ways over many decades, 
and this is a worthy legacy for him. So, thank you very much 
for mentioning his name.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Dr.  Chell. He often shared with me that one of the things 
he was most proud of in his service was helping develop this 
program and the 80,000 lives that he has helped to save.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Mr.  Cole. He had a lot to be proud of over many decades.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Dr.  Chell. Thank you so much.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Thank you. And our last witness of the morning, 
the early afternoon, but it is early afternoon. We are pretty 
much on schedule. Welcome. Good to have you here.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Good afternoon.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Susan Ruzenski. I hope I got that right.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Ms.  Ruzenski. Yes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Mr.  Cole. Executive director of the Helen Keller National 
Center for the Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults. So, welcome to the 
committee. The gentlelady is recognized for 5 minutes for 
whatever testimony she cares to give.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;----------&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Wednesday, March 8, 2017.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;HELEN KELLER NATIONAL CENTER FOR DEAF-BLIND YOUTH AND ADULTS
 SUSAN RUZENSKI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HELEN KELLER NATIONAL CENTER FOR&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;DEAF-BLIND YOUTH AND ADULTS&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Ms.  Ruzenski. Thank you, Chairman Cole, and Ranking Member 
DeLauro, and members of the Subcommittee for providing me with 
this opportunity to testify on behalf of the Helen Keller 
National Center. I am Sue Ruzenski. I have been the executive 
director since 2014, and I am proud to say I have been working 
with Helen Keller National Center for the last 38 years.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Our mission is to enable each person who is deaf and blind 
to live, work, and thrive in their community of choice. And my 
objective this morning is to provide you with clear and 
specific justification why the Helen Keller National Center is 
requesting an increase in funding of $4,700,000 in Fiscal Year 
2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;And why is this funding vital for HKNC's ability to meet 
our five congressional mandates that was set forth 50 years ago 
this past October, as we were made an act of Congress. Our 
current annual appropriation is $10,300,000, and the increase 
is a request that will bring us to $15,000,000 annually in 
2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;The five mandates that were set forth in the HKNC Act are: 
to provide specialized and intensive services to any deaf-blind 
person in the United States; to train and support family 
members; to train professionals and equip them with the 
competencies to work effectively with individuals who are deaf-
blind; to conduct applied research and, with respect to best 
practices, disseminate those practices throughout the country; 
and maintain a national registry of individuals who are deaf-
blind.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;We strive to accomplish our mission through three avenues. 
We are the only national vocational rehabilitation program that 
is working exclusively with youth and adults who are deaf-
blind. We have 10 regional offices throughout the United 
States, and we have an information research and professional 
development department.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Our vision is to solidify a network of qualified service 
providers nationwide who can address the training needs of 
people who are deaf-blind in their local areas throughout the 
United States. The foundation of this national infrastructure 
has already been established over the past 50 years, but now it 
is essential for us to secure adequate resource to ensure that 
the standards of practice of professionals are implemented at a 
national level, and the collaborative efforts in a coordinated 
and sustainable national service delivery.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;HKNC is ready to lead this charge given the $50,000,000 
annual appropriation. Essentially, HKNC has been level funded 
for 16 years. In 2016, we received a $1,200,000 increase, and 
for that we are very grateful. The critical need, however, 
still exists, and the level of funding to commensurate with the 
scope and the importance of this work remains.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;With level of funding spanning over that 16-year period, we 
had to really make some tough decisions. We had to eliminate 
and suspend some of our programs. The comprehensive 
rehabilitation program now serves fewer people on an annual 
basis, and we have more than a 1-year waiting list for people 
coming to the program. For a person who has an experience of a 
sudden change, a loss in vision and hearing, a 1-year waiting 
period is not acceptable.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;I can share with you a story about a gentleman named 
Carlos. He was an ex-Marine, and this happened to Carlos. He 
had tumors which caused a sudden change, total loss of vision 
and hearing. When he arrived at the program, his only way of 
communicating was the use of block letters printed on his back, 
and we would spell out the words to him.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Through training over a 2-year period, he was able to learn 
Braille, tactile sign language, the use of adaptive equipment. 
He is now living in his own apartment in California and 
attending college on a part-time basis. The provision of those 
timely, quality services made a profound difference to Carlos' 
quality of life.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;HKNC has taken steps. Given that increase of 1,200,000 in 
2016, we conducted five statewide needs assessments in 
collaboration with Mississippi State University and the States 
of Georgia, Arizona, Missouri, Oregon, and New York. And the 
results became the basis of how we develop modules for an array 
of professionals, including VR counselors as well as mental 
health professionals.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;We address many of the training priority areas that were 
identified in adaptive technology, self-advocacy, haptics 
orientational ability, just to name a few. We also established 
a National Community of Practice. We have 38 partner agencies, 
both State and private, who are working with us who are 
interested in strengthening the vocational rehabilitation 
options for people who are deaf-blind. And together we share 
learning, conduct research, and disseminate and implement best 
practices.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="659" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;In 2011, Westat Corporation did a 2-year evaluation of 
HKNC, and that was on behalf of the Department of Education the 
Rehabilitation Services Administration. We were identified as 
the gold standard by those that are familiar with our work. And 
what this study did reveal, however, is that most States lack 
services and the resources, reconfirming HKNC's goal to build 
this national sustainable infrastructure.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="660" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;The Federal government's 50-year investment has made a 
tremendous impact. We have touched the lives in the past 10 
years of over 16,000 deaf-blind individuals. For those 
individuals with a desire to work, 51 percent are competitively 
employed.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="661" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;In summary, we have a plan. For this $4,700,000, what would 
we do? We would maximize the effectiveness of this National 
Community of Practice. We would replicate our community 
services program in four States. We deploy 20 deaf-blind 
specialists, two in each region around the country, boots on 
the ground, working with people who are deaf-blind with our 
field staff. We provide and coordinate further research to 
propel this field, and increase the capacity of our ability to 
offer comprehensive vocational and rehabilitation services to a 
greater number of individuals on an annual basis.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="662" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Congressional leaders 50 years ago shared our commitment 
and our vision for services for people who are deaf-blind, and 
the Helen Keller National Center is at a critical moment in 
their history. The time has come for national service delivery 
to be created so that all American citizens who are deaf-blind 
have an equal opportunity to live self-actualized lives and 
contribute as members of their community.&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;paragraph paraId="670" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Mr.  Cole. I thank the gentlelady her testimony and her 
appearance here today, our last witness. And let me just say in 
conclusion before I recognize my friend from Connecticut for 
whatever remarks she cares to make, we appreciate each and 
every one of you, the witnesses in particular, that traveled a 
long way and came here to offer your valuable testimony. We 
certainly will take them under advisement.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="671" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;As my friend has pointed out, a lot of this depends on, 
frankly, what kind of allocation the subcommittee gets, and 
that has yet to be decided. We will not know that for several 
weeks yet. But anyway, this really does help us a great deal, 
and we would urge those of you that can to help us persuade our 
colleagues to get the 2017 bill done, and then obviously make 
sure that we have an adequate allocation to meet some of these 
really pressing national needs and priorities as we look 
forward to 2018.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="672" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;I recognize my friend for one little comment she cares to 
make.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Ms.  DeLauro. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman, and thank 
you for your commitment to, you know, making sure we get out 
the 2017 bill, and that we are ready to advocate for an 
increased allocation for 2018 because as you have remarked, the 
array of witnesses this morning demonstrate again, I think, for 
the two of us the expansive role that the Federal government 
has in these various areas that help to make a difference in 
people's lives. And they are all worthy causes.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;And as an adjunct to that, to all of you who spend your 
lives and your professional careers to advocate on behalf of 
people who need the services that your organizations are 
providing to the young people who are making their way, but 
without the continued resources in some of these areas other 
youngsters will not be able to realize their own dreams and 
aspirations.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;But that is why at the outset, I said this is a bill that 
affects every single aspect of a person's life. And after 
defense today, but in the subsequent days, to make sure that we 
have the resources in our allocation to be able to meet your 
needs. We cannot meet every need. The Federal government cannot 
do everything, but its role is to be an advocate, the same way 
that you are advocates for what you do.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="676" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Thank you for being with us today, and I know we will 
continue our contact over the next month. Many thanks. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;Mr.  Cole. I must say in closing, the dedication of our 
ranking member could not be more obvious. [Laughter.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;The fact that she was here the entire hearing when 
obviously this was not the easiest day for her to be here. And, 
you know, I just once again want to express my admiration and 
appreciation for my friend for her tireless advocacy. She never 
misses a chance to make a point, even when it is difficult for 
her to make that point as it was today, but always does it very 
well.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;So, you know, I thank you all for attending. We are 
adjourned.&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Ms. Kopp"&gt;[Applause.]&lt;/paragraph&gt;
