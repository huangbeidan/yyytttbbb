						(A)Study and

				transition to trading and quoting securities in one penny increments, also

				has had on the number of initial public offerings since its implementation
				relative to the period before its implementation. The study shall also examine

				capitalization company securities and whether there is sufficient economic

				increments. Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this
