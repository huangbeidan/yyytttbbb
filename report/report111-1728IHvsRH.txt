			 Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 and the Truth in Lending Act,
			 respectively. Any final disclosures as a result of such regulations issued by
			 the Secretary and the Board shall take effect on the same date, and not later
			 than the expiration of the 12-month period beginning on the date of the
			 enactment of this Act. If either the Secretary or the Board fails to act during
			 such 12-month period, either such agency may act independently and implement
			 final regulations.

			 such property pursuant to the foreclosure shall assume such interest subject
			 to—
						(A)except as provided in paragraph (2), the
			 rights of any bona fide tenant, as of the date of foreclosure under any bona
			 fide lease entered into before the date of foreclosure, to occupy the premises
			 until the end of the remaining term of the lease; and
						(B)the rights of any bona fide tenant, as of
			 the date of foreclosure, without a lease or with a lease terminable at will
			 under State law, subject to the provision by the immediate successor in
			 interest and the receipt by the tenant in the unit, of a notice to vacate at
			 least 90 days before the effective date of such notice.
						(2)Exception for
			 subsequent owner-occupantNotwithstanding paragraph (1), if the
			 immediate successor in interest of any dwelling or residential real property
			 that is otherwise subject to paragraph (1) is a purchaser who will occupy a
			 unit of the dwelling or residential real property as a primary residence, or
			 such successor in interest sells the dwelling or residential real property to a
			 purchaser who will occupy a unit of the dwelling or residential real property,
			 as a primary residence—
						(A)such purchaser may
			 terminate a lease relating to such unit on the effective date of a notice to
			 vacate; and
						(B)such notice to vacate shall be provided by
			 the purchaser to the tenant in such unit at least 90 days before the effective
			 date of such notice.
						(3)Bona fide lease or
			 tenancyFor purposes of this
			 subsection, a lease or tenancy shall be considered bona fide only if—
						(A)the mortgagor under the contract is not the
			 tenant;
						(B)the lease or tenancy was
			 the result of an arms-length transaction; and
						(C)the lease or tenancy
			 requires the receipt of rent that is not substantially less than fair market

			 Federal, State, or local subsidy.
						(4)Rule of

			 specific provisions of this subsection, no provision of this subsection shall
			 be construed as affecting the requirements for termination of any Federal- or
			 State-subsidized tenancy. The provisions of this subsection shall not be
			 construed to limit any State or local law that provides longer time periods or
			 other additional protections for tenants.
					(b)Corresponding provision
			 relating to effect of foreclosures on section 8
			 tenanciesParagraph (7) of section 8(o) of the United States
			 Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(7)) is amended—
					(1)in subparagraph (C), by inserting before
			 the semicolon at the end the following:
						
							, and
			 in the case of an owner who is an immediate successor in interest pursuant to
			 foreclosure—(i)during the initial term of the tenant’s
				lease, having the property vacant prior to sale shall not constitute good

							(ii)in subsequent lease
				terms of the tenant’s lease, who will occupy the unit as a primary residence,
				who sells the property to a purchaser who will occupy a unit of the property as
				a primary residence, or if the unit is unmarketable while occupied, such owner
				may terminate a lease relating to such unit for good cause on the effective
				date of the notice to vacate, where such notice is provided by the owner to the
				tenant in such unit at least 90 days before the effective date of such
				notice;
							.
					(2)in subparagraph (E), by
			 striking and at the end;
					(3)by redesignating
			 subparagraph (F) as subparagraph (G); and
					(4)by inserting after
			 subparagraph (E) the following:
						
							(F)shall provide that in the case of any
				foreclosure on any residential real property in which a recipient of assistance
				under this subsection resides, the immediate successor in interest in such
				property pursuant to the foreclosure shall assume such interest subject to the
				lease between the prior owner and the tenant and to the housing assistance
				payments contract between the prior owner and the public housing agency for the
				occupied unit; if a public housing agency is unable to make payments under the
				contract to the immediate successor in interest after foreclosure, due to
				action or inaction by the successor in interest, including the rejection of
				payments or the failure of the successor to maintain the unit in compliance
				with paragraph (8) or an inability to identify the successor, the agency may
				use funds that would have been used to pay the rental amount on behalf of the

				points and fees with respect to a high-cost mortgage for purposes of subsection
				(aa):
								(A)Up to and including 2 bona fide discount

				interest rate from which the mortgage`s interest rate will be discounted does

				shall not apply to discount points used to purchase an interest rate reduction
				unless the amount of the interest rate reduction purchased is reasonably
				consistent with established industry norms and practices for secondary mortgage

							1124.Appraisal management
				company minimum qualifications
								(a)In
				generalThe Appraiser
				Qualifications Board of the Appraisal Foundation shall establish minimum
				qualifications to be applied by a State in the registration of appraisal
				management companies. Such qualifications shall include a requirement that such
				companies—
									(1)register with and be subject to supervision
				by a State appraiser certifying and licensing agency in each State in which
				such company operates;
									(2)verify that only licensed
				or certified appraisers are used for federally related transactions;
									(3)require that appraisals
				coordinated by an appraisal management company comply with the Uniform
				Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice; and
									(4)require that appraisals
				are conducted independently and free from inappropriate influence and coercion
				pursuant to the appraisal independence standards established under section 129E
				of the Truth in Lending Act.
									(b)Exception for federally
				regulated financial institutionsThe requirements of subsection (a) shall
				not apply to an appraisal management company that is a subsidiary owned and
				controlled by a financial institution and regulated by a federal financial
				institution regulatory agency. In such case, the appropriate federal financial
				institutions regulatory agency shall, at a minimum, develop regulations
				affecting the operations of the appraisal management company to—
									(1)verify that only licensed
				or certified appraisers are used for federally related transactions;
									(2)require that appraisals
				coordinated by an institution or subsidiary providing appraisal management
				services comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice;
				and
									(3)require that appraisals
				are conducted independently and free from inappropriate influence and coercion
				pursuant to the appraisal independence standards established under section 129E
				of the Truth in Lending Act.
									(c)Registration
				limitationsAn appraisal
				management company shall not be registered by a State if such company, in whole
				or in part, directly or indirectly, is owned by any person who has had an
				appraiser license or certificate refused, denied, cancelled, surrendered in
				lieu of revocation, or revoked in any State. Additionally, each person that
				owns more than 10 percent of an appraisal management company shall be of good
				moral character, as determined by the State appraiser certifying and licensing
				agency, and shall submit to a background investigation carried out by the State
				appraiser certifying and licensing agency.
								(d)RegulationsThe Appraisal Subcommittee shall promulgate
				regulations to implement the minimum qualifications developed by the Appraiser
				Qualifications Board under this section, as such qualifications relate to the
				State appraiser certifying and licensing agencies. The Appraisal Subcommittee
				shall also promulgate regulations for the reporting of the activities of
				appraisal management companies in determining the payment of the annual
				registry fee.
								(e)Effective date
									(1)In
				generalNo appraisal management company may perform services
				related to a federally related transaction in a State after the date that is 36
				months after the date of the enactment of this section unless such company is
				registered with such State or subject to oversight by a federal financial
				institutions regulatory agency.
									(2)Extension of effective
				dateSubject to the approval
				of the Council, the Appraisal Subcommittee may extend by an additional 12
				months the requirements for the registration and supervision of appraisal
				management companies if it makes a written finding that a State has made
				substantial progress in establishing a State appraisal management company
				registration and supervision system that appears to conform with the provisions
				of this
				title.

			 regarding the importance of government sponsored enterprises reform
			701.Sense of Congress
			 regarding the importance of Government-sponsored enterprises reform to enhance
			 the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage
			 credit
				(a)FindingsThe Congress finds as follows:
					(1)The Government-sponsored
			 enterprises, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal
			 Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), were chartered by Congress to
			 ensure a reliable and affordable supply of mortgage funding, but enjoy a dual
			 legal status as privately owned corporations with Government mandated
			 affordable housing goals.
					(2)In 1996, the Department
			 of Housing and Urban Development required that 42 percent of Fannie Mae’s and
			 Freddie Mac’s mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income levels
			 below the median for a given area.
					(3)In 2004, the Department
			 of Housing and Urban Development revised those goals, increasing them to 56
			 percent of their overall mortgage purchases by 2008, and additionally mandated
			 that 12 percent of all mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac be
			 special affordable loans made to borrowers with incomes less
			 than 60 percent of an area’s median income, a target that ultimately increased
			 to 28 percent for 2008.
					(4)To help fulfill those
			 mandated affordable housing goals, in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban
			 Development authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime
			 securities that included loans made to low-income borrowers.
					(5)After this authorization
			 to purchase subprime securities, subprime and near-prime loans increased from 9
			 percent of securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006, while the
			 market share of conventional mortgages dropped from 78.8 percent in 2003 to
			 50.1 percent by 2007 with a corresponding increase in subprime and Alt-A loans
			 from 10.1 percent to 32.7 percent over the same period.
					(6)In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae
			 and Freddie Mac purchased $175,000,000,000 in subprime mortgage securities,
			 which accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from 2005 through
			 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in
			 subprime and Alt-A loans, while Fannie Mae’s acquisitions of mortgages with
			 less than 10 percent down payments almost tripled.
					(7)According to data from
			 the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008,
			 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly originated
			 mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently own 13.3 percent of
			 outstanding mortgage debt in the United States and have issued mortgage-backed
			 securities for 31.0 percent of the residential debt market, a combined total of
			 44.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States.
					(8)On September 7, 2008, the
			 FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury
			 Department subsequently agreeing to purchase at least $200,000,000,000 of
			 preferred stock from each enterprise in exchange for warrants for the purchase
			 of 79.9 percent of each enterprise’s common stock.
					(9)The conservatorship for
			 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has potentially exposed taxpayers to upwards of
			 $5,300,000,000,000 worth of risk.
					(10)The hybrid
			 public-private status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is untenable and must be
			 resolved to assure that consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage
			 loans on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans and
			 that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, or abusive.
					(b)Sense of the
			 CongressIt is the sense of the Congress that efforts to enhance
			 by the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential
			 mortgage credit and the practices related to such credit would be incomplete
			 without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie
			 Mac.
