The program established under this section shall, at a minimum—
(i) characterize physical, chemical, and biological harbor conditions relevant to ballast discharge into United States waters to inform the design and implementation of ship vector control technologies and practices;
(ii)develop testing protocols for determining the effectiveness of vessel vector monitoring and control technologies and practices;
(iii)demonstrate methods for mitigating the spread of invasive species by coastal voyages, including exploring the effectiveness of alternative exchange zones in the near coastal areas and other methods proposed to reduce transfers of organisms;
(iv)verify the practical effectiveness of any process for approving a type of alternative ballast water management as meeting standards established under this subsection, to ensure that the process produces repeatable and accurate assessments of treatment effectiveness; and
(v)evaluate the effectiveness and residual risk and environmental impacts associated with any standard set with respect to the vessel pathways.
(B)Authorization of appropriationsIn addition to other amounts authorized by this title, to carry out this paragraph there are authorized to be appropriated $1,500,000 to the Secretary and $1,500,000 to the Under Secretary for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012."}
