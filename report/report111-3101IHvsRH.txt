(f)Video Description 
(1)Reinstatement of regulationsOn the day that is 1 year after the date of enactment of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, the Commission shall, after a rulemaking, reinstate its video description regulations contained in the Implementation of Video Description of Video Programming Report and Order (15 F.C.C.R. 15,230 (2000)), modified as provided in paragraph (2). 
(2)Modifications to reinstated regulationsSuch regulations shall be modified only as follows: 
(A)The regulations shall apply to video programming, as defined in subsection (i), insofar as such programming is transmitted for display on television in digital format. 
(B)The Commission shall update the list of the top 25 Designated Market Areas, the list of the top 5 national nonbroadcast networks that have at least 50 hours per quarter of prime time programming that is not exempt under this paragraph, and the designation of the beginning calendar quarter for which compliance shall be calculated. 
(C)The regulations may permit a provider of video programming or a program owner to petition the Commission for an exemption from the requirements of this section upon a showing that the requirements contained in this section would be economically burdensome. 
(D)The Commission may exempt from the regulations established pursuant to paragraph (1) a service, class of services, program, class of programs, equipment, or class of equipment for which the Commission has determined that the application of such regulations would be economically burdensome for the provider of such service, program, or equipment. 
(E)The regulations shall not apply to live or near-live programming. 
(F)The regulations shall provide for an appropriate phased schedule of deadlines for compliance. 
(3)Inquiries on further video description requirementsThe Commission shall commence the following inquiries not later than 1 year after the completion of the phase-in of the reinstated regulations and shall report to Congress 1 year thereafter on the findings for each of the following: 
(A)Video description in television programmingThe availability, use, and benefits of video description on video programming distributed on television, the technical and creative issues associated with providing such video description, and the financial costs of providing such video description for providers of video programming and program owners. 
(B)Video description in video programming distributed on the internetThe technical and operational issues, costs, and benefits of providing video descriptions for video programming that is delivered using Internet protocol. 
(4)Continuing Commission authority 
(A)In generalThe Commission may issue additional regulations if the Commission determines, at least 2 years after completing the reports required in paragraph (3), that the need for and benefits of providing video descriptions for video programming, insofar as such programming is transmitted for display on television, are greater than the technical and economic costs of providing such additional programming. If the Commission makes such a determination and issues additional regulations, the Commission may increase, in total, the hours requirement for described video programming, insofar as such programming is transmitted for display on television, up to 75 percent of the requirement in the regulations reinstated under paragraph (1).  
(B)Further requirements 
(i)ReportNine years after the date of enactment of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, the Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report assessing— 
(I)the types of described video programming that is available to consumers; 
(II)consumer use of such programming;  
(III)the costs to program owners, providers, and distributors of creating such programming; 
(IV)the benefits to consumers of such programming; 
(V)the amount of such programming currently available; and 
(VI)the need for additional described programming. 
(ii)Increased availabilityTen years after the date of enactment of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, the Commission shall have the authority, based upon the findings, conclusions, and recommendations contained in the report under clause (i), to increase the availability of such programming. 
(C)Application to designated market areas 
(i)In generalAfter the Commission completes the study on video description, the Commission shall phase in the video description regulations for all designated market areas, except that the Commission may grant waivers to entities in specific designated market areas where it deems appropriate.  
(ii)Phase-in deadlineThe phase-in described under clause (i) shall be completed not later than 6 years after the date of enactment of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010. 
(g)Emergency informationNot later than 1 year after the Video Programming and Emergency Access Advisory Committee report under section 201(e)(2) of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 is submitted to the Commission, the Commission shall complete a proceeding to— 
(1)identify methods to convey emergency information (as that term is defined in section 79.2 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations) in a manner accessible to individuals who are blind or have a visual impairment; and  
(2)promulgate regulations that require video programming providers and video programming distributors (as those terms are defined in section 79.1 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations) and program owners to convey such emergency information in a manner accessible to individuals who are blind or have a visual impairment. 
(h)Responsibilities 
(1)Video programming ownerA video programming owner shall ensure that any closed captioning and video description required pursuant to this section is provided in accordance with the technical standards, protocols, and procedures established by the Commission. 
(2)Video programming provider or distributorA video programming provider or video programming distributor shall be deemed in compliance with this section and the rules and regulation promulgated thereunder if such provider or distributor enables the rendering or the pass through of closed captions and video description signals. 
(i)DefinitionsFor purposes of this section, section 303, and section 330: 
(1)Video descriptionThe term video description means the insertion of audio narrated descriptions of a television program’s key visual elements into natural pauses between the program’s dialogue. 
(2)Video programmingThe term video programming has the meaning given such term in section 602.."}
