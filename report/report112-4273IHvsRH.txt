		1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the
			 Resolving Environmental and Grid Reliability Conflicts Act of
			 2012.
		2.Amendments to the
			 Federal Power Act
			(a)Compliance with or
			 violation of environmental laws while under emergency
			 orderSection 202(c) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824a(c))
			 is amended—
				(1)by inserting
			 (1) after (c); and
				(2)by adding at the end the
			 following:
					
						(2)With respect to an order
				issued under this subsection that may result in a conflict with a requirement
				of any Federal, State, or local environmental law or regulation, the Commission
				shall ensure that such order requires generation, delivery, interchange, or
				transmission of electric energy only during hours necessary to meet the
				emergency and serve the public interest, and, to the maximum extent
				practicable, is consistent with any applicable Federal, State, or local
				environmental law or regulation and minimizes any adverse environmental
				impacts.
						(3)To the extent any
				omission or action taken by a party, that is necessary to comply with an order
				issued under this subsection, including any omission or action taken to
				voluntarily comply with such order, results in noncompliance with, or causes
				such party to not comply with, any Federal, State, or local environmental law
				or regulation, such omission or action shall not be considered a violation of
				such environmental law or regulation, or subject such party to any requirement,
				civil or criminal liability, or a citizen suit under such environmental law or
				regulation.
						(4)(A)An order issued under
				this subsection that may result in a conflict with a requirement of any
				Federal, State, or local environmental law or regulation shall expire not later
				than 90 days after it is issued. The Commission may renew or reissue such order
				pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) for subsequent periods, not to exceed 90
				days for each period, as the Commission determines necessary to meet the
				emergency and serve the public interest.
							(B)In renewing or reissuing an order under
				subparagraph (A), the Commission shall consult with the primary Federal agency
				with expertise in the environmental interest protected by such law or
				regulation, and shall include in any such renewed or reissued order such
				conditions as such Federal agency determines necessary to minimize any adverse
				environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable. The conditions, if
				any, submitted by such Federal agency shall be made available to the public.
				The Commission may exclude such a condition from the renewed or reissued order
				if it determines that such condition would prevent the order from adequately
				addressing the emergency necessitating such order and provides in the order, or
				otherwise makes publicly available, an explanation of such
				determination.
							.
				(b)Temporary connection or
			 construction by municipalitiesSection 202(d) of the Federal
			 Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824a(d)) is amended by inserting or
			 municipality before engaged in the transmission or sale of
			 electric energy.
