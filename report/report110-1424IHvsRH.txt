			(a)Extension of
			 parity to treatment limits and beneficiary financial
			 requirementsSection 712 of the Employee Retirement Income
			 Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1185a) is amended—
				(1)in subsection (a),
			 by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
					
						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services, the plan or coverage may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that are more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
							(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following four categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis and
				within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an inpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient basis
				and within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an outpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or coverage.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified under paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not
				impose such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category.
							(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services (as specified in paragraph
				(3)(C)), the plan or coverage shall apply such requirement (or, if there is
				more than one such requirement for such category of items and services, the
				predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and surgical
				benefits within such category and to mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits within such category and shall not distinguish in the
				application of such requirement between such medical and surgical benefits and
				such mental health and substance-related disorder benefits.
								(ii)Other financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause
				(i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of
				items and services, the plan or coverage may not impose such financial
				requirement on mental health and substance-related disorder benefits for items
				and services within such category in a way that is more costly to the
				participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary financial
				requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing,
				and limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or
				beneficiary with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not
				include the application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

				items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on

				benefits.

				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause
				(i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of

				participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary financial
				requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.

				requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term
				beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a plan
				or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing, and

				(1)in subsection
			 (a), by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
					
						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services, the plan or coverage may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that are more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
							(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following four categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis and
				within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an inpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient basis
				and within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an outpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or coverage.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified under paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not
				impose such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category.
							(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services (as specified in paragraph
				(3)(C)), the plan or coverage shall apply such requirement (or, if there is
				more than one such requirement for such category of items and services, the
				predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and surgical
				benefits within such category and to mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits within such category and shall not distinguish in the
				application of such requirement between such medical and surgical benefits and
				such mental health and substance-related disorder benefits.
								(ii)Other
				financial requirementsIf the
				plan or coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in
				clause (i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category
				of items and services, the plan or coverage may not impose such financial
				requirement on mental health and substance-related disorder benefits for items
				and services within such category in a way that is more costly to the
				participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary financial
				requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing,
				and limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or
				beneficiary with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not
				include the application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

				benefits—
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan does not include a treatment limit (as defined
				in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any
				category of items or services (specified in subparagraph (C)), the plan may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan includes a treatment limit on substantially all
				medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or services, the plan
				may not impose such a treatment limit on mental health or substance-related
				disorder benefits for items and services within such category that is more
				restrictive than the predominant treatment limit that is applicable to medical
				and surgical benefits for items and services within such category.
							(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following five categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into

				network of providers, required for the treatment of an emergency medical
				condition (including an emergency condition relating to mental health or
				substance-related disorders).
								(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan, limitation on the frequency of
				treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar limit on the
				duration or scope of treatment under the plan.
							(E)PredominanceFor

				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirementsIn the case of a group health plan that
				provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or

				financial requirement on mental health or substance-related disorder benefits
				for items and services within such category.
							(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan
				includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or similar
				beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to individual
				items and services on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a
				category of items and services, the plan shall apply such requirement (or, if
				there is more than one such requirement for such category of items and
				services, the predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and
				surgical benefits within such category and to mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits within such category and shall not
				distinguish in the application of such requirement between such medical and
				surgical benefits and such mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits.
								(ii)Other
				financial requirementsIf the
				plan includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause (i)
				on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items
				and services, the plan may not impose such financial requirement on mental
				health or substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category in a way that results in greater out-of-pocket expenses to the
				participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary financial
				requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(iii)ConstructionNothing in this subparagraph shall be
				construed as prohibiting the plan from waiving the application of any
				deductible for mental health benefits or substance-related disorder benefits or
				both.
								(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing, and

				of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
