				respect to a housing assistance payments contract pursuant to this
				subparagraph.
						(ix)EligibilitySubject
				only to clause (iii) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, any family
				residing in a multifamily housing project on the date of the eligibility event
				for the project who would otherwise be eligible for enhanced voucher assistance
				under subsection (t) shall be eligible for project-based voucher assistance

				paragraph shall be made available in accordance with this subparagraph for
				multifamily housing projects for which an eligibility event (as such term is
				defined in subsection (t)) occurs or has occurred and for which enhanced
				voucher assistance would otherwise be, or has been, provided under subsection
				(t). Any such assistance shall be in lieu of enhanced voucher assistance under
				subsection (t) for tenants residing in the project and shall be provided by the
				Secretary to a public housing agency.
						(ii)Request and
				provisionIf the owner of a
				multifamily housing project makes a request for project-based voucher
				assistance pursuant to this subparagraph for the project to a public housing
				agency that administers a program for assistance under subsection (o) for a
				jurisdiction within which the project is located, a contract for assistance
				under this subparagraph shall be provided with respect to the project, subject
				to clause (v).
						(iii)Timing, coverage, and
				unit rents

				eligibility eventIn the case
				of a contract for assistance under this subparagraph with respect to a project
				that is requested prior to the occurrence of the eligibility event, the
				contract for assistance shall be provided, subject to clause (v), upon the
				occurrence of the eligibility event. Such contract shall cover all dwelling
				units in the project for which enhanced voucher assistance under subsection (t)
				would otherwise be provided.
							(II)Request made after
				issuance of enhanced vouchersIn the case of a contract for
				assistance under this subparagraph with respect to a project that is requested
				after the issuance of enhanced vouchers under subsection (t) for the project,
				the contract shall be provided, subject to clause (v), as soon as possible.
				Such contract shall cover all dwelling units in the project that are occupied
				by tenants receiving such enhanced voucher assistance at the time the contract
				is effective.
							(III)Coverage of
				additional dwelling unitsAt
				the request of the owner of a multifamily housing project for which a contract
				for assistance is to be provided under this subparagraph, the public housing
				agency may contract with the owner for project-based voucher assistance under
				this subparagraph to cover additional dwelling units, if the public housing
				agency determines that such additional assistance is necessary or desirable to
				further the purposes reflected in clause (v).
							(IV)Approval of higher
				rentsAt the request of the
				owner of a multifamily housing project for a contract for assistance under this
				subparagraph to establish rents at levels above those permitted by subparagraph
				(H), a public housing agency that has made the determinations required by
				clause (v) may request, and the Secretary may approve, higher unit rents if
				necessary to preserve housing opportunities that further the purposes of clause
				(v).
							(iv)Projects in multiple
				PHA jurisdictionsIf the
				Secretary has not entered into a contract with a public housing agency to
				provide enhanced voucher assistance under subsection (t) for the project at the
				time the owner of a multifamily housing project requests assistance under this
				subparagraph, and the project is located within the jurisdiction for the
				program under subsection (o) of more than one public housing agency, in
				determining which agency will administer such assistance, the Secretary
				shall—
							(I)consider the ratio of the number of
				vouchers to be awarded under this subparagraph and of other project-based
				vouchers administered under this paragraph to the total number of vouchers
				administered by an agency; and
							(II)among other factors,
				provide preference to an agency for which the total number of project-based
				vouchers administered under this paragraph, including vouchers to be awarded
				pursuant to this subparagraph, would not exceed 50 percent of the total number
				of all vouchers to be administered by the agency after such award.
							The
				Secretary shall establish guidelines for determining which agency will
				administer assistance if a unit is not located within the jurisdiction of any
				public housing agency that administers vouchers.(v)Required
				determinationsAs a condition of entering into a contract
				pursuant to this subparagraph, the public housing agency shall have determined,
				before entering into such contract that—
							(I)the housing to be
				assisted under the contract is economically viable; and
							(II)(aa)there is a significant
				demand for the housing;
								(bb)the housing will
				contribute to a community revitalization plan or to deconcentrating poverty and
				expanding housing and economic opportunities; or
								(cc)the continued
				affordability of the housing otherwise is an important asset to the
				community.
								(vi)Inapplicability of
				goalsSubparagraph (C) shall not apply to a housing assistance
				payment contract pursuant to this subparagraph.
						(vii)Disregard of
				assistance under percentage limitationAmounts provided pursuant
				to this subparagraph shall not be considered for purposes of calculating the
				limitation under subparagraph (B).
						(viii)Inapplicability of
				income-mixing requirementSubparagraph (D) shall not apply with
				respect to a housing assistance payments contract pursuant to this
				subparagraph.
						(ix)EligibilitySubject
				only to clause (iii) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, any family
				residing in a multifamily housing project on the date of the eligibility event
				for the project who would otherwise be eligible for enhanced voucher assistance
				under subsection (t) shall be eligible for project-based voucher assistance
				pursuant to this
				subparagraph.

					37.Housing
				innovation program
						(a)PurposeThe
				purpose of the program under this section is to establish a demonstration
				program under which public housing agencies are given the flexibility to
				design, and the Secretary is given the responsibility to evaluate, innovative
				approaches to providing housing assistance that—
							(1)increase housing
				opportunities for low-, very low-, and extremely low-income families, including
				modernizing, rehabilitating, reconfiguring, or replacing public housing at risk
				of physical deterioration or obsolescence, developing additional affordable
				housing, providing supportive housing, and increasing the number of families
				receiving tenant-based rental assistance;
							(2)provide financial
				incentives and other support mechanisms to families to obtain employment and
				increase earned income, and achieve economic self-sufficiency, while protecting
				very low- and extremely low-income families from increased rent burdens;
							(3)utilize funds in a
				more effective or cost-efficient manner, including achieving energy,
				administrative, and other cost savings;
							(4)leverage other
				Federal, State, and local funding sources, including the low-income housing tax
				credit program, to expand and preserve affordable housing opportunities,
				including public housing;
							(5)test alternative
				rent-setting policies to determine whether rent determinations can be
				simplified and administrative cost savings can be realized while protecting
				extremely low- and very low-income families from increased rent burdens;
							(6)are subject to
				rigorous evaluation to test the effectiveness of such innovative approaches;
				and
							(7)are developed with
				the support of the local community and with the substantial participation of
				affected residents.
							(b)Program
				authority
							(1)ScopeThe Secretary shall carry out a housing
				innovation demonstration program under this section under which the Secretary
				may designate such number of public housing agencies to participate in the
				housing innovation demonstration program as may be necessary, in conjunction
				with agencies approved for continued program participation pursuant to
				subsection (c), to demonstrate the effectiveness of the priority strategies
				identified in subsection (d)(2). The Secretary may also designate such number
				of additional agencies to participate in the program under the terms of
				subsection (i) as may be necessary to demonstrate other innovative strategies
				as the Secretary or applicants may propose.

							(d)Additional
				agencies
							(1)Proposals;
				selection processIn addition
				to agencies participating in the program pursuant to subsection (c), the
				Secretary shall, within 12 months after such date of enactment, select public
				housing agencies to participate in the program pursuant to a competitive
				process that meets the following requirements:
								(A)Any public housing agency may be selected
				to participate in the program, except that not more than 5 agencies that are
				near-troubled under the public housing assessment system and/or section 8
				management assessment program may be selected, and except that any agency that
				is a troubled agency under either such assessment program or for which the
				Secretary has hired an alternative management entity for such agency or has
				taken possession of all or any part of such agency’s public housing program
				shall not be eligible for participation. Any near-troubled public housing
				agency participating in the program shall remain subject to the requirements of
				this Act governing tenant rent contributions, eligibility, and continued
				participation, and may not adopt policies described in subsection (e)(4)
				(relating to rents and requirements for continued occupation and
				participation).
								(B)The process provides, to the extent
				possible based on eligible agencies submitting applications and taking into
				account existing MTW agencies participating pursuant to subsection (c), for
				representation among agencies selected of agencies having various
				characteristics, including both large and small agencies, agencies serving
				urban, suburban, and rural areas, and agencies in various geographical regions
				throughout the United States, and which may include the selection of agencies
				that only administer the voucher program under section 8(o).
								(C)Any agency
				submitting a proposal under this paragraph shall have provided notice to
				residents and the local community, not later than 30 days before the first of
				the two public meetings required under subparagraph (D).
								(D)The agency
				submitting a proposal shall hold two public meetings to receive comments on the
				agency’s proposed application, on the implications of changes under the
				proposal, and the possible impact on residents.
								(E)The process
				includes criteria for selection, as follows:
									(i)The extent to
				which—
										(I)if proposal is for
				the purpose of carrying out the priority strategy under subsection (d)(2)(A),
				the proposal is likely to achieve the purposes of increasing housing
				opportunities for low-, very low-, and extremely low-income families, including
				modernizing, rehabilitating, reconfiguring, or replacing public housing at risk
				of physical deterioration or obsolescence, developing additional affordable
				housing, providing supportive housing, or increasing the number of families
				receiving tenant-based rental assistance, or a combination of these
				purposes;
										(II)if the proposal is for the purpose of
				carrying out the priority strategy under subsection (d)(2)(B), the proposal is
				likely to achieve the purposes of families obtaining employment, increasing
				earned income, or achieving economic self-sufficiency, while protecting
				extremely low- and very low-income families from increased rent burdens;
				or
										(III)if the proposal
				is for the purpose of carrying out an innovative strategy pursuant to the last
				sentence of subsection (b)(1), the proposal is likely to achieve the goals and
				objectives of such strategy.
										(ii)The extent to
				which the proposal generally identifies statutory provisions and existing rules
				and regulations that impede achievement of the goals and objectives of the
				proposal and an explanation of why a waiver of such statutory provisions,
				rules, and regulations is necessary to achieve such goals and
				objectives.
									(iii)The extent to
				which the agency has a successful history of implementing or has expertise in
				strategies similar to those set forth in the agency’s proposal.
									(iv)The extent of
				commitment and funding for carrying out the proposal by local and State
				government agencies and nonprofit organizations, including the provision of
				additional funding and other services, and the extent of support for the
				proposal by residents, resident advisory boards, and members of the local
				community.
									(v)Such other factors
				as the Secretary may establish, in consultation with participating agencies and
				agencies interested in participating in the program, program stakeholders, and
				any entity conducting evaluations pursuant to subsection (f), which may include
				the extent to which the proposal is likely to result in utilization of funds in
				a more effective or cost-efficient manner, including achieving energy,
				administrative, and other cost savings.
									(2)Priority
				strategiesFor purposes of the first sentence of paragraph
				(b)(1), the following are priority strategies:
								(A)Increasing
				housing opportunitiesA
				strategy of development of increasing housing opportunities for low-, very
				low-, and extremely low-income families, including modernizing, rehabilitating,
				reconfiguring, or replacing public housing at risk of physical deterioration or
				obsolescence, developing additional affordable housing, providing supportive
				housing, or increasing the number of families receiving tenant-based rental
				assistance, or a combination of these purposes.
								(B)Rent reforms and
				family self-sufficiencyA strategy to implement rent reforms and
				other self-sufficiency incentives or resources, which shall be designed to help
				families obtain employment, increase their earned income, or achieve economic
				self-sufficiency, while protecting extremely low- and very low-income families
				from increased rent burdens.
								(3)Contract
				amendmentAfter selecting
				agencies under this subsection, the Secretary shall promptly amend the
				applicable annual contributions contracts of such agencies to provide
				that—
								(A)subject to
				subparagraph (B), such agencies may implement only such policies and activities
				that are necessary to carry out the priority strategy or innovative strategy or
				strategies included in the application for participation in the program,
				without specifying such policies and activities in such amendment and without
				negotiating or entering into any other agreements with the Secretary specifying
				such policies and activities; and
								(B)the activities to
				be implemented by an agency under the program in a given year shall be
				described in and subject to the requirements of the annual plan under
				subsection (e)(8).
								(e)Program
				requirements
							(1)Program
				funds
								(A)In
				generalTo the extent
				necessary to carry out a housing innovation program under this section, the
				participating agency may use amounts provided to the agency from the Operating
				Fund under section 9(e), amounts provided to the agency from the Capital Fund
				under section 9(d), and amounts provided to the agency for voucher assistance
				under section 8(o). Such program funds may be used for any activities that are
				authorized by section 8(o) or 9, or for other activities that are not
				inconsistent with this section, which may include, without limitation—
									(i)providing capital
				and operating assistance, and financing for housing previously developed or
				operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and such agency;
									(ii)the acquisition,
				new construction, rehabilitation, financing, and provision of capital or
				operating assistance for low-income housing (including housing other than
				public housing) and related facilities, which may be for terms exceeding the
				term of the program under this section in order to secure other financing for
				such housing;
									(iii)costs of site
				acquisition and improvement, providing utility services, demolition, planning,
				and administration of activities under this paragraph;
									(iv)housing
				counseling for low-income families in connection with rental or homeownership
				assistance provided under the program;
									(v)safety, security,
				law enforcement, and anticrime activities appropriate to protect and support
				families assisted under the program;
									(vi)tenant-based
				rental assistance, which may include the project-basing of such assistance;
				and
									(vii)appropriate and
				reasonable financial assistance that is required to preserve low-income housing
				otherwise assisted under programs administered by the Secretary or under State
				or local low-income housing or public housing programs.
									(B)Combining
				fundsNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a participating
				agency may combine and use program funds for any activities authorized under
				this section, except that a participating agency may use funds provided for
				assistance under section 8(o) for activities other than those authorized under
				section 8(o) only if (i) in the calendar year prior to its participation in the
				program, the agency utilized not less than 95 percent of such funds allocated
				for that calendar year for such authorized activities or 95 percent of its
				authorized vouchers; or (ii) after approval to participate in the program, the
				agency achieves such utilization for a 12-month period. Such limitation shall
				not apply to participating agencies approved by the Secretary to combine funds
				from sections 8 and 9 of the Act prior to enactment of this section. A public
				housing agency that uses funds provided from assistance under section 8(o) for
				activities not authorized under such subsection may not terminate assistance to
				families assisted under such subsection on the grounds of inadequate funding to
				the extent such inadequacy is caused by such use of funds for purposes not
				authorized under section 8(o).
								(2)Use of program
				fundsIn carrying out the housing innovation program under this
				section, each participating agency shall continue to assist—
								(A)not less than 98
				percent of the number of eligible low-income families under the program as it
				assisted in the base year for the agency; and
								(B)a comparable mix
				of families by family size, subject to adjustment to reflect changes in the
				agency’s waiting list, except that the Secretary may approve exceptions to such
				requirements for up to 3 years based on modernization or redevelopment
				activities proposed in an annual plan submitted and approved in accordance with
				paragraph (11).
								Determinations with respect to the
				number of families required to be served shall be adjusted to reflect any
				allocation of additional vouchers under section 8(o), any change in annual
				voucher proration factor, or such other appropriate adjustments as the
				Secretary may establish. For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term base
				year means, with respect to existing MTW agencies, the first full
				calendar year prior to approval and transfer, pursuant to subsection (c)(2),
				into the housing innovation program under this section. The Secretary shall
				monitor and enforce compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (A) on an
				annual basis.(3)Retained
				provisionsEach agency that is approved to carry out one of the
				two priority strategies identified in subsection (d)(2) shall comply with all
				provisions of this Act except those that are necessary to carry out one of such
				two priority strategies. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
				families receiving assistance under this section shall retain the same rights
				of judicial review of agency action as they would otherwise have had if the
				agency were not participating in the program, and each participating agency,
				including existing MTW agencies, shall comply with the following provisions of

				both with program funds and low-income housing tax credits, the initial lease
				term may be less than 12 months if required to conform lease terms with such
				tax credit requirements.
								(I)Section 7 (relating to designation of
				housing for elderly and disabled households), except that a participating
				agency may make such designations (at initial designation or upon renewal) for
				a term of up to 5 years if the agency includes in its annual plan under
				paragraph (11) an analysis of the impact of such designations on affected
				households and such designation is subject to the program evaluation. Any
				participating agency with a designated housing plan that was approved under the
				moving to work demonstration may continue to operate under the terms of such
				plan for a term of 5 years (with an option to renew on the same terms for an
				additional 5 years) if it includes in its annual plan an analysis of the impact
				of such designations on affected households and is subject to evaluation under
				subsection (f).
								(J)Subparagraphs (C) through (E) of section
				8(o)(7) and section 8(o)(20) (relating to lease requirements and eviction

				substituting 50 percent for 20 percent, and all
				voucher funding that is used for non-tenant based assistance purposes shall
				count towards this calculation.
								(L)Section 8(o)(13)(E) (relating to resident
				choice for tenants of units with project-based vouchers), except with respect
				to—

				under this subparagraph, an agency may not eliminate resident choice under
				section 8(o)(13)(E) for more than 25 percent of its authorized vouchers.(M)Section 8(r)

				agency may receive funding for portability obligations under section 8(dd) in
				the same manner as other public housing agencies.

				that—
								(A)subject to compliance
				with all program rules under this section, such agencies may implement any
				policies and activities that are not inconsistent with this section, without
				specifying such policies and activities in such amendment and without
				negotiating or entering into any other agreements with the Secretary specifying
				such policies and activities; and
								(B)the policies and
				activities to be implemented by an agency under the program in a given year
				shall be described in and subject to the requirements of the annual plan under
				subsection (e)(11).
								(4)Maintaining
				participation rateIf, at any time after the initial selection
				period under paragraph (1), the number of public housing agencies participating
				in the program falls below the number selected pursuant to paragraph (1), the
				Secretary shall promptly solicit applications from and select public housing
				agencies to participate in the program under the terms and conditions for
				application and selection provided in this section to increase the number of
				participating agencies to the number initially selected pursuant to paragraph
				(1).
							(e)Program
				requirements
							(1)Program funds
								(A)In
				generalTo carry out a
				housing innovation program under this section, the participating agency may use
				amounts provided to the agency from the Operating Fund under section 9(e),
				amounts provided to the agency from the Capital Fund under section 9(d), and
				amounts provided to the agency for voucher assistance under section 8(o). Such
				program funds may be used for any activities that are authorized by section
				8(o) or 9, or for other activities that are not inconsistent with this section,
				which may include, without limitation—
									(i)providing capital and
				operating assistance, and financing for housing previously developed or
				operated pursuant to a contract between the Secretary and such agency;
									(ii)the acquisition, new
				construction, rehabilitation, financing, and provision of capital or operating
				assistance for low-income housing (including housing other than public housing)
				and related facilities, which may be for terms exceeding the term of the
				program under this section in order to secure other financing for such
				housing;
									(iii)costs of site
				acquisition and improvement, providing utility services, demolition, planning,
				and administration of activities under this paragraph;
									(iv)housing counseling for
				low-income families in connection with rental or homeownership assistance
				provided under the program;
									(v)safety, security, law
				enforcement, and anticrime activities appropriate to protect and support
				families assisted under the program;
									(vi)tenant-based rental
				assistance, which may include the project-basing of such assistance;
									(vii)appropriate and
				reasonable financial assistance that is required to preserve low-income housing
				otherwise assisted under programs administered by the Secretary or under State
				or local low-income housing or public housing programs; and
									(viii)family
				self-sufficiency activities for low-income families in connection with rental
				or homeownership assistance provided under the program.
									(B)Combining
				fundsNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a participating
				agency may combine and use program funds for any activities authorized under
				this section, except that a participating agency may use funds provided for
				assistance under section 8(o) for activities other than those authorized under
				section 8(o) only if (i) in the calendar year prior to its participation in the
				program, the agency utilized not less than 95 percent of such funds allocated
				for that calendar year for such authorized activities or 95 percent of its
				authorized vouchers; or (ii) after approval to participate in the program, the
				agency achieves such utilization for a 12-month period. Such limitation shall
				not apply to participating agencies approved by the Secretary to combine funds
				from sections 8 and 9 of the Act prior to enactment of this section. A public
				housing agency that uses funds provided from assistance under section 8(o) for
				activities not authorized under such subsection may not terminate assistance to
				families assisted under such subsection on the grounds of inadequate funding to
				the extent such inadequacy is caused by such use of funds for purposes not
				authorized under section 8(o).
								(2)Use of program
				fundsIn carrying out the housing innovation program under this
				section, each participating agency shall continue to assist—
								(A)not less than
				substantially the same number of eligible low-income families under the program
				as it assisted in the base year for the agency; and
								(B)a comparable mix of
				families by family size, subject to adjustment to reflect changes in the
				agency’s waiting list, except that the Secretary may approve exceptions to such
				requirements for up to 3 years based on modernization or redevelopment
				activities proposed in an annual plan submitted and approved in accordance with
				paragraph (11).
								Determinations with respect to the number
				of families required to be served shall be adjusted to reflect any allocation
				of additional vouchers under section 8(o), any change in annual voucher
				proration factor, or such other appropriate adjustments as the Secretary may
				establish. For purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), the term base
				year means, with respect to existing MTW agencies, the first full
				calendar year prior to approval for entry into the moving to work
				demonstration. The Secretary shall monitor and enforce compliance with the
				requirements of subparagraph (A) on an annual basis.(3)Retained
				provisionsEach agency that is approved for program participation
				pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) shall comply with all
				provisions of this Act except those statutory provisions and existing rules and
				regulations generally identified in the application for participation in the
				program, except that the Secretary may approve requests by an agency to waive
				compliance with other statutes, regulations, and rules pursuant to this Act,
				consistent with other program rules, if the Secretary determines that such a
				request would further the goals and objectives identified in the application
				for participation in the program (taking into consideration public and resident
				input pursuant to the procedure under paragraph (4)) or would further the
				purposes identified in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (f)(1).
				Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, families receiving
				assistance under this section shall retain the same rights of judicial review
				of agency action as they would otherwise have had if the agency were not
				participating in the program, and each participating agency, including existing
				MTW agencies that are approved for transfer into the program pursuant to
				subsection (c), shall comply with the following provisions of this Act:

				grievance procedures for public housing tenants) and comparable procedural
				rights for families assisted under section 8(o).

				program funds and low-income housing tax credits, the initial lease term may be
				less than 12 months if required to conform lease terms with such tax credit
				requirements.
								(I)Section 7 (relating to designation of
				housing for elderly and disabled households), except that a participating
				agency may make such designations (at initial designation or upon renewal) for
				a term of up to 5 years if the agency includes in its annual plan under
				paragraph (11) an analysis of the impact of such designations on affected
				households and such designation is subject to the program evaluation. Any
				participating agency with a designated housing plan that was approved under the
				moving to work demonstration may continue to operate under the terms of such
				plan for a term of 5 years (with an option to renew on the same terms for an
				additional 5 years) if it includes in its annual plan an analysis of the impact
				of such designations on affected households and is subject to evaluation under
				subsection (f).
								(J)Subparagraphs (C) through (E) of section
				8(o)(7) and section 8(o)(20) (relating to lease requirements and eviction

				funding that is used for non-tenant based assistance purposes shall count
				towards this calculation.
								(L)Section 8(o)(13)(E) (relating to resident
				choice for tenants of units with project-based vouchers), except with respect
				to—

				following actions:
									(i)The agency shall conduct
				an impact analysis of the proposed policy on families the agency is assisting
				under the program under this section and on applicants on the waiting list,
