(a)AuthorityNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (in this section referred to as the Secretary) may increase the dollar amount limitations on the principal obligation of mortgages otherwise determined under section 203(b)(2) of the National Housing Act for any county that is designated under this section. 
(b)Procedure 
(1)Federal register noticeAny designation of a county under this section shall be made only pursuant to application by the county for such designation, in accordance with procedures that the Secretary may establish. The Secretary may establish such procedures only by publication in the Federal Register not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
(2)Final determinationIf the Secretary establishes procedures for applications under paragraph (1) and receives a completed application for designation under this section of a county in accordance with such procedures, the Secretary shall issue a final determination regarding such application for designation, based on the criteria under subsection (c), not later than 60 days after such receipt. 
(c)Determination criteriaThe Secretary may designate an applicant county under this section only if the county is located within a micropolitan area (as such term is defined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget) and meets the following criteria: 
(1)More than 70 percent of the border of the applicant county abuts two or more metropolitan statistical areas (as such term is defined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget) for which each dollar amount limitation on the principal obligation of a mortgage that may be insured under section 203 of the National Housing Act, in effect at the time of such determination, is at least 40 percent greater than the dollar amount limitation for the same size residence for the applicant county. For purposes of such calculation, the dollar amount limitations of such abutting counties shall not include any increase attributable to the authority under this section. 
(2)The applicant county has experienced significant population growth, as evidenced by an increase of 15 percent or more during the 10 years preceding the application, according to statistics of the United States Census Bureau or such other appropriate criteria as the Secretary shall establish. 
(3)The dollar amount limitation on the principal obligation of a mortgage on housing in the applicant county that may be insured under section 203 of the National Housing Act, in effect at the time of such application, is the minimum such dollar amount limitation allowable under the matter that follows clause (ii) in section 203(b)(2)(A) of the National Housing Act. 
(d)Establishment of loan limitsFor a county designated under this section, the Secretary may increase the maximum dollar amount limitations on the principal obligation of mortgages otherwise determined under section 203(b)(2) of the National Housing Act to such levels as are appropriate, taking into consideration the criteria established for such designation, but not to exceed the dollar amount limitations for the abutting metropolitan statistical area meeting the requirements of subsection (c)(1) that has the lowest such dollar amount limitations.  
(e)Effective date and term of designation of new countywide loan limitsA designation of a county under this section, and the maximum dollar amount limitations for such county pursuant to subsection (d), shallâ€” 
(1)take effect upon the expiration of the 60-day period that begins upon the final determination for the county referred to in subsection (b)(2); and 
(2)remain in effect until the end of the calendar year in which such designation takes effect. 
(f)Loan limits for succeeding yearsWith respect to each calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which a county is designated under this subsection, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, continue or adjust the dollar amount limitations in effect pursuant to this section for such designated county for such preceding year, as appropriate, consistent with the criteria under this section."}
