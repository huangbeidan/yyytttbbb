(3)Coordination of regional planning entitiesThe Commission shall encourage regional planning entities described under paragraph (2) to cooperate and coordinate across regions and to harmonize regional electric grid planning with planning in adjacent or overlapping jurisdictions to the maximum extent feasible. The Commission shall work with States, public utilities transmission providers, load-serving entities, transmission operators, and other organizations to resolve any conflict or competition among proposed planning entities in order to build consensus and promote the Federal policy established under subsection (a). The Commission shall seek to ensure that planning that is consistent with the national electricity grid planning principles adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) is conducted in all regions of the United States and the territories. 
(4)Relation to existing planning policyIn implementing the Federal policy established under subsection (a), the Commission shall— 
(A)incorporate any ongoing planning efforts undertaken pursuant to section 217; and

(A)In generalThe Commission shall provide support to and participate in the regional grid planning processes conducted by regional planning entities. The Commission may provide planning resources and assistance as required or as requested by regional planning entities, including system data, cost information, system analysis, technical expertise, modeling support, dispute resolution services, and other assistance to regional planning entities, as appropriate. 
(B)AuthorizationThere are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.  
(6)Conflict resolutionIn the event that regional grid plans conflict, the Commission shall assist the regional planning entities in resolving such conflicts in order to achieve the objectives of the Federal policy established under subsection (a). 
(7)Submission of plansThe Commission shall require regional planning entities to submit initial regional electric grid plans to the Commission not later than 18 months after the date the Commission promulgates national electricity grid planning principles pursuant to paragraph (1). Regional electric grid plans should, in general, be developed from sub-regional requirements and plans, including planning input reflecting individual utility service areas. Regional plans may then in turn be combined into larger regional plans, up to interconnection-wide and national plans, as appropriate and necessary as determined by the Commission. The Commission shall review such plans for consistency with the national grid planning principles and may return a plan to one or more planning entities for further consideration, along with the Commission’s own recommendations for resolution of any conflict or for improvement. To the extent practicable, all plans submitted to the Commission shall be public documents and available on the Commission’s website. 
(8)Multi-regional meetingsAs regional grid plans are submitted to the Commission, the Commission may convene multi-regional meetings to discuss regional grid plan consistency and integration, including requirements for multi-regional projects, and to resolve any conflicts that emerge from such multi-regional projects. The Commission shall provide its recommendations for eliminating any inter-regional conflicts. 
(9)Report to congressNot later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this section, the Commission shall provide a report to Congress containing the results of the regional grid planning process, including summaries of the adopted regional plans. The Commission shall provide an electronic version of its report on its website with links to all regional and sub-regional plans taken into account. The Commission shall note and provide its recommended resolution for any conflicts not resolved during the planning process. The Commission shall make any recommendations to Congress on the appropriate Federal role or support required to address the needs of the electric grid, including recommendations for addressing any needs that are beyond the reach of existing State and Federal authority."}

(1)Planning principlesNot later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the Commission shall adopt, after notice and opportunity for comment, national electricity grid planning principles derived from the Federal policy established under subsection (a) to be applied in ongoing and future transmission planning that may implicate interstate transmission of electricity. 
(2)Regional planning entitiesNot later than 3 months after the date of adoption by the Commission of national electricity grid planning principles pursuant to paragraph (1), entities that conduct or may conduct transmission planning pursuant to State, tribal, or Federal law or regulation, including States, Indian tribes, entities designated by States and Indian tribes, Federal Power Marketing Administrations, transmission providers, operators and owners, regional organizations, and electric utilities, and that are willing to incorporate the national electricity grid planning principles adopted by the Commission in their electric grid planning, shall identify themselves and the regions for which they propose to develop plans to the Commission. 
(3)Coordination of regional planning entitiesThe Commission shall encourage regional planning entities described under paragraph (2) to cooperate and coordinate across regions and to harmonize regional electric grid planning with planning in adjacent or overlapping jurisdictions to the maximum extent feasible. The Commission shall work with States, Indian tribes, Federal land management agencies, State energy, environment, natural resources, and land management agencies and commissions, Federal power marketing administrations, electric utilities, transmission providers, load-serving entities, transmission operators, regional transmission organizations, independent system operators, and other organizations to resolve any conflict or competition among proposed planning entities in order to build consensus and promote the Federal policy established under subsection (a). The Commission shall seek to ensure that planning that is consistent with the national electricity grid planning principles adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) is conducted in all regions of the United States and the territories, but in a manner that, to the extent feasible, avoids uncoordinated planning by more than one planning entity for the same area. 
(4)Relation to existing planning policyIn implementing the Federal policy established under subsection (a), the Commission shall— 
(A)incorporate and coordinate with any ongoing planning efforts undertaken pursuant to section 217 and Commission Order No. 890; 
(B)coordinate with the Secretary of Energy in providing to the regional planning entities an annual summary of national energy policy priorities and goals;  
(C)coordinate with corridor designation and planning functions carried out pursuant to section 216 by the Secretary of Energy, who shall provide financial support from available funds to support the purposes of this section; and 
(D)coordinate with the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture and Indian tribes in carrying out the Secretaries’ or tribal governments’ existing responsibilities for the planning or siting of transmission facilities on Federal or tribal lands, consistent with law, policy, and regulations relating to the management of federal public lands. 
(5)Assistance 
(A)In generalThe Commission shall provide support to and may participate if invited to do so in the regional grid planning processes conducted by regional planning entities. The Secretary of Energy and the Commission may provide planning resources and assistance as required or as requested by regional planning entities, including system data, cost information, system analysis, technical expertise, modeling support, dispute resolution services, and other assistance to regional planning entities, as appropriate. 
(B)AuthorizationThere are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph. 
(6)Conflict resolutionIn the event that regional grid plans conflict, the Commission shall assist the regional planning entities in resolving such conflicts in order to achieve the objectives of the Federal policy established under subsection (a). 
(7)Submission of plansThe Commission shall require regional planning entities to submit initial regional electric grid plans to the Commission not later than 18 months after the date the Commission promulgates national electricity grid planning principles pursuant to paragraph (1), with updates to such plans not less than every 3 years thereafter. The Commission shall review such plans for consistency with the national grid planning principles and may return a plan to one or more planning entities for further consideration, along with the Commission’s own recommendations for resolution of any conflict or for improvement. 
(8)Integration of plansRegional electric grid plans should, in general, be developed from sub-regional requirements and plans, including planning input reflecting individual utility service areas. Regional plans may then in turn be combined into larger regional plans, up to interconnection-wide and national plans, as appropriate and necessary as determined by the Commission. In no case shall a multi-regional plan impose inclusion of a facility on a region that has submitted a valid plan that, after efforts to resolve the conflict, does not include such facility. To the extent practicable, all plans submitted to the Commission shall be public documents and available on the Commission’s Web site. 
(9)Multi-regional meetingsAs regional grid plans are submitted to the Commission, the Commission may convene multi-regional meetings to discuss regional grid plan consistency and integration, including requirements for multi-regional projects, and to resolve any conflicts that emerge from such multi-regional projects. The Commission shall provide its recommendations for eliminating any inter-regional conflicts. 
(10)Report to congressNot later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this section and each 3 years thereafter, the Commission shall provide a report to Congress containing the results of the regional grid planning process, including summaries of the adopted regional plans and the extent to which the Federal policy objectives in subsection (a) have been successfully achieved. The Commission shall provide an electronic version of its report on its website with links to all regional and sub-regional plans taken into account. The Commission shall note and provide its recommended resolution for any conflicts not resolved during the planning process. The Commission shall make any recommendations to Congress on the appropriate Federal role or support required to address the needs of the electric grid, including recommendations for addressing any needs that are beyond the reach of existing State, tribal, and Federal authority. 
216B.Siting and construction in the Western Interconnection 
(a)ApplicabilityThis section applies only to States located in the Western Interconnection and does not apply to States located in the Eastern Interconnection, to the States of Alaska or Hawaii, or to ERCOT. 
(b)Certificate of public convenience and necessityThe Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the construction or modification of a transmission facility if the Commission finds that—

(B)Application 
(i)Application criteriaThis subparagraph applies to each lamp that— 
(I)is intended for a general service or general illumination application (whether incandescent or not); 
(II)has a medium screw base or any other screw base not defined in ANSI C81.61–2006; 
(III)is capable of being operated at a voltage at least partially within the range of 110 to 130 volts; and 
(IV)is manufactured or imported after December 31, 2011. 
(ii)RequirementFor purposes of this paragraph, each lamp described in clause (i) shall have a color rendering index that is greater than or equal to— 
(I)80 for nonmodified spectrum lamps; or 
(II)75 for modified spectrum lamps. 
(C)Candelabra incandescent lamps and intermediate base incandescent lamps 
(i)Candelabra base incandescent lampsEffective beginning January 1, 2012, a candelabra base incandescent lamp shall not exceed 60 rated watts. 
(ii)Intermediate base incandescent lampsEffective beginning January 1, 2012, an intermediate base incandescent lamp shall not exceed 40 rated watts. 
(D)Exemptions 
(i)Statutory exemptionsThe standards specified in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the following types of incandescent reflector lamps: 
(I)Lamps rated at 50 watts or less that are ER30, BR30, BR40, or ER40 lamps. 
(II)Lamps rated at 65 watts that are BR30, BR40, or ER40 lamps. 
(III)R20 incandescent reflector lamps rated 45 watts or less. 
(ii)Administrative exemptions 
(I)PetitionAny person may petition the Secretary for an exemption for a type of general service lamp from the requirements of this subsection. 
(II)CriteriaThe Secretary may grant an exemption under subclause (I) only to the extent that the Secretary finds, after a hearing and opportunity for public comment, that it is not technically feasible to serve a specialized lighting application (such as a military, medical, public safety, or certified historic lighting application) using a lamp that meets the requirements of this subsection. 
(III)Additional criterionTo grant an exemption for a product under this clause, the Secretary shall include, as an additional criterion, that the exempted product is unlikely to be used in a general service lighting application. 
(E)Extension of coverage 
(i)PetitionAny person may petition the Secretary to establish standards for lamp shapes or bases that are excluded from the definition of general service lamps. 
(ii)Increased sales of exempted lampsThe petition shall include evidence that the availability or sales of exempted incandescent lamps have increased significantly since the date on which the standards on general service incandescent lamps were established. 
(iii)CriteriaThe Secretary shall grant a petition under clause (i) if the Secretary finds that—

These regulations shall provide the following: 
(1)AmountThe Administrator shall place in the small business refiner reserve account allowances that are to be sold at auction pursuant to the allocations in section 782 in an amount equal to— 
(A)6.2 percent of the emission allowances established under section 721(a) for each vintage year from 2012 through 2013;

(C)4.9 percent of the emission allowances established under section 721(a) for each vintage year from 2016 through 2024. 
(2)Allowed purchasesFrom January 1 of the calendar year that matches the vintage year for which allowances have been placed in the reserve, through January 14 of the following year, small business refiners (as defined in section 787(b)) may purchase allowances from this reserve at the price determined pursuant to paragraph (3). 
(3)PriceThe price for allowances purchased from this reserve shall be the average auction price for allowances of the same vintage year purchased at auctions conducted pursuant to this section during the 12 months preceding the purchase of the allowances. 
(4)Use of allowancesAllowances purchased from this reserve shall only be used by the purchaser to demonstrate compliance pursuant to section 722 for attributable greenhouse gas emissions in the calendar year that matches the vintage year of the purchased allowance. Allowances purchased from this reserve may not be banked, traded or borrowed. 
(5)Limitations on purchase amountThe Administrator, by regulation adopted after public notice and an opportunity for comment, shall establish procedures to distribute the ability to purchase allowances from the reserve fairly among all small business refiners interested in purchasing allowances from this reserve so as to address the potential that requests to purchase allowances exceed the number of allowances available in the reserve. This regulation may place limits on the number of allowances a small business refiner may purchase from the reserve. 
(6)Unsold allowancesVintage year allowances not sold from the reserve on or before January 15 of the calendar year following the vintage year shall be sold at an auction conducted pursuant to this section no later than March 31 of the calendar year following the vintage year. If significantly more allowances are being placed in the reserve than are being purchased from the reserve several years in a row, the Administrator may adjust either the percent of allowances placed in the reserve or the date by which allowances may be purchased from the reserve.

(a)In generalEmission allowances allocated pursuant to section 782(t) shall be distributed by the Administrator in accordance with this section. Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this title, the Administrator shall issue regulations allowing— 
(1)any person in the United States to exchange instruments in the nature of offset credits issued before January 1, 2009, by a State or voluntary offset program with respect to which the Administrator has made an affirmative determination under section 740(a)(2), for emissions allowances established by the Administrator under section 721(a); and 
(2)the Administrator to provide compensation in the form of emission allowances to entities that do not meet the criteria of paragraph (1) and meet the criteria of this paragraph for documented early reductions or avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions or greenhouse gases sequestered before January 1, 2009, from projects begun before January 1, 2009, where— 
(A)the entity publicly stated greenhouse gas reduction goals and publicly reported against those goals; 
(B)the entity demonstrated entity-wide net greenhouse gas reductions; and 
(C)the entity demonstrates the actual projects undertaken to make reductions and documents the reductions (e.g., through documentation of engineering projects). 
(b)RegulationsRegulations issued under subsection (a) shall— 
(1)provide that a person exchanging credits under subsection (a)(1) receive emission allowances established under section 721(a) in an amount for which the monetary value is equivalent to the average monetary value of the credits during the period from January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2009, as adjusted for inflation to reflect current dollar values at the time of the exchange; 
(2)provide that a person receiving compensation for documented early action under subsection (a)(2) shall receive emission allowances established under section 721(a) in an amount that is approximately equivalent in value to the carbon dioxide equivalent per ton value received by entities in exchange for credits under paragraph (1) (as adjusted for inflation to reflect current dollar values at the time of the exchange), as determined by the Administrator; 
(3)provide that only reductions or avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, or sequestration of greenhouse gases, achieved by activities in the United States between January 1, 2001, and January 1, 2009, may be compensated under this section, and only credits issued for such activities may be exchanged under this section; 
(4)provide that only credits that have not been retired or otherwise used to meet a voluntary or mandatory commitment, and have not expired, may be exchanged under subsection (a)(1); 
(5)require that, once exchanged, the credit be retired for purposes of use under the program by or for which it was originally issued; and 
(6)establish a deadline by which persons must exchange the credits or request compensation for early action under this section. 
(c)ParticipationParticipation in an exchange of credits for allowances or compensation for early action authorized by this section shall not preclude any person from participation in an offset credit program established under the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. 
(d)DistributionOf the emission allowances distributed under this section, a quantity equal to 0.75 percent of vintage year 2012 emission allowances established under section 721(a) shall be distributed pursuant to subsection (a)(1), and a quantity equal to 0.25 percent of vintage year 2012 emission allowances established under section 721(a) shall be distributed pursuant to subsection (a)(2)."}

(A)Eligibility criteriaAn owner or operator of an entity shall be eligible to receive emission allowance rebates under this subpart if such entity is in an industrial sector that is included in a six-digit classification of the NAICS that meets the criteria in both clauses (i) and (ii), or the criteria in clause (iii). 
(i)Energy or greenhouse gas intensityAs determined by the Administrator, the industrial sector had— 
(I)an energy intensity of at least 5 percent, calculated by dividing the cost of purchased electricity and fuel costs of the sector by the value of the shipments of the sector, based on data described in subparagraph (E); or 
(II)a greenhouse gas intensity of at least 5 percent, calculated by dividing— 
(aa)the number 20 multiplied by the number of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions (including direct emissions from fuel combustion, process emissions, and indirect emissions from the generation of electricity used to produce the output of the sector) of the sector based on data described in subparagraph (E); by 
(bb)the value of the shipments of the sector, based on data described in subparagraph (E). 
(ii)Trade intensityAs determined by the Administrator, the industrial sector had a trade intensity of at least 15 percent, calculated by dividing the value of the total imports and exports of such sector by the value of the shipments plus the value of imports of such sector, based on data described in subparagraph (E). 
(iii)Very high energy or greenhouse gas intensityAs determined by the Administrator, the industrial sector had an energy or greenhouse gas intensity, as calculated under clause (i)(I) or (II), of at least 20 percent. 
(B)Iron and steel sectorFor purposes of this subpart, in carrying out this section and section 765, the Administrator shall consider as in different industrial sectors— 
(i)entities using integrated iron and steelmaking technologies (including coke ovens, blast furnaces, and other iron-making technologies); and 
(ii)entities using electric arc furnace technologies. 
(C)Metal and phosphate production classified under more than one naics codeFor purposes of this subpart, in carrying out this section and section 765, the Administrator shall— 
(i)aggregate data for the beneficiation or other processing of iron and copper ores and phosphate with subsequent steps in the process of metal and phosphate manufacturing regardless of the NAICS code under which such activity is classified; and 
(ii)aggregate data for the manufacturing of steel with the manufacturing of steel pipe and tube made from purchased steel in a nonintegrated process. 
(D)ExclusionThe petroleum refining sector shall not be an eligible industrial sector. 
(E)Data sources 
(i)Electricity and fuel costs, value of shipmentsThe Administrator shall determine electricity and fuel costs and the value of shipments under this subsection from data from the United States Census of Mineral Industries and the United States Census Annual Survey of Manufacturers. The Administrator shall take the average of data from as many of the years of 2004, 2005, and 2006 for which such data are available. If such data are unavailable, the Administrator shall make a determination based upon 2002 or 2006 data from the most detailed industrial classification level of Energy Information Agency’s Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (using 2006 data if it is available) and the 2002 or 2007 Economic Census of the United States (using 2007 data if it is available). If data from the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey are unavailable for any sector at the six-digit classification level in the NAICS, then the Administrator may extrapolate the information necessary to determine the eligibility of a sector under this paragraph from available Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey data pertaining to a broader industrial category classified in the NAICS. Fuel cost data shall not include the cost of fuel used as feedstock by an industrial sector. 
(ii)Imports and exportsThe Administrator shall base the value of imports and exports under this subsection on United States International Trade Commission data. The Administrator shall take the average of data from as many of the years of 2004, 2005, and 2006 for which such data are available. 
(iii)PercentagesThe Administrator shall round the energy intensity, greenhouse gas intensity, and trade intensity percentages under subparagraph (A) to the nearest whole number. 
(iv)Greenhouse gas emission calculationsWhen calculating the tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions for each sector under subparagraph (A)(i)(II)(aa), the Administrator— 
(I)shall use the best available data from as many of the years 2004, 2005, and 2006 for which such data is available; and 
(II)may, to the extent necessary with respect to a sector, use economic and engineering models and the best available information on technology performance levels for such sector."}

(I)represent a subsector of a six-digit section of the NAICS code; and 
(II)meet the eligibility criteria in both clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2)(A), or the eligibility criteria in clause (iii) of paragraph (2)(A). 
(ii)DataIn making a determination under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall consider data submitted by the petitioner that is specific to the entity, data solicited by the Administrator from other entities in the subsector, if such other entities exist, and data specified in paragraph (2)(E). 
(iii)Basis of subsector determinationThe Administrator shall determine an entity or group of entities to be a subsector of a six-digit section of the NAICS code based only upon the products manufactured and not the industrial process by which the products are manufactured, except that the Administrator may determine an entity or group of entities that manufacture a product from a virgin material to be a separate subsector from another entity or group of entities that manufacture the same product from recycled material. 
(iv)Final actionThe Administrator shall take final action on such petition no later than 6 months after the petition is received by the Administrator.  
(B)Updated trade intensity dataThe Administrator shall designate as eligible to receive emission allowance rebates under this subpart an industrial sector that— 
(i)met the energy or greenhouse gas intensity criteria in paragraph (2)(A)(i) as of the date of promulgation of the rule under paragraph (1); and 
(ii)meets the trade intensity criteria in paragraph (2)(A)(ii), using data from any year after 2006. 
(C)Use of most recent dataIn determining whether to designate a sector or subsector as an eligible industrial sector under this paragraph, the Administrator shall use the most recent data available from the sources described in paragraph (2)(E), rather than the data from the years specified in paragraph (2)(E), to determine the trade intensity of such sector or subsector, but only for determining such trade intensity."}

(a)ReportNot later than January 1, 2017, and every 2 years thereafter, the President shall submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of the distribution of emission allowance rebates under subpart 1 in mitigating carbon leakage in eligible industrial sectors. Such report shall also include— 
(1)an assessment, for each eligible industrial sector receiving emission allowance rebates, as to whether, and by how much, the per unit cost of production has increased for that sector as a result of compliance with section 722 (as determined in a manner consistent with section 764(b)), taking into account the provision of the emission allowance rebates to that industrial sector and the benefit received by that industrial sector from the provision of free allowances to electricity providers pursuant to section 782(a);  
(2)recommendations on how to better achieve the purposes of this subpart, including an assessment of the feasibility and usefulness of an international reserve allowance program for the eligible industrial sector under section 768; 
(3)to the extent the President determines that an international reserve allowance program would not be useful for the eligible industrial sector because its exposure to carbon leakage is the result of competition in export markets with goods produced in countries not implementing similar greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, an identification of, and to the extent appropriate a description of how the President will implement, alternative actions or programs consistent with the purposes of this subpart (and, in such case, the President may determine not to apply an international reserve allowance program to the eligible industrial sector under subsection (b)); and  
(4)an assessment of the amount and duration of assistance, including distribution of free allowances, being provided to industrial sectors in other developed countries to mitigate costs of compliance with domestic greenhouse gas reduction programs in such countries. 
(b)Presidential determination 
(1)In generalIf, by January 1, 2018, a multilateral agreement consistent with the negotiating objectives set forth in section 766 has not entered into force with respect to the United States, the President shall establish an international reserve allowance program for each eligible industrial sector to the extent provided under section 768 unless— 
(A)the President determines and certifies to the Congress with respect to such eligible industrial sector that such program would not be in the national economic interest or environmental interest of the United States; and 
(B)not later than 90 days after the President transmits the certification described in subparagraph (A), a joint resolution is enacted into law that approves the determination of the President described in subparagraph (A). 
(2)Contents of joint resolutionFor purposes of this subsection, the term joint resolution means only a joint resolution of the two Houses of Congress, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: That the Congress approves the determination of the President under section 768(b)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act transmitted to the Congress on ______., the blank space being filled with the appropriate date.

(4)Rule of constructionFor purposes of this section and section 768, if the President transmits a multilateral agreement to Congress (regardless of whether it is transmitted as a treaty for ratification by the Senate or another international agreement for implementation by law enacted by the Congress) indicating that the agreement is consistent with the negotiating objectives set forth in section 766, such agreement will be considered to be consistent with such negotiating objectives as of the date on which the Senate ratifies the treaty, or legislation is enacted implementing such other agreement, unless the Senate (in the case of ratification) or the implementing legislation expressly provides that the multilateral agreement shall not be treated as consistent with such negotiating objectives for purposes of this section and section 768.  
(c)Determinations with respect to eligible industrial sectorsIf the President establishes an international reserve allowance program pursuant to subsection (b), then not later than June 30, 2018, and every 4 years thereafter, the President, in consultation with the Administrator and other appropriate agencies, shall determine, for each eligible industrial sector, whether or not more than 85 percent of United States imports of covered goods with respect to that sector are produced or manufactured in countries that have met at least one of the following criteria: 
(1)The country is a party to an international agreement to which the United States is a party that includes a nationally enforceable and economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitment for that country that is at least as stringent as that of the United States. 
(2)The country is a party to a multilateral or bilateral emission reduction agreement for that sector to the which the United States is a party. 
(3)The country has an annual energy or greenhouse gas intensity, as described in section 763(b)(2)(A)(ii), for the sector that is equal to or less than the energy or greenhouse gas intensity for such industrial sector in the United States in the most recent calendar year for which data are available. 
(d)Effect of Presidential determination 
(1)Required actionsIf the President makes a determination under subsection (c) with respect to an eligible industrial sector that 85 percent or less of United States imports of covered goods with respect to the sector are produced or manufactured in countries that have met one or more of the criteria in subsection (c), then the President shall, not later than June 30, 2018, and every 4 years thereafter— 
(A)assess the extent to which the emission allowance rebates provided pursuant to subpart 1 and the benefit received by that industrial sector from the provision of free allowances to electricity providers pursuant to section 782(a) have mitigated or addressed, or could mitigate or address, carbon leakage in that sector; 
(B)assess the extent to which an international reserve allowance program has mitigated or addressed, or could mitigate or address, carbon leakage in that sector; and 
(C)with respect to that sector— 
(i)modify the percentage by which direct and indirect carbon factors will be multiplied under section 764(a)(1)(B); and 
(ii)apply or continue to apply an international reserve allowance program under section 768 with respect to imports of covered goods with respect to that sector. 
(2)Prohibited actionsIf the President makes a determination under subsection (c) with respect to an eligible industrial sector that more than 85 percent of United States imports of covered goods with respect to the sector are produced or manufactured in countries that have met one or more of the criteria in subsection (c), then the President may not apply or continue to apply an international reserve allowance program under section 768 with respect to imports of covered goods with respect to that sector.  
(e)Report to CongressNot later than June 30, 2018, and every 4 years thereafter, the President shall transmit to the Congress a report providing notice of any determination made under subsection (c), explaining the reasons for such determination, and identifying the actions taken by the President under subsection (d).

(B)ensuring that the price for purchasing the international reserve allowances from the United States on a particular day is equivalent to the auction clearing price for emission allowances under section 722 for the most recent emission allowance auction; 
(C)establishing a general methodology for calculating the quantity of international reserve allowances that a United States importer of any covered good must submit;  
(D)requiring the submission of appropriate amounts of such allowances for covered goods with respect to the eligible industrial sector that enter the customs territory of the United States; 
(E)exempting from the requirements of subparagraph (D) such products that are the origin of— 
(i)any country determined to meet any of the standards provided in section 767(c); 
(ii)any foreign country that the United Nations has identified as among the least developed of developing countries; or 
(iii)any foreign country that the President has determined to be responsible for less than 0.5 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions and less than 5 percent of United States imports of covered goods with respect to the eligible industrial sector;  
(F)specifying the procedures that U.S. Customs and Border Protection will apply for the declaration and entry of covered goods with respect to the eligible industrial sector into the customs territory of the United States; and 
(G)establishing procedures that prevent circumvention of the international reserve allowance requirement for covered goods with respect to the eligible industrial sector that are manufactured or processed in more than one foreign country.  
(2)Purpose of programThe Administrator shall establish the program under paragraph (1) consistent with international agreements to which the United States is a party, in a manner that minimizes the likelihood of carbon leakage as a result of differences between— 
(A)the direct and indirect costs of complying with section 722; and 
(B)the direct and indirect costs, if any, of complying in other countries with greenhouse gas regulatory programs, requirements, export tariffs, or other measures adopted or imposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
(b)Emission allowance rebatesIn establishing a general methodology for purposes of subsection (a)(1)(C), the Administrator shall include an adjustment to the quantity of international reserve allowances based on the value of emission allowance rebates distributed under subpart 1 and the benefit received by the eligible industrial sector concerned from the provision of free allowances to electricity providers pursuant to section 782(a) and may, if appropriate, determine that the quantity of international reserve allowances should be reduced as low as to zero. 
(c)Effective dateThe international reserve allowance program may not apply to imports of covered goods entering the customs territory of the United States before January 1, 2020. 
(d)Covered entitiesInternational reserve allowances may not be used by covered entities to comply with section 722."}

(A)Eligibility criteria 
(i)In generalAn owner or operator of an entity shall be eligible to receive emission allowance rebates under this subpart if such entity is in an industrial sector that is included in a six-digit classification of the NAICS that meets the criteria in both clauses (ii) and (iii), or the criteria in clause (iv).   
(ii)Energy or greenhouse gas intensityAs determined by the Administrator, the industrial sector had— 
(I)an energy intensity of at least 5 percent, calculated by dividing the cost of purchased electricity and fuel costs of the sector by the value of the shipments of the sector, based on data described in subparagraph (D); or 
(II)a greenhouse gas intensity of at least 5 percent, calculated by dividing— 
(aa)the number 20 multiplied by the number of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions (including direct emissions from fuel combustion, process emissions, and indirect emissions from the generation of electricity used to produce the output of the sector) of the sector based on data described in subparagraph (D); by 
(bb)the value of the shipments of the sector, based on data described in subparagraph (D).  
(iii)Trade intensityAs determined by the Administrator, the industrial sector had a trade intensity of at least 15 percent, calculated by dividing the value of the total imports and exports of such sector by the value of the shipments plus the value of imports of such sector, based on data described in subparagraph (D). 
(iv)Very high energy or greenhouse gas intensityAs determined by the Administrator, the industrial sector had an energy or greenhouse gas intensity, as calculated under clause (ii)(I) or (II), of at least 20 percent. 
(B)Metal and phosphate production classified under more than one naics codeFor purposes of this section, the Administrator shall— 
(i)aggregate data for the beneficiation or other processing (including agglomeration) of metal ores, including iron and copper ores, soda ash, or phosphate with subsequent steps in the process of metal and phosphate manufacturing, regardless of the NAICS code under which such activity is classified; and 
(ii)aggregate data for the manufacturing of steel with the manufacturing of steel pipe and tube made from purchased steel in a nonintegrated process. 
(C)ExclusionThe petroleum refining sector shall not be an eligible industrial sector. 
(D)Data sources 
(i)Electricity and fuel costs, value of shipmentsThe Administrator shall determine electricity and fuel costs and the value of shipments under this subsection from data from the United States Census Annual Survey of Manufacturers. The Administrator shall take the average of data from as many of the years of 2004, 2005, and 2006 for which such data are available. If such data are unavailable, the Administrator shall make a determination based upon 2002 or 2006 data from the most detailed industrial classification level of Energy Information Agency’s Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (using 2006 data if it is available) and the 2002 or 2007 Economic Census of the United States (using 2007 data if it is available). If data from the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey or Economic Census are unavailable for any sector at the six-digit classification level in the NAICS, then the Administrator may extrapolate the information necessary to determine the eligibility of a sector under this paragraph from available Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey or Economic Census data pertaining to a broader industrial category classified in the NAICS. If data relating to the beneficiation or other processing (including agglomeration) of metal ores, including iron and copper ores, soda ash, or phosphate are not available from the specified data sources, the Administrator shall use the best available Federal or State government data and may use, to the extent necessary, representative data submitted by entities that perform such beneficiation or other processing (including agglomeration), in making a determination. Fuel cost data shall not include the cost of fuel used as feedstock by an industrial sector.  
(ii)Imports and exportsThe Administrator shall base the value of imports and exports under this subsection on United States International Trade Commission data. The Administrator shall take the average of data from as many of the years of 2004, 2005, and 2006 for which such data are available. If data from the United States International Trade Commission are unavailable for any sector at the six-digit classification level in the NAICS, then the Administrator may extrapolate the information necessary to determine the eligibility of a sector under this paragraph from available United States International Trade Commission data pertaining to a broader industrial category classified in the NAICS. 
(iii)PercentagesThe Administrator shall round the energy intensity, greenhouse gas intensity, and trade intensity percentages under subparagraph (A) to the nearest whole number. 
(iv)Greenhouse gas emission calculationsWhen calculating the tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions for each sector under subparagraph (A)(ii)(II)(aa), the Administrator— 
(I)shall use the best available data from as many of the years 2004, 2005, and 2006 for which such data is available; and 
(II)may, to the extent necessary with respect to a sector, use economic and engineering models and the best available information on technology performance levels for such sector."}

(B)Individual showing petition 
(i)PetitionIn addition to designation under paragraph (2) or subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the owner or operator of an entity in an industrial sector may petition the Administrator to designate as eligible industrial sectors under this subpart an entity or a group of entities that— 
(I)represent a subsector of a six-digit section of the NAICS code; and 
(II)meet the eligibility criteria in both clauses (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (2)(A), or the eligibility criteria in clause (iv) of paragraph (2)(A). 
(ii)DataIn making a determination under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall consider data submitted by the petitioner that is specific to the entity, data solicited by the Administrator from other entities in the subsector, if such other entities exist, and data specified in paragraph (2)(D). 
(iii)Basis of subsector determinationThe Administrator shall determine an entity or group of entities to be a subsector of a six-digit section of the NAICS code based only upon the products manufactured and not the industrial process by which the products are manufactured, except that the Administrator may determine an entity or group of entities that manufacture a product from primarily virgin material to be a separate subsector from another entity or group of entities that manufacture the same product primarily from recycled material. 
(iv)Use of most recent dataIn determining whether to designate a sector or subsector as an eligible industrial sector under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall use the most recent data available from the sources described in paragraph (2)(D), rather than the data from the years specified in paragraph (2)(D), to determine the trade intensity of such sector or subsector, but only for determining such trade intensity. 
(v)Final actionThe Administrator shall take final action on such petition no later than 6 months after the petition is received by the Administrator."}

 Inserted paragraph content is: {"764.Distribution of emission allowance rebates 
(a)Distribution schedule 
(1)In generalFor each vintage year, the Administrator shall distribute pursuant to this section emission allowances made available under section 782(e), no later than October 31 of the preceding calendar year. The Administrator shall make such annual distributions to the owners and operators of each entity in an eligible industrial sector in the amount of emission allowances calculated under subsection (b), except that— 
(A)for vintage years 2012 and 2013, the distribution for a covered entity shall be pursuant to the entity’s indirect carbon factor as calculated under subsection (b)(3); 
(B)for vintage year 2026 and thereafter, the distribution shall be pursuant to the amount calculated under subsection (b) multiplied by, except as modified by the President pursuant to section 767(d)(1)(C) for a sector— 
(i)90 percent for vintage year 2026; 
(ii)80 percent for vintage year 2027; 
(iii)70 percent for vintage year 2028; 
(iv)60 percent for vintage year 2029; 
(v)50 percent for vintage year 2030; 
(vi)40 percent for vintage year 2031; 
(vii)30 percent for vintage year 2032; 
(viii)20 percent for vintage year 2033; 
(ix)10 percent for vintage year 2034; and 
(x)0 percent for vintage year 2035 and thereafter. 
(2)Resumption of reductionIf the President has modified the percentage stated in paragraph (1)(B) under section 767(d)(1)(C), and the President subsequently makes a determination under section 767(c) for an eligible industrial sector that more than 85 percent of United States imports for that sector are produced or manufactured in countries that have met at least one of the criteria in that section, then the 10-year reduction schedule set forth in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall begin in the next vintage year, with the percentage reduction based on the amount of the distribution of emission allowances under this section in the previous year.  
(3)Newly eligible sectorsIn addition to receiving a distribution of emission allowances under this section in the first distribution occurring after an industrial sector is designated as eligible under section 763(b)(3), the owner or operator of an entity in that eligible industrial sector may receive a prorated share of any emission allowances made available for distribution under this section that were not distributed for the year in which the petition for eligibility was granted under section 763(b)(3)(A). 
(4)Cessation of qualifying activitiesIf, as determined by the Administrator, a facility is no longer in an eligible industrial sector designated under section 763— 
(A)the Administrator shall not distribute emission allowances to the owner or operator of such facility under this section; and 
(B)the owner or operator of such facility shall return to the Administrator all allowances that have been distributed to it for future vintage years and a pro-rated amount of allowances distributed to the facility under this section for the vintage year in which the facility ceases to be in an eligible industrial sector designated under section 763. 
(b)Calculation of direct and indirect carbon factors 
(1)In general 
(A)Covered entitiesExcept as provided in subsection (a), for covered entities that are in eligible industrial sectors, the amount of emission allowance rebates shall be based on the sum of the covered entity’s direct and indirect carbon factors. 
(B)Other eligible entitiesFor entities that are in eligible industrial sectors but are not covered entities, the amount of emission allowance rebates shall be based on the entity’s indirect carbon factor. 
(C)New entitiesNot later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this title, the Administrator shall issue regulations governing the distribution of emission allowance rebates for the first and second years of operation of a new entity in an eligible industrial sector. These regulations shall provide for— 
(i)the distribution of emission allowance rebates to such entities based on comparable entities in the same sector; and 
(ii)an adjustment in the third and fourth years of operation to reconcile the total amount of emission allowance rebates received during the first and second years of operation to the amount the entity would have received during the first and second years of operation had the appropriate data been available. 
(2)Direct carbon factorThe direct carbon factor for a covered entity for a vintage year is the product of— 
(A)the average annual output of the covered entity for the 2 years preceding the year of the distribution; and 
(B)the most recent calculation of the average direct greenhouse gas emissions (expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) per unit of output for all covered entities in the sector, as determined by the Administrator under paragraph (4). 
(3)Indirect carbon factor 
(A)In generalThe indirect carbon factor for an entity for a vintage year is the product obtained by multiplying the average annual output of the entity for the 2 years preceding the year of the distribution by both the electricity emissions intensity factor determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) and the electricity efficiency factor determined pursuant to subparagraph (C) for the year concerned. 
(B)Electricity emissions intensity factor 
(i)In generalEach person selling electricity to the owner or operator of an entity in any sector designated as an eligible industrial sector under section 763(b) shall provide the owner or operator of the entity and the Administrator, on an annual basis, the electricity emissions intensity factor for the entity. The electricity emissions intensity factor for the entity, expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per kilowatt hour, is determined by dividing— 
(I)the annual sum of the hourly product of— 
(aa)the electricity purchased by the entity from that person in each hour (expressed in kilowatt hours); multiplied by 
(bb)the marginal or weighted average tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour that are reflected in the electricity charges to the entity, as determined by the entity’s retail rate arrangements; by 
(II)the total kilowatt hours of electricity purchased by the entity from that person during that year. 
(ii)Use of other data to determine factorWhere it is not possible to determine the precise electricity emissions intensity factor for an entity using the methodology in clause (i), the person selling electricity shall use the monthly average data reported by the Energy Information Administration or collected and reported by the Administrator for the utility serving the entity to determine the electricity emissions intensity factor. 
(C)Electricity efficiency factorThe electricity efficiency factor is the average amount of electricity (in kilowatt hours) used per unit of output for all entities in the relevant sector, as determined by the Administrator based on the best available data, including data provided under paragraph (6). 
(D)Indirect carbon factor reductionIf an electricity provider received a free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to section 782(a), the Administrator shall adjust the indirect carbon factor to avoid rebates to the eligible entity for costs that the Administrator determines were not incurred by the eligible entity because the allowances were freely allocated to the eligible entity’s electricity provider and used for the benefit of industrial consumers. 
(4)Greenhouse gas intensity calculationsThe Administrator shall calculate the average direct greenhouse gas emissions (expressed in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) per unit of output and the electricity efficiency factor for all covered entities in each eligible industrial sector every 4 years, using an average of the four most recent years of the best available data. For purposes of the lists required to be published no later than February 1, 2013, the Administrator shall use the best available data for the maximum number of years, up to 4 years, for which data are available.  
(5)Ensuring efficiency improvementsWhen making greenhouse gas calculations, the Administrator shall— 
(A)limit the average direct greenhouse gas emissions per unit of output, calculated under paragraph (4), for any eligible industrial sector to an amount that is not greater than it was in any previous calculation under this subsection; 
(B)limit the electricity emissions intensity factor, calculated under paragraph (3)(B) and resulting from a change in electricity supply, for any entity to an amount that is not greater than it was during any previous year; and 
(C)limit the electricity efficiency factor, calculated under paragraph (3)(C), for any eligible industrial sector to an amount that is not greater than it was in any previous calculation under this subsection. 
(6)Data sourcesFor the purposes of this subsection— 
(A)the Administrator shall use data from the greenhouse gas registry established under section 713, where it is available; and 
(B)each owner or operator of an entity in an eligible industrial sector and each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States shall provide the Administrator with such information as the Administrator finds necessary to determine the direct carbon factor and the indirect carbon factor for each entity subject to this section. 
(c)Total maximum distributionNotwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), the Administrator shall not distribute more allowances for any vintage year pursuant to this section than are allocated for use under this subpart pursuant to section 782(e) for that vintage year. For any vintage year for which the total emission allowance rebates calculated pursuant to this section exceed the number of allowances allocated pursuant to section 782(e), the Administrator shall reduce each entity’s distribution on a pro rata basis so that the total distribution under this section equals the number of allowances allocated under section 782(e). 
(d)Iron and steel sectorFor purposes of this section, the Administrator shall consider as in different industrial sectors— 
(1)entities using integrated iron and steelmaking technologies (including coke ovens, blast furnaces, and other iron-making technologies); and 
(2)entities using electric arc furnace technologies. 
(e)Metal, soda ash, or phosphate production classified under more than one naics codeFor purposes of this section, the Administrator shall not aggregate data for the beneficiation or other processing (including agglomeration) of metal ores, soda ash, or phosphate with subsequent steps in the process of metal, soda ash, or phosphate manufacturing. The Administrator shall consider the beneficiation or other processing (including agglomeration) of metal ores, soda ash, or phosphate to be in separate industrial sectors from the metal, soda ash, or phosphate manufacturing sectors. Industrial sectors that beneficiate or otherwise process (including agglomeration) metal ores, soda ash, or phosphate shall not receive emission allowance rebates under this section related to the activity of extracting metal ores, soda ash, or phosphate. 
(f)Combined heat and powerFor purposes of this section, and to achieve the purpose set forth in section 761(b)(2), the Administrator may consider entities to be in different industrial sectors or otherwise take into account the differences among entities in the same industrial sector, based upon the extent to which such entities use combined heat and power technologies.

(a)ReportNot later than January 1, 2017, and every 2 years thereafter, the President shall submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of the distribution of emission allowance rebates under subpart 1 in mitigating carbon leakage in eligible industrial sectors. Such report shall also include— 
(1)an assessment, for each eligible industrial sector receiving emission allowance rebates, as to whether, and by how much, the per unit cost of production has increased for that sector as a result of compliance with section 722 (as determined in a manner consistent with section 764(b)), taking into account the provision of the emission allowance rebates to that industrial sector and the benefit received by that industrial sector from the provision of free allowances to electricity providers pursuant to section 782(a);  
(2)recommendations on how to better achieve the purposes of this subpart, including an assessment of the feasibility and usefulness of an international reserve allowance program for the eligible industrial sector under section 768; 
(3)to the extent the President determines that an international reserve allowance program would not be useful for the eligible industrial sector because its exposure to carbon leakage is the result of competition in export markets with goods produced in countries not implementing similar greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, an identification of, and to the extent appropriate a description of how the President will implement, alternative actions or programs consistent with the purposes of this subpart (and, in such case, the President may determine not to apply an international reserve allowance program to the eligible industrial sector under subsection (b)); and  
(4)an assessment of the amount and duration of assistance, including distribution of free allowances, being provided to industrial sectors in other developed countries to mitigate costs of compliance with domestic greenhouse gas reduction programs in such countries. 
(b)Presidential determination 
(1)In generalIf, by January 1, 2018, a multilateral agreement consistent with the negotiating objectives set forth in section 766 has not entered into force with respect to the United States, the President shall establish an international reserve allowance program for each eligible industrial sector to the extent provided under section 768 unless— 
(A)the President determines and certifies to the Congress with respect to such eligible industrial sector that such program would not be in the national economic interest or environmental interest of the United States; and 
(B)not later than 90 days after the President transmits the certification described in subparagraph (A), a joint resolution is enacted into law that approves the determination of the President described in subparagraph (A). 
(2)Contents of joint resolutionFor purposes of this subsection, the term joint resolution means only a joint resolution of the two Houses of Congress, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: That the Congress approves the determination of the President under section 768(b)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act transmitted to the Congress on ______., the blank space being filled with the appropriate date.

(4)Rule of constructionFor purposes of this section and section 768, if the President transmits a multilateral agreement to Congress (regardless of whether it is transmitted as a treaty for ratification by the Senate or another international agreement for implementation by law enacted by the Congress) indicating that the agreement is consistent with the negotiating objectives set forth in section 766, such agreement will be considered to be consistent with such negotiating objectives as of the date on which the Senate ratifies the treaty, or legislation is enacted implementing such other agreement, unless the Senate (in the case of ratification) or the implementing legislation expressly provides that the multilateral agreement shall not be treated as consistent with such negotiating objectives for purposes of this section and section 768.  
(c)Determinations with respect to eligible industrial sectorsIf the President establishes an international reserve allowance program pursuant to subsection (b), then not later than June 30, 2018, and every 4 years thereafter, the President, in consultation with the Administrator and other appropriate agencies, shall determine, for each eligible industrial sector, whether or not more than 85 percent of United States imports of covered goods with respect to that sector are produced or manufactured in countries that have met at least one of the following criteria: 
(1)The country is a party to an international agreement to which the United States is a party that includes a nationally enforceable and economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitment for that country that is at least as stringent as that of the United States. 
(2)The country is a party to a multilateral or bilateral emission reduction agreement for that sector to the which the United States is a party. 
(3)The country has an annual energy or greenhouse gas intensity, as described in section 763(b)(2)(A)(ii), for the sector that is equal to or less than the energy or greenhouse gas intensity for such industrial sector in the United States in the most recent calendar year for which data are available. 
(d)Effect of Presidential determination 
(1)Required actionsIf the President makes a determination under subsection (c) with respect to an eligible industrial sector that 85 percent or less of United States imports of covered goods with respect to the sector are produced or manufactured in countries that have met one or more of the criteria in subsection (c), then the President shall, not later than June 30, 2018, and every 4 years thereafter— 
(A)assess the extent to which the emission allowance rebates provided pursuant to subpart 1 and the benefit received by that industrial sector from the provision of free allowances to electricity providers pursuant to section 782(a) have mitigated or addressed, or could mitigate or address, carbon leakage in that sector; 
(B)assess the extent to which an international reserve allowance program has mitigated or addressed, or could mitigate or address, carbon leakage in that sector; and 
(C)with respect to that sector— 
(i)modify the percentage by which direct and indirect carbon factors will be multiplied under section 764(a)(1)(B); and 
(ii)apply or continue to apply an international reserve allowance program under section 768 with respect to imports of covered goods with respect to that sector. 
(2)Prohibited actionsIf the President makes a determination under subsection (c) with respect to an eligible industrial sector that more than 85 percent of United States imports of covered goods with respect to the sector are produced or manufactured in countries that have met one or more of the criteria in subsection (c), then the President may not apply or continue to apply an international reserve allowance program under section 768 with respect to imports of covered goods with respect to that sector.  
(e)Report to CongressNot later than June 30, 2018, and every 4 years thereafter, the President shall transmit to the Congress a report providing notice of any determination made under subsection (c), explaining the reasons for such determination, and identifying the actions taken by the President under subsection (d).

(a)Establishment 
(1)In generalThe Administrator, with the concurrence of Commissioner responsible for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall issue regulations— 
(A)establishing an international reserve allowance program for the sale, exchange, purchase, transfer, and banking of international reserve allowances for covered goods with respect to the eligible industrial sector; 
(B)ensuring that the price for purchasing the international reserve allowances from the United States on a particular day is equivalent to the auction clearing price for emission allowances under section 722 for the most recent emission allowance auction; 
(C)establishing a general methodology for calculating the quantity of international reserve allowances that a United States importer of any covered good must submit;  
(D)requiring the submission of appropriate amounts of such allowances for covered goods with respect to the eligible industrial sector that enter the customs territory of the United States; 
(E)exempting from the requirements of subparagraph (D) such products that are the origin of— 
(i)any country determined to meet any of the standards provided in section 767(c); 
(ii)any foreign country that the United Nations has identified as among the least developed of developing countries; or 
(iii)any foreign country that the President has determined to be responsible for less than 0.5 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions and less than 5 percent of United States imports of covered goods with respect to the eligible industrial sector;  
(F)specifying the procedures that U.S. Customs and Border Protection will apply for the declaration and entry of covered goods with respect to the eligible industrial sector into the customs territory of the United States; and 
(G)establishing procedures that prevent circumvention of the international reserve allowance requirement for covered goods with respect to the eligible industrial sector that are manufactured or processed in more than one foreign country.  
(2)Purpose of programThe Administrator shall establish the program under paragraph (1) consistent with international agreements to which the United States is a party, in a manner that minimizes the likelihood of carbon leakage as a result of differences between— 
(A)the direct and indirect costs of complying with section 722; and 
(B)the direct and indirect costs, if any, of complying in other countries with greenhouse gas regulatory programs, requirements, export tariffs, or other measures adopted or imposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
(b)Emission allowance rebatesIn establishing a general methodology for purposes of subsection (a)(1)(C), the Administrator shall include an adjustment to the quantity of international reserve allowances based on the value of emission allowance rebates distributed under subpart 1 and the benefit received by the eligible industrial sector concerned from the provision of free allowances to electricity providers pursuant to section 782(a) and may, if appropriate, determine that the quantity of international reserve allowances should be reduced as low as to zero. 
(c)Effective dateThe international reserve allowance program may not apply to imports of covered goods entering the customs territory of the United States before January 1, 2020. 
(d)Covered entitiesInternational reserve allowances may not be used by covered entities to comply with section 722."}

(C)Notwithstanding subsection (i)(4), the Secretary may promulgate regulations allowing for streamlined eligibility determinations for some or all households which include individuals receiving assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX or XXI of this Act. The regulations may institute procedures whereby the income and family size information used for determining eligibility under such title XIX or XXI may be the basis for determining eligibility for the Energy Refund Program. 
(D)Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may authorize States to provide benefits under this section on a quarterly basis if the Secretary determines that the amount of the benefits that would be provided on a monthly basis to households is insufficient to be efficiently paid on a monthly basis in light of the administrative expenses of the Energy Refund Program.

(A)In general 
(i)The maximum energy tax credit shall vary based on the number of individuals in the tax filing unit.

(C)In the case of an eligible individual who does not file a joint return and has at least one individual qualifying individual— 
(i)If the eligible individual has one qualifying individual, the lowest income level that exceeds the phaseout amount as defined in section 32(b)(2) at which a single individual with one qualifying child is ineligible for the earned income credit for the taxable year.

(G)reduction in greenhouse gas emissions due to changes in animal management practices, including dietary modifications; 
(2)changes in carbon stocks attributed to land use change and forestry activities, including— 
(A)afforestation or reforestation of acreage that is not forested; 
(B)forest management resulting in an increase in forest carbon stores including but not limited to harvested wood products; 
(C)management of peatland or wetland;  
(D)conservation of grassland and forested land;

(2)Consideration of petitionsThe Secretary shall— 
(A)consider petitions to add types of offset practices to the list established under subsection (a); and 
(B)add those types of offset practices to the list if the types of offset practices meet standards for environmental integrity consistent with the purposes of this title. 
(3)Time for consideration of petitionsNot later than 1 year after the receipt of a petition under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall make a decision to either grant or deny the petition and publish a written explanation of the reasons for the Secretary’s decision. The Secretary may not deny a petition under this subsection on the basis of inadequate Department of Agriculture resources at the time of the review. 
504.Requirements for domestic agricultural and forestry practices 
(a)Methodologies 
(1)In general; conditionIn promulgating regulations under section 502, the Secretary shall establish methodologies for domestic agricultural and forestry practices listed under section 503, if the Secretary determines that methodologies can be established for such practices that meet each of the requirements of this section. The Secretary shall only issue offset credits under this title pursuant to promulgated methodologies applicable to the offset practice that avoided or reduced greenhouse gas emissions or sequestered greenhouse gases. 
(2)Specified methodologiesThe Secretary shall establish the following methodologies under this section: 
(A)Activity baselinesA standardized methodology for establishing activity baselines for an offset practice of that type. The Secretary shall set activity baselines to reflect a conservative estimate of performance or activities for the relevant type of practice (excluding changes in performance or activities due to the availability of offset credits) such that the baseline provides an adequate margin of safety to ensure the environmental integrity of offset credits calculated in reference to such baseline. 
(B)AdditionalityA standardized methodology for determining the additionality of greenhouse gas emissions reduction or avoidance, or greenhouse gas sequestration, achieved by an offset practice of that type. Such methodology shall ensure, at a minimum, that any greenhouse gas emission reduction or avoidance, or any greenhouse gas sequestration, is considered additional only to the extent that it results from activities that— 
(i)are not required by existing government regulations, as determined by the Secretary;  
(ii)were not commenced prior to January 1, 2009, except in the case of— 
(I)offset project activities that commenced after January 1, 2001, and were registered as of the date of enactment of this title under an offset program with respect to which an affirmative determination has been made under section 740 of the Clean Air Act; or  
(II)activities that are readily reversible, with respect to which the Secretary may set an alternative earlier date under this subparagraph that is not earlier than January 1, 2001, where the Secretary determines that setting such an alternative date may produce an environmental benefit by removing an incentive to cease and then reinitiate activities that began prior to January 1, 2009; and 
(iii)exceed the applicable activity baseline established under paragraph (2). 
(C)Quantification methodsA standardized methodology for determining the extent to which greenhouse gas emission reductions or avoidance, or greenhouse gas sequestration, achieved by an offset practice of that type exceeded a relevant activity baseline, including methods for monitoring and accounting for uncertainty. 
(D)LeakageA standardized methodology for accounting for and mitigating potential leakage, if any, from an offset practice of that type, taking uncertainty into account, excluding international indirect land use changes unless a positive determination is made under section 211(o)(13)(C)(iii) of the Clean Air Act. 
(b)Special considerations 
(1)Existing offset practicesIn establishing the methodologies under subsection (a), the Secretary shall give due consideration to methodologies for offset practices existing as of the date of the enactment of this title. 
(2)Certain factorsAs part of the methodologies established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall establish a formula that takes into account the components of the practice, the characteristics of the land on which the practice is applied, the crop produced, and such other factors as determined appropriate by the Secretary. 
(c)Accounting for reversals 
(1)In generalExcept as provided in subsection (d) with respect to issuance of a term offset credit, for each type of practice listed under section 503, the Secretary shall establish requirements to account for and address reversals, including— 
(A)a requirement to report any reversal with respect to an offset practice for which offset credits have been issued under this title; 
(B)provisions to require emission allowances or offset credits to be held in amounts to fully compensate for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to reversals, and to assign responsibility for holding such emission allowances; and 
(C)any other provisions that the Secretary determines to be necessary to account for and address reversals. 
(2)Mechanisms 
(A)In generalThe Secretary shall prescribe mechanisms to ensure that any sequestration of greenhouse gases, with respect to which an offset credit is issued under this title, results in a permanent net increase in sequestration of greenhouse gases, and that full account is taken of any actual or potential reversal of such sequestration, with an adequate margin of safety. 
(B)Specific mechanismsThe Secretary shall make available one or more of the following mechanisms to meet the requirements of this paragraph: 
(i)An offsets reserve, pursuant to paragraph (3). 
(ii)Insurance that provides for purchase and provision to the Secretary for retirement of a quantity of offset credits or emission allowances equal in number to the tons of carbon dioxide equivalents of greenhouse gas emissions released due to reversal.
