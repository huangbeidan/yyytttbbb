(ii)FactorsIn making any decision to grant an extension under clause (i) to a holding company of an industrial bank, the appropriate Federal supervisory agent of such holding company shall consider whether— 
(I)the company has made a good faith effort to divest such interests; and 
(II)such extension is necessary to avert substantial loss to the company.

(ii)order the holding company of the industrial bank, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, and after consultation with the appropriate State bank supervisor for the industrial bank, to terminate (within 120 days or such longer period as the appropriate Federal supervisory agency may direct) the ownership or control of any such industrial bank by such company.

(4)Foreign bank ownershipAfter January 28, 2007, no foreign bank may acquire, directly or indirectly, control of an industrial bank unless the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has determined, by order, in connection with the change in control or acquisition of the industrial bank and after consultation with the Corporation, that the foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in the bank’s home country in accordance with the standard in section 3(c)(3)(B) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. 
(5)Holding company responsibility 
(A)Source of strengthNotwithstanding section 45, a holding company of an industrial bank— 
(i)shall serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the subsidiary banks of such holding company; and
