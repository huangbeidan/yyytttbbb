(A)General ruleIn the cases described in paragraph (1), notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2)(C), the succeeding subparagraphs of this paragraph shall apply with respect to an action under this subsection by the Secretary with respect to any failure of a health insurance issuer in connection with a group health plan, to meet the requirements of subsection (a)(1)(F), (b)(3), (c), or (d) of section 2702 or section 2701 or 2702(b)(1) with respect to genetic information in connection with the plan. 
(B)Amount 
(i)In generalThe amount of the penalty imposed under this paragraph shall be $100 for each day in the noncompliance period with respect to each participant or beneficiary to whom such failure relates. 
(ii)Noncompliance periodFor purposes of this paragraph, the term noncompliance period means, with respect to any failure, the period— 
(I)beginning on the date such failure first occurs; and 
(II)ending on the date the failure is corrected. 
(C)Minimum penalties where failure discoveredNotwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (D): 
(i)In generalIn the case of 1 or more failures with respect to an individual— 
(I)which are not corrected before the date on which the plan receives a notice from the Secretary of such violation; and 
(II)which occurred or continued during the period involved;the amount of penalty imposed by subparagraph (A) by reason of such failures with respect to such individual shall not be less than $2,500. 
(ii)Higher minimum penalty where violations are more than de minimisTo the extent violations for which any person is liable under this paragraph for any year are more than de minimis, clause (i) shall be applied by substituting $15,000 for $2,500 with respect to such person. 
(D)Limitations 
(i)Penalty not to apply where failure not discovered exercising reasonable diligenceNo penalty shall be imposed by subparagraph (A) on any failure during any period for which it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the person otherwise liable for such penalty did not know, and exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, that such failure existed. 
(ii)Penalty not to apply to failures corrected within certain periodsNo penalty shall be imposed by subparagraph (A) on any failure if— 
(I)such failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect; and 
(II)such failure is corrected during the 30-day period beginning on the first date the person otherwise liable for such penalty knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that such failure existed. 
(iii)Overall limitation for unintentional failuresIn the case of failures which are due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the penalty imposed by subparagraph (A) for failures shall not exceed the amount equal to the lesser of— 
(I)10 percent of the aggregate amount paid or incurred by the employer (or predecessor employer) during the preceding taxable year for group health plans; or 
(II)$500,000. 
(E)Waiver by secretaryIn the case of a failure which is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the Secretary may waive part or all of the penalty imposed by subparagraph (A) to the extent that the payment of such penalty would be excessive relative to the failure involved.."}

(3)Rule of construction regarding payment 
(A)In generalNothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed to preclude a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in the individual market from obtaining and using the results of a genetic test in making a determination regarding payment (as such term is defined for the purposes of applying the regulations promulgated by the Secretary under part C of title XI of the Social Security Act and section 264 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as may be revised from time to time) consistent with subsection (a) and (c). 
(B)LimitationFor purposes of subparagraph (A), a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in the individual market may request only the minimum amount of information necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. 
(4)Research exceptionNotwithstanding paragraph (1), a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in the individual market may request, but not require, that an individual or a family member of such individual undergo a genetic test if each of the following conditions is met: 
(A)The request is made pursuant to research that complies with part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, or equivalent Federal regulations, and any applicable State or local law or regulations for the protection of human subjects in research.

(i)compliance with the request is voluntary; and 
(ii)non-compliance will have no effect on enrollment status or premium or contribution amounts. 
(C)No genetic information collected or acquired under this paragraph shall be used for underwriting purposes. Q: Aren’t these activities already generally prohibited under HIPAA after the application of the other amendments made by this Act? 
(D)The issuer notifies the Secretary in writing that the issuer is conducting activities pursuant to the exception provided for under this paragraph, including a description of the activities conducted. 
(E)The issuer complies with such other conditions as the Secretary may by regulation require for activities conducted under this paragraph."}

(ii)Higher minimum penalty where violations are more than de minimisTo the extent violations for which any person is liable under this paragraph for any year are more than de minimis, clause (i) shall be applied by substituting $15,000 for $2,500 with respect to such person. 
(D)Limitations 
(i)Penalty not to apply where failure not discovered exercising reasonable diligenceNo penalty shall be imposed by subparagraph (A) on any failure during any period for which it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the person otherwise liable for such penalty did not know, and exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, that such failure existed.
