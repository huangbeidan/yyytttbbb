				of the revitalization plan of the grantee.
								(C)Identification
				of green buildings rating systems and levels
							(i)In
				generalFor purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall
				identify rating systems and levels for green buildings that the Secretary
				determines to be the most likely to encourage a comprehensive and
				environmentally sound approach to ratings and standards for green buildings.
				The identification of the ratings systems and levels shall be based on the
				criteria specified in clause (ii), shall identify the highest levels the
				Secretary determines are appropriate above the minimum levels required under
				the systems selected. Within 90 days of the completion of each study required
				by clause (iii), the Secretary shall review and update the rating systems and
				levels, or identify alternative systems and levels for purposes of this
				paragraph, taking into account the conclusions of such study.
							(ii)CriteriaIn
				identifying the green rating systems and levels, the Secretary shall take into
				consideration—
								(I)the ability and
				availability of assessors and auditors to independently verify the criteria and
				measurement of metrics at the scale necessary to implement this
				paragraph;
								(II)the ability of
				the applicable ratings system organizations to collect and reflect public
				comment;
								(III)the ability of
				the standards to be developed and revised through a consensus-based

				sustainable use of water, energy, and other natural resources;
									(bb)use
				of renewable energy sources;
									(cc)improved indoor and outdoor environmental
				quality through enhanced indoor and outdoor air quality, thermal comfort,
				acoustics, outdoor noise pollution, day lighting, pollutant source control,
				sustainable landscaping, and use of building system controls and low- or
				no-emission materials, including preference for materials with no added
				carcinogens that are classified as Group 1 Known Carcinogens by the
				International Agency for Research on Cancer; and
									(dd)such other
				criteria as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; and
									(V)national
				recognition within the building industry.
								(iii)5-year
				evaluationAt least once every 5 years, the Secretary shall
				conduct a study to evaluate and compare available third-party green building
				rating systems and levels, taking into account the criteria listed in clause
				(ii).
							(D)Applicability
				and updating of standards
							(i)ApplicabilityExcept
				as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the national Green Communities
				criteria checklist and green building rating systems and levels referred to in
				clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) that are in effect for purposes of
				this paragraph are such checklist systems, and levels as in existence upon the
				date of the enactment of the Green Resources
				for Energy Efficient Neighborhoods Act of 2009.
							(ii)UpdatingThe
				Secretary may, by regulation, adopt and apply, for purposes of this paragraph,
				future amendments and supplements to, and editions of, the national Green
				Communities criteria checklist, any standard or standards that the Secretary
				has determined to be substantially equivalent to such checklist, and the green
				building ratings systems and levels identified by the Secretary pursuant to
				subparagraph
				(C).
