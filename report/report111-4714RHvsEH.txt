Such conditions shall ensure that, until the posting of a formal notice described in paragraph (1)(B), or until the information disclosed pursuant to this paragraph becomes publicly available by any other means, neither the entity represented by the party representative nor any other person may use such information in preparation for the prosecution of any claim or defense in litigation in connection with the accident being investigated or to make or deny any insurance claim in connection with such accident.

(h)Party representatives to NTSB investigations 
(1)Prohibition on disclosure of informationA party representative to an accident or marine casualty investigation of the Board is prohibited from disclosing, orally or in written form, investigative information, as defined by the Board, to anyone who is not an employee of the Board or who is not a party representative to such investigation, except— 
(A)as provided in paragraph (2); or 
(B)at the conclusion of the fact finding stage of an investigation, which the investigator-in-charge shall announce by formal posting of a notice in the publicly available investigation docket. 
(2)ExceptionIf the investigator-in-charge determines that a disclosure of information related to an accident or marine casualty investigation is necessary to prevent additional accidents or marine casualties, to address a perceived safety deficiency, or to assist in the conduct of the investigation, the investigator-in-charge may at any time authorize in writing a party representative to disclose such information under conditions approved by the investigator-in-charge. Such conditions shall ensure that, until the posting of a formal notice described in paragraph (1)(B), or until the information disclosed pursuant to this paragraph becomes publicly available by any other means, neither the entity represented by the party representative nor any other person may use such information in preparation for the prosecution of any claim or defense in litigation in connection with the accident or marine casualty being investigated or to make or deny any insurance claim in connection with such accident or marine casualty. 
(3)ComplianceThe Board shall require any individual who is a party representative to an investigation of the Board to sign a party agreement that includes language informing the individual of the prohibition in paragraph (1). 
(4)Representatives of Federal agenciesParagraph (3) shall not apply to an individual who is a representative of the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, or any other Federal department, agency, or instrumentality participating in the investigation and deemed by the Board to be performing a law enforcement or similar function. 
(5)Compliance with FAA statutory obligationsNothing in this subsection prohibits the Federal Aviation Administration from fulfilling statutory obligations to ensure safe operations. 
(6)Party representative definedIn this subsection, the term party representative means an individual representing a party to an investigation pursuant to section 831.11 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of enactment of this subsection..
