(1)by redesignating subsections (e), (f), and (g) as subsections (f), (g), and (h), respectively; and
(2)by inserting after subsection (d) the following new subsection:

(e)Prohibition on provision of deceptive caller identification information
(1)In generalIt shall be unlawful for any person within the United States, in connection with any telecommunications service or VOIP service, to cause any caller identification service to transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information, with the intent to defraud or cause harm.

(3)Regulations
(A)DeadlineNot later than 6 months after the enactment of this subsection, the Commission shall prescribe regulations to implement this subsection.
(B)Consideration of related regulationsIn conducting the proceeding to prescribe the regulations required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission shall examine whether the Commission’s regulations under subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section should be revised to require non-commercial calls to residential telephone lines using an artificial or pre-recorded voice to deliver a message to transmit caller identification information that is not misleading or inaccurate.
(4)DefinitionsFor purposes of this subsection:
