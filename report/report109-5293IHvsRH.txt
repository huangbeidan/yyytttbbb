				Secretary of Labor (hereafter in this title referred to as the
				Secretary) may establish an older American community service
				employment-based training program to foster and promote useful part-time public

				individuals who have poor employment prospects and to provide vital social and
				human services to communities through the placement of low-income individuals
				in community service activities.
						(b)(1)To carry out this title,
				the Secretary may make grants to public and nonprofit agencies and
				organizations, agencies of a State, and tribal organizations to carry out the
				program established under subsection (a). Such grants may provide for the

				to eligible individuals in service related to publicly owned and operated
				facilities and projects, or projects sponsored by profitmaking or nonprofit
				organizations (excluding political parties exempt from taxation under section
