			 disclosure reporting system
					(a)Voluntary Disclosure
			 Reporting Program definedIn
			 this section, the term ‘‘Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program’’ means the
			 program established by the Federal Aviation Administration through Advisory
			 Circular 00–58A, dated September 8, 2006, including any subsequent revisions
			 thereto.
					(b)VerificationThe
			 Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall modify the Voluntary
			 Disclosure Reporting Program to require inspectors to—
						(1)verify that air carriers
			 implement comprehensive solutions to correct the underlying causes of the
			 violations voluntarily disclosed by such air carriers; and
						(2)confirm, before approving
			 a final report of a violation, that the violation, or another violation
			 occurring under the same circumstances, has not been previously discovered by
			 an inspector or self-disclosed by the air carrier.
						(c)Supervisory review of
			 voluntary self disclosuresThe Administrator shall establish a
			 process by which voluntary self-disclosures received from air carriers are
			 reviewed and approved by a supervisor after the initial review by an
			 inspector.
					(d)GAO Study
						(1)In
			 generalThe Comptroller General shall conduct a study of the
			 Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program.
						(2)ReviewIn
			 conducting the study, the Comptroller General shall examine, at a minimum,
			 whether—
							(A)there is evidence that
			 voluntary disclosure is resulting in regulated entities discovering and
			 correcting violations to a greater extent than would otherwise occur if there
			 was no program for immunity from enforcement action;
							(B)the voluntary disclosure
			 program makes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aware of violations
			 that the FAA would not have discovered if there was not a program, and if a
			 violation is disclosed voluntarily, whether the FAA insists on stronger
			 corrective actions than would have occurred if the regulated entity knew of a
			 violation, but FAA did not;
							(C)the information the FAA
			 gets under the program leads to fewer violations by other entities, either
			 because the information leads other entities to look for similar violations or
			 because the information leads FAA investigators to look for similar violations
			 at other entities; and
							(D)there is any evidence
			 that voluntary disclosure has improved compliance with regulations, either for
			 the entities making disclosures or for the industry generally.
							(3)ReportNot
			 later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller
			 General shall submit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of
			 the House of Representatives and Committee on Commerce, Science, and
			 Transportation of the Senate a report on the results of the study conducted
			 under this section.

			 exemptions
				(a)StudyThe
			 Comptroller General shall conduct a study of the legal requirements and
			 policies followed by the Department in deciding whether to approve
			 international alliances under section 41309 of title 49, United States Code,
			 and grant exemptions from the antitrust laws under section 41308 of such title
			 in connection with such international alliances.
				(b)Issues To be
			 consideredIn conducting the study under subsection (a), the
			 Comptroller General, at a minimum, shall examine the following:
					(1)Whether granting
			 exemptions from the antitrust laws in connection with international alliances
			 has resulted in public benefits, including an analysis of whether such benefits
			 could have been achieved by international alliances not receiving exemptions
			 from the antitrust laws.
					(2)Whether granting exemptions from the
			 antitrust laws in connection with international alliances has resulted in
			 reduced competition, increased prices in markets, or other adverse
			 effects.
					(3)Whether international
			 alliances that have been granted exemptions from the antitrust laws have
			 implemented pricing or other practices with respect to the hub airports at
			 which the alliances operate that have resulted in increased costs for consumers
			 or foreclosed competition by rival (nonalliance) air carriers at such
			 airports.
					(4)Whether increased network
			 size resulting from additional international alliance members will adversely
			 affect competition between international alliances.
					(5)The areas in which
			 immunized international alliances compete and whether there is sufficient
			 competition among immunized international alliances to ensure that consumers
			 will receive benefits of at least the same magnitude as those that consumers
			 would receive if there were no immunized international alliances.
					(6)The minimum number of
			 international alliances that is necessary to ensure robust competition and
			 benefits to consumers on major international routes.
					(7)Whether the different
			 regulatory and antitrust responsibilities of the Secretary and the Attorney
			 General with respect to international alliances have created any significant
			 conflicting agency recommendations, such as the conditions imposed in granting
			 exemptions from the antitrust laws.
					(8)Whether, from an
			 antitrust standpoint, requests for exemptions from the antitrust laws in
			 connection with international alliances should be treated as mergers, and
			 therefore be exclusively subject to a traditional merger analysis by the
			 Attorney General and be subject to advance notification requirements and a
			 confidential review process similar to those required under section 7A of the
			 Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a).
					(9)Whether the Secretary should amend, modify,
			 or revoke any exemption from the antitrust laws granted by the Secretary in
			 connection with an international alliance.
					(10)The effect of
			 international alliances on the number and quality of jobs for United States air
			 carrier flight crew employees, including the share of alliance flying done by
			 those employees.
					(c)ReportNot later than one year after the date of
			 enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the Secretary of
			 Transportation, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House
			 of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
			 of the Senate a report on the results of the study under subsection (a),
			 including any recommendations of the Comptroller General as to whether there
			 should be changes in the authority of the Secretary under title 49, United
			 States Code, or policy changes that the Secretary can implement
			 administratively, with respect to approving international alliances and
			 granting exemptions from the antitrust laws in connection with such
			 international alliances.
				(d)Adoption of recommended
			 policy changesNot later than one year after the date of receipt
			 of the report under subsection (c), and after providing notice and an
			 opportunity for public comment, the Secretary shall issue a written
			 determination as to whether the Secretary will adopt the policy changes, if
			 any, recommended by the Comptroller General in the report or make any other
			 policy changes with respect to approving international alliances and granting
			 exemptions from the antitrust laws in connection with such international
			 alliances.
				(e)Sunset
			 provision
					(1)In
			 generalAn exemption from the antitrust laws granted by the
			 Secretary on or before the last day of the 3-year period beginning on the date
			 of enactment of this Act in connection with an international alliance,
			 including an exemption granted before the date of enactment of this Act, shall
			 cease to be effective after such last day unless the exemption is renewed by
			 the Secretary.
					(2)Timing for
			 renewalsThe Secretary may not renew an exemption under paragraph
			 (1) before the date on which the Secretary issues a written determination under
			 subsection (d).
					(3)Standards for
			 renewalsThe Secretary shall
			 make a decision on whether to renew an exemption under paragraph (1) based on
			 the policies of the Department in effect after the Secretary issues a written
			 determination under subsection (d).
					(f)DefinitionsIn this section, the following definitions
			 apply:
					(1)Exemption from the
			 antitrust lawsThe term exemption from the antitrust
			 laws means an exemption from the antitrust laws granted by the
			 Secretary under section 41308 of title 49, United States Code.
					(2)Immunized international
			 allianceThe term immunized international alliance
			 means an international alliance for which the Secretary has granted an
			 exemption from the antitrust laws.
					(3)International
			 allianceThe term international alliance means a
			 cooperative agreement between an air carrier and a foreign air carrier to
			 provide foreign air transportation subject to approval or disapproval by the
			 Secretary under section 41309 of title 49, United States Code.
					(4)DepartmentThe term Department means
			 the Department of Transportation.
					(5)SecretaryThe
			 term Secretary means the Secretary of Transportation.
