				stations outside the United States are subject to appropriate inspections that
				are based on identified risks and consistent with United States
				requirements;
									(2)accept consideration of
				inspection results and findings submitted by foreign civil aviation authorities
				operating under a maintenance safety or maintenance implementation agreement
				with the United States in meeting the requirements of the safety assessment
				system; and
									(3)require all maintenance
				safety or maintenance implementation agreements with the United States to
				provide an opportunity for the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct
				independent inspections of covered part 145 repair stations when safety
				concerns warrant such inspections.
									(b)Notice to Congress of
				negotiationsThe Administrator shall notify the Committee on
				Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on
				Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives on or before
				the 30th day after initiating formal negotiations with a foreign aviation

				safety or maintenance implementation agreement.
								(c)Annual
				reportNot later than one year after the date of enactment of
				this section, and annually thereafter, the Administrator shall publish a report
				on the Administration’s oversight of part 145 repair stations and
				implementation of the safety assessment system required by subsection (a),
				which shall—
									(1)describe in detail any
				improvements in the Federal Aviation Administration’s ability to identify and
				track where part 121 air carrier repair work is performed;
									(2)include a staffing model
				to determine the best placement of inspectors and the number of inspectors
				needed for the oversight and implementation;
									(3)describe the training
				provided to inspectors with respect to the oversight and implementation;
									(4)include an assessment of
				the quality of monitoring and surveillance by the Federal Aviation
				Administration of work provided by its inspectors and the inspectors of foreign
				authorities operating under a maintenance safety or maintenance implementation
				agreement with the United States; and
									(5)specify the number of
				sample inspections performed by Federal Aviation Administration inspectors at
				each repair station that is covered by a maintenance safety or maintenance
				implementation agreement with the United States.
									(d)Alcohol and controlled
				substance testing program requirements
									(1)In
				generalThe Secretary of State and the Secretary of
				Transportation shall request, jointly, the governments of foreign countries
				that are members of the International Civil Aviation Organization to establish
				international standards for alcohol and controlled substances testing of
				persons that perform safety-sensitive maintenance functions on commercial air
				carrier aircraft.
									(2)Application to part 121
				aircraft workNot later than one year after the date of enactment
				of this section, the Administrator shall promulgate a proposed rule requiring
				that all part 145 repair station employees responsible for safety-sensitive
				maintenance functions on part 121 air carrier aircraft are subject to an
				alcohol and controlled substances testing program that is determined acceptable
				by the Administrator and is consistent with the applicable laws of the country
				in which the repair station is located.
									(e)InspectionsThe
				Administrator shall require part 145 repair stations to be inspected as
				frequently as determined warranted by the safety assessment system required by
				subsection (a), regardless of where the station is located, and in a manner
				consistent with United States obligations under international
				agreements.
								(f)DefinitionsIn
				this section, the following definitions apply:
									(1)Part 121 air
				carrierThe term part 121 air carrier means an air
