									(A)InvestigationThe
				Director shall investigate entities that appear to be unlawful Internet
				gambling enterprises. An initial investigation shall be completed before the
				end of the 60-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this section.
				After the initial investigation, the Director shall regularly investigate
				entities that appear to be unlawful Internet gambling enterprises. If the
				Director discovers evidence sufficient to prove a prima facie case that any
				person is an unlawful Internet gambling enterprise, the Director shall provide
				the notice required under subparagraph (C).
									(B)RequestsAny Federal, State, tribal, or local law
				enforcement official, any affected sports organization, any person directly
				harmed by unlawful Internet gambling, any financial transaction provider, and
				any interactive computer service (as such terms are defined in section 5362)
				shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make a written request to the
				Director for the addition of any person to the list of unlawful Internet
				gambling enterprises. If the Director determines that the evidence submitted is
				sufficient to prove a prima facie case that such person is an unlawful Internet
				gambling enterprise, the Director shall provide the notice required under
				subparagraph (C) to each person identified as an alleged unlawful Internet
				gambling enterprise. The Director also shall provide written notice of its
				decision under this subparagraph, including a decision not to add a person to
				the list required under paragraph (1), to the requesting party no later than 30
				days after the request is received.
									(C)NoticeNot
				fewer than 30 days before adding an unlawful Internet gambling enterprise, or
				an owner or operator thereof, to the list required under paragraph (1), the
				Director shall provide written notice to such enterprise, owner, or operator.
				Any enterprise, owner, or operator receiving such notice may contest the
				Director’s determination by written appeal to the Director not more than 30
				days after receiving notice.
									(D)Opportunity for
				hearingIf a person properly submits a written appeal under
				subparagraph (C), the Director shall not include such person in the list
				required under paragraph (1) unless and until the Director provides such person
				with an opportunity for a hearing not more than 30 days after receiving written
				notice of appeal. Not more than 10 days after an opportunity for hearing is
				afforded, whether or not the person requesting the hearing appears at such
				hearing, the Director shall proceed to add such person to the list of unlawful
				Internet gambling enterprises unless the Director determines, based on a
				preponderance of the evidence, that such person is not an unlawful Internet
				gambling enterprise.
									(E)Injunctive
				reliefAny person that the Director determines shall be included
				in the list required under paragraph (1) after such person appears at a hearing
				described in subparagraph (D) and any person included in such list who did not
				receive the notice required under subparagraph (C), may petition for injunctive
				relief in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which
				shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear challenges pursuant to this section.
				The petitioner shall have the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the
				evidence that such person is not an unlawful Internet gambling enterprise. Only
				persons designated by the Director for inclusion on the list of unlawful
				Internet gambling enterprises, and other owners or operators of an enterprise
				to be so listed, shall have standing to contest the Director’s determination.
				The court may enjoin the Director and the Secretary not to add or remove the
				petitioner from the list of unlawful Internet gambling enterprises, and no
				other judicial recourse shall be permitted.
