				net increase for such fiscal year in the negative credit subsidy for the
				mortgage insurance programs under title II of the National Housing Act
				resulting from the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007, and the
				amendments made by such Act, is first made available for the following purposes
				in the following amounts:
									(A)Single family housing
				mortgage insuranceFor each fiscal year, for costs (as such term
				is defined in section 502 of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C.
				661a)) of mortgage insurance provided pursuant to section 203(b) of the
				National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)), the additional amount (not including
				any costs of such mortgage insurance resulting from this Act or the amendments
				made by this Act), if any, necessary to ensure that the credit subsidy cost of
				such mortgage insurance for such fiscal year is $0.
									(B)Housing
				counselingFor each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012, the amount
				needed to increase funding, for the housing counseling program under section
				106 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x), in
				connection with homebuyers and homeowners with mortgages insured under title II
				of the National Housing Act, from the amount appropriated for the preceding
				fiscal year to $100,000,000.
									(C)Mortgage insurance
				technology, procedures, processes, program performance, and
				salariesFor each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012, $25,000,000
				for increasing funding for the purpose of improving technology, procedures,
				processes, and program performance, and salaries in connection with the
				mortgage insurance programs under title II of the National Housing Act.
									(2)Exclusion of Earnings
				From the Single Family Mortgage Insurance ProgramNo funds under
				paragraph (2) of subsection (b) for a fiscal year may be derived from the
				negative credit subsidy cost for such fiscal year, if any, for mortgage
				insurance provided pursuant to section 203(b) of the National Housing
				Act.
								(3)CertificationNo
				funds may be made available under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) for any
				fiscal year unless the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has, by rule
				making in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code
				(notwithstanding subsections (a)(2), (b)(B), and (d)(3) of such section), made
				a determination that premiums being, or to be, charged during such fiscal year
				for mortgage insurance under title II of the National Housing Act are
				established at the minimum amount sufficient to comply with the requirements of
				section 205(f) of such Act (relating to required capital ratio for the Mutual
				Mortgage Insurance Fund) and ensure the safety and soundness of the other
				mortgage insurance funds under such Act, and any negative credit subsidy for
				such fiscal year resulting from such mortgage insurance programs adequately
				ensures the efficient delivery and availability of such programs.
								(4)Limitation on mortgage
				insurance premium increasesNotwithstanding any other provision of
				lawâ€”
									(A)the premiums charged for
				mortgage insurance under any program under the National Housing Act may not be
				increased above the premium amounts in effect under such program on October 1,
				2006, unless the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines that,
				absent such increase, insurance of additional mortgages under such program
				would, under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, require the appropriation
				of new budget authority to cover the costs (as such term is defined in section
				502 of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a) of such insurance;
				and
									(B)a premium increase
				pursuant to paragraph (1) may be made only by rule making in accordance with
				the procedures under section 553 of title 5, United States Code
				(notwithstanding subsections (a)(2), (b)(B), and (d)(3) of such
				section).
