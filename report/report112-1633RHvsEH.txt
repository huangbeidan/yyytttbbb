(a)Analysis of impacts of actions on employment and economic activity in the agriculture community
(1)AnalysisBefore taking a covered action, the Administrator shall analyze the impact, disaggregated by State, of the covered action on—
(A)employment levels in the agriculture industry; and
(B)agricultural economic activity, including estimated job losses and decreased economic activity related to agriculture.
(2)Economic models
(A)In generalIn carrying out paragraph (1), the Administrator shall utilize the best available economic models.
(B)Annual GAO reportNot later than December 31 of each year, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the economic models used by the Administrator to carry out this subsection.
(3)Availability of informationWith respect to any covered action, the Administrator shall—
(A)post the analysis under paragraph (1) as a link on the main page of the public Internet Web site of the Environmental Protection Agency;
(B)request the Secretary of Agriculture to post the analysis under paragraph (1) as a link on the main page of the public Internet Web site of the Department of Agriculture; and
(C)request that the Governor of any State experiencing more than a de minimis negative impact post such analysis in the Capitol of such State.
(b)Public hearings
(1)In generalIf the Administrator concludes under subsection (a)(1) that a covered action will have more than a de minimis negative impact on agricultural employment levels or agricultural economic activity in a State, the Administrator shall hold a public hearing in each such State at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the covered action.
(2)Time, location, and selectionA public hearing required under paragraph (1) shall be held at a convenient time and location for impacted residents. In selecting a location for such a public hearing, the Administrator shall give priority to locations in the State that will experience the greatest number of job losses.
(c)NotificationIf the Administrator concludes under subsection (a)(1) that a covered action will have more than a de minimis negative impact on agricultural employment levels or agricultural economic activity in any State, the Administrator shall give notice of such impact to the State’s Congressional delegation, Governor, and Legislature at least 45 days before the effective date of the covered action.
(d)DefinitionsIn this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)AdministratorThe term Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
(2)Covered actionThe term covered action means any of the following actions taken by the Administrator under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) relating to agriculture and the national primary ambient air quality standard or the national secondary ambient air quality standard for particulate matter:
(A)Issuing a regulation, policy statement, guidance, response to a petition, or other requirement.
(B)Implementing a new or substantially altered program.
(3)More than a de minimis negative impactThe term more than a de minimis negative impact means the following:
(A)With respect to employment levels, a loss of more than 100 jobs related to the agriculture industry. Any offsetting job gains that result from the hypothetical creation of new jobs through new technologies or government employment may not be used in the job loss calculation.
(B)With respect to economic activity, a decrease in agricultural economic activity of more than $1,000,000 over any calendar year. Any offsetting economic activity that results from the hypothetical creation of new economic activity through new technologies or government employment may not be used in the economic activity calculation."}

(C)request that the Governor of any State experiencing more than a de minimis negative impact post such analysis in the Capitol of such State.
(b)Public hearings
(1)In generalIf the Administrator concludes under subsection (a)(1) that a covered action will have more than a de minimis negative impact on agricultural employment levels or agricultural economic activity in a State, the Administrator shall hold a public hearing in each such State at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the covered action.
(2)Time, location, and selectionA public hearing required under paragraph (1) shall be held at a convenient time and location for impacted residents. In selecting a location for such a public hearing, the Administrator shall give priority to locations in the State that will experience the greatest number of job losses.
(c)NotificationIf the Administrator concludes under subsection (a)(1) that a covered action will have more than a de minimis negative impact on agricultural employment levels or agricultural economic activity in any State, the Administrator shall give notice of such impact to the State’s Congressional delegation, Governor, and Legislature at least 45 days before the effective date of the covered action.

Any offsetting economic activity that results from the hypothetical creation of new economic activity through new technologies or government employment may not be used in the economic activity calculation."}
