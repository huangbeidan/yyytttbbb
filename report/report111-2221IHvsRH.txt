(A)Accuracy
(i)In generalEach information broker shall establish reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible accuracy of the personal information it collects, assembles, or maintains, and any other information it collects, assembles, or maintains that specifically identifies an individual, other than information which merely identifies an individual’s name or address.
(ii)Limited exception for fraud databasesThe requirement in clause (i) shall not prevent the collection or maintenance of information that may be inaccurate with respect to a particular individual when that information is being collected or maintained solely—
(I)for the purpose of indicating whether there may be a discrepancy or irregularity in the personal information that is associated with an individual; and 
(II)to help identify, or authenticate the identity of, an individual, or to protect against or investigate fraud or other unlawful conduct.
(B)Consumer access to information
(i)AccessEach information broker shall—
(I)provide to each individual whose personal information it maintains, at the individual’s request at least 1 time per year and at no cost to the individual, and after verifying the identity of such individual, a means for the individual to review any personal information regarding such individual maintained by the information broker and any other information maintained by the information broker that specifically identifies such individual, other than information which merely identifies an individual’s name or address; and
(II)place a conspicuous notice on its Internet website (if the information broker maintains such a website) instructing individuals how to request access to the information required to be provided under subclause (I), and, as applicable, how to express a preference with respect to the use of personal information for marketing purposes under clause (iii).
(ii)Disputed informationWhenever an individual whose information the information broker maintains makes a written request disputing the accuracy of any such information, the information broker, after verifying the identity of the individual making such request and unless there are reasonable grounds to believe such request is frivolous or irrelevant, shall—
(I)correct any inaccuracy; or
(II)
(aa)in the case of information that is public record information, inform the individual of the source of the information, and, if reasonably available, where a request for correction may be directed and, if the individual provides proof that the public record has been corrected or that the information broker was reporting the information incorrectly, correct the inaccuracy in the information broker’s records; or
(bb)in the case of information that is non-public information, note the information that is disputed, including the individual’s statement disputing such information, and take reasonable steps to independently verify such information under the procedures outlined in subparagraph (A) if such information can be independently verified.
(iii)Alternative procedure for certain marketing informationIn accordance with regulations issued under clause (v), an information broker that maintains any information described in clause (i) which is used, shared, or sold by such information broker for marketing purposes, may, in lieu of complying with the access and dispute requirements set forth in clauses (i) and (ii), provide each individual whose information it maintains with a reasonable means of expressing a preference not to have his or her information used for such purposes. If the individual expresses such a preference, the information broker may not use, share, or sell the individual’s information for marketing purposes.
(iv)LimitationsAn information broker may limit the access to information required under subparagraph (B)(i)(I) and is not required to provide notice to individuals as required under subparagraph (B)(i)(II) in the following circumstances:
(I)If access of the individual to the information is limited by law or legally recognized privilege.
(II)If the information is used for a legitimate governmental or fraud prevention purpose that would be compromised by such access.
(III)If the information consists of a published media record, unless that record has been included in a report about an individual shared with a third party.
(v)RulemakingNot later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall promulgate regulations under section 553 of title 5, United States Code, to carry out this paragraph and to facilitate the purposes of this Act. In addition, the Commission shall issue regulations, as necessary, under section 553 of title 5, United States Code, on the scope of the application of the limitations in clause (iv), including any additional circumstances in which an information broker may limit access to information under such clause that the Commission determines to be appropriate.
