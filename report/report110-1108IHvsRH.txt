				validation (including a process to assess the performance of a tobacco
				product), packing, and storage of a tobacco product conform to current good
				manufacturing practice, or hazard analysis and critical control point
				methodology, as prescribed in such regulations to assure that the public health
				is protected and that the tobacco product is in compliance with this chapter.
				Such regulations may provide for the testing of raw tobacco for pesticide
				chemical residues regardless of whether a tolerance for such chemical residues
				has been established.

				for an exemption from a requirement, set forth the basis for the petitioner’s
				determination that compliance with the requirement is not required to assure
				that the tobacco product will be in compliance with this chapter;
												(ii)in the case of a
				petition for a variance from a requirement, set forth the methods proposed to
				be used in, and the facilities and controls proposed to be used for, the
				manufacture, packing, and storage of the tobacco product in lieu of the
				methods, facilities, and controls prescribed by the requirement; and
												(iii)contain such other
				information as the Secretary shall prescribe.

				methods, facilities, and controls prescribed by the requirement are sufficient
				to assure that the tobacco product will be in compliance with this
				chapter.
												(D)ConditionsAn
				order of the Secretary approving a petition for a variance shall prescribe such
				conditions respecting the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used
				for, the manufacture, packing, and storage of the tobacco product to be granted
				the variance under the petition as may be necessary to assure that the tobacco

				standards
									(a)In general
										(1)Special rules
											(A)Special rule for
				cigarettesBeginning 3 months
				after the date of enactment of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco
				Control Act, a cigarette or any of its component parts (including the tobacco,
				filter, or paper) shall not contain, as a constituent (including a smoke
				constituent) or additive, an artificial or natural flavor (other than tobacco
				or menthol) or an herb or spice, including strawberry, grape, orange, clove,
				cinnamon, pineapple, vanilla, coconut, licorice, cocoa, chocolate, cherry, or
				coffee, that is a characterizing flavor of the tobacco product or tobacco
				smoke. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to limit the Secretary’s
				authority to take action under this section or other sections of this Act
				applicable to menthol or any artificial or natural flavor, herb, or spice not
				specified in this subparagraph. For purposes of this section, a cigarette or
				any of its component parts has a characterizing flavor if the cigarette, its
				tobacco smoke, or the component part imparts a distinguishable taste or aroma
				other than tobacco or menthol either prior to consumption or during
				consumption, or is advertised or marketed as having or producing a flavor,
				taste, or aroma other than tobacco or menthol.
											(B)Additional special
				ruleNo tobacco product
				manufactured in or imported into the United States shall contain foreign-grown
				tobacco that—
												(i)contains a level of any
				pesticide chemical residue in excess of any maximum permissible residue level
				that is applicable to domestically grown tobacco; or
												(ii)was grown or processed
				using any pesticide chemical not approved under Federal law for use in domestic
				tobacco farming or processing.

				generalThe Secretary may adopt tobacco product standards in
				addition to those in paragraph (1) if the Secretary finds that a tobacco
				product standard is appropriate for the protection of the public health.
											(B)Determinations
												(i)ConsiderationsIn making a finding described in
				subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider scientific evidence
				concerning—
													(I)the risks and benefits to
				the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of tobacco products, of
				the proposed standard;
													(II)the increased or
				decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using
				such products; and
													(III)the increased or
				decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start
				using such products.
													(ii)Additional
				considerationsIn the event
				that the Secretary makes a determination, set forth in a proposed tobacco
				product standard in a proposed rule, that it is appropriate for the protection
				of public health to require the reduction or elimination of an additive,
				constituent (including a smoke constituent), or other component of a tobacco
				product because the Secretary has found that the additive, constituent, or
				other component is or may be harmful, any party objecting to the proposed
				standard on the ground that the proposed standard will not reduce or eliminate
				the risk of illness or injury may provide for the Secretary’s consideration
				scientific evidence that demonstrates that the proposed standard will not
				reduce or eliminate the risk of illness or injury.
												(4)Content of tobacco
				product standardsA tobacco product standard established under
				this section for a tobacco product—
											(A)shall include provisions
				that are appropriate for the protection of the public health, including

												(iii)provisions for the
				measurement of the tobacco product characteristics of the tobacco
				product;
												(iv)provisions requiring
				that the results of each or of certain of the tests of the tobacco product
				required to be made under clause (ii) show that the tobacco product is in
				conformity with the portions of the standard for which the test or tests were
				required; and
												(v)a provision requiring
				that the sale and distribution of the tobacco product be restricted but only to
				the extent that the sale and distribution of a tobacco product may be
				restricted under a regulation under section 906(d);
												(C)shall, where appropriate,
				require the use and prescribe the form and content of labeling for the proper
				use of the tobacco product; and

				foreign-grown tobacco to meet the same standards applicable to tobacco products
				containing domestically grown tobacco.
											(5)Periodic reevaluation
				of tobacco product standardsThe Secretary shall provide for
				periodic evaluation of tobacco product standards established under this section
				to determine whether such standards should be changed to reflect new medical,
				scientific, or other technological data. The Secretary may provide for testing
				under paragraph (4)(B) by any person.

				Federal agencies concerned with standard setting and other nationally or
				internationally recognized standard-setting entities; and
											(C)invite appropriate
				participation, through joint or other conferences, workshops, or other means,
				by informed persons representative of scientific, professional, industry,
				agricultural, or consumer organizations who in the Secretary’s judgment can
				make a significant contribution.
											(b)Considerations by
				Secretary
										(1)Technical
				achievabilityThe Secretary
				shall consider information submitted in connection with a proposed standard
				regarding the technical achievability of compliance with such standard.
										(2)Other
				considerationsThe Secretary shall consider all other information
				submitted in connection with a proposed standard, including information
				concerning the countervailing effects of the tobacco product standard on the
				health of adolescent tobacco users, adult tobacco users, or nontobacco users,
				such as the creation of a significant demand for contraband or other tobacco
				products that do not meet the requirements of this chapter and the significance
				of such demand.
										(c)Proposed
				standards
										(1)In
				generalThe Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a
				notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment, amendment, or revocation
				of any tobacco product standard.
										(2)Requirements of
				noticeA notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment or
				amendment of a tobacco product standard for a tobacco product shall—
											(A)set forth a finding with
				supporting justification that the tobacco product standard is appropriate for
				the protection of the public health;
											(B)invite interested persons
				to submit a draft or proposed tobacco product standard for consideration by the
				Secretary;
											(C)invite interested persons to submit
				comments on structuring the standard so that it does not advantage
				foreign-grown tobacco over domestically grown tobacco; and
											(D)invite the Secretary of Agriculture to
				provide any information or analysis which the Secretary of Agriculture believes
				is relevant to the proposed tobacco product standard.
											(3)FindingA
				notice of proposed rulemaking for the revocation of a tobacco product standard
				shall set forth a finding with supporting justification that the tobacco
				product standard is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public
				health.
										(4)CommentThe
				Secretary shall provide for a comment period of not less than 60 days.
										(d)Promulgation
										(1)In
				generalAfter the expiration
				of the period for comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking published under
				subsection (c) respecting a tobacco product standard and after consideration of
				comments submitted under subsections (b) and (c) and any report from the
				Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, if the Secretary determines
				that the standard would be appropriate for the protection of the public health,
				the Secretary shall—
											(A)promulgate a regulation
				establishing a tobacco product standard and publish in the Federal Register
				findings on the matters referred to in subsection (c); or
											(B)publish a notice
				terminating the proceeding for the development of the standard together with
				the reasons for such termination.
											(2)Effective
				dateA regulation
				establishing a tobacco product standard shall set forth the date or dates upon
				which the standard shall take effect, but no such regulation may take effect
				before 1 year after the date of its publication unless the Secretary determines
				that an earlier effective date is necessary for the protection of the public
				health. Such date or dates shall be established so as to minimize, consistent
				with the public health, economic loss to, and disruption or dislocation of,
				domestic and international trade. In establishing such effective date or dates,
				the Secretary shall consider information submitted in connection with a
				proposed product standard by interested parties, including manufacturers and
				tobacco growers, regarding the technical achievability of compliance with the
				standard, and including information concerning the existence of patents that
				make it impossible to comply in the timeframe envisioned in the proposed
				standard. If the Secretary determines, based on the Secretary’s evaluation of
				submitted comments, that a product standard can be met only by manufacturers
				requiring substantial changes to the methods of farming the domestically grown
				tobacco used by the manufacturer, the effective date of that product standard
				shall be not less than 2 years after the date of publication of the final
				regulation establishing the standard.
										(3)Limitation on power
				granted to the Food and Drug AdministrationBecause of the
				importance of a decision of the Secretary to issue a regulation—
											(A)banning all cigarettes,
				all smokeless tobacco products, all little cigars, all cigars other than little
				cigars, all pipe tobacco, or all roll-your-own tobacco products; or
											(B)requiring the reduction
				of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero,
											the
				Secretary is prohibited from taking such actions under this Act.(4)Amendment;
				revocation
											(A)AuthorityThe
				Secretary, upon the Secretary’s own initiative or upon petition of an
				interested person, may by a regulation, promulgated in accordance with the
				requirements of subsection (c) and paragraph (2), amend or revoke a tobacco
				product standard.
											(B)Effective
				dateThe Secretary may declare a proposed amendment of a tobacco
				product standard to be effective on and after its publication in the Federal
				Register and until the effective date of any final action taken on such
				amendment if the Secretary determines that making it so effective is in the
				public interest.
											(5)Referral to advisory
				committee
											(A)In
				generalThe Secretary may refer a proposed regulation for the
				establishment, amendment, or revocation of a tobacco product standard to the
				Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee for a report and recommendation
				with respect to any matter involved in the proposed regulation which requires
				the exercise of scientific judgment.
											(B)Initiation of
				referralThe Secretary may make a referral under this
				paragraph—
												(i)on the Secretary’s own
				initiative; or
												(ii)upon the request of an
				interested person that—
													(I)demonstrates good cause
				for the referral; and
													(II)is made before the
				expiration of the period for submission of comments on the proposed
				regulation.
													(C)Provision of
				dataIf a proposed regulation is referred under this paragraph to
				the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, the Secretary shall provide
				the Advisory Committee with the data and information on which such proposed
				regulation is based.
											(D)Report and
				recommendationThe Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee
				shall, within 60 days after the referral of a proposed regulation under this
				paragraph and after independent study of the data and information furnished to
				it by the Secretary and other data and information before it, submit to the
				Secretary a report and recommendation respecting such regulation, together with
				all underlying data and information and a statement of the reason or basis for
				the recommendation.
											(E)Public
				availabilityThe Secretary shall make a copy of each report and
				recommendation under subparagraph (D) publicly available.
											908.Notification and other
				remedies
									(a)NotificationIf
				the Secretary determines that—
										(1)a tobacco product which
				is introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for
				commercial distribution presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to
				the public health; and
										(2)notification under this
				subsection is necessary to eliminate the unreasonable risk of such harm and no
				more practicable means is available under the provisions of this chapter (other
				than this section) to eliminate such risk,
										the
				Secretary may issue such order as may be necessary to assure that adequate
				notification is provided in an appropriate form, by the persons and means best
				suited under the circumstances involved, to all persons who should properly
				receive such notification in order to eliminate such risk. The Secretary may
				order notification by any appropriate means, including public service
				announcements. Before issuing an order under this subsection, the Secretary
				shall consult with the persons who are to give notice under the order.(b)No Exemption From Other
				LiabilityCompliance with an order issued under this section
				shall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law. In
				awarding damages for economic loss in an action brought for the enforcement of
				any such liability, the value to the plaintiff in such action of any remedy
				provided under such order shall be taken into account.
									(c)Recall
				Authority
										(1)In
				generalIf the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable
				probability that a tobacco product contains a manufacturing or other defect not
				ordinarily contained in tobacco products on the market that would cause
				serious, adverse health consequences or death, the Secretary shall issue an
				order requiring the appropriate person (including the manufacturers, importers,
				distributors, or retailers of the tobacco product) to immediately cease
				distribution of such tobacco product. The order shall provide the person
				subject to the order with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held
				not later than 10 days after the date of the issuance of the order, on the
				actions required by the order and on whether the order should be amended to
				require a recall of such tobacco product. If, after providing an opportunity
				for such a hearing, the Secretary determines that inadequate grounds exist to
				support the actions required by the order, the Secretary shall vacate the
				order.
										(2)Amendment of order to
				require recall
											(A)In
				generalIf, after providing an opportunity for an informal
				hearing under paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that the order should be
				amended to include a recall of the tobacco product with respect to which the
				order was issued, the Secretary shall, except as provided in subparagraph (B),
				amend the order to require a recall. The Secretary shall specify a timetable in
				which the tobacco product recall will occur and shall require periodic reports
				to the Secretary describing the progress of the recall.
											(B)NoticeAn
				amended order under subparagraph (A)—
												(i)shall not include recall
				of a tobacco product from individuals; and
												(ii)shall provide for notice
				to persons subject to the risks associated with the use of such tobacco
				product.
												In
				providing the notice required by clause (ii), the Secretary may use the
				assistance of retailers and other persons who distributed such tobacco product.
				If a significant number of such persons cannot be identified, the Secretary
				shall notify such persons under section 705(b).(3)Remedy not
				exclusiveThe remedy provided by this subsection shall be in
				addition to remedies provided by subsection (a).
										909.Records and reports on
				tobacco products
									(a)In
				GeneralEvery person who is a tobacco product manufacturer or
				importer of a tobacco product shall establish and maintain such records, make
				such reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary may by regulation
				reasonably require to assure that such tobacco product is not adulterated or
				misbranded and to otherwise protect public health. Regulations prescribed under
				the preceding sentence—
										(1)may require a tobacco
				product manufacturer or importer to report to the Secretary whenever the
				manufacturer or importer receives or otherwise becomes aware of information
				that reasonably suggests that one of its marketed tobacco products may have
				caused or contributed to a serious unexpected adverse experience associated
				with the use of the product or any significant increase in the frequency of a
				serious, expected adverse product experience;
										(2)shall require reporting
				of other significant adverse tobacco product experiences as determined by the
				Secretary to be necessary to be reported;
										(3)shall not impose
				requirements unduly burdensome to a tobacco product manufacturer or importer,
				taking into account the cost of complying with such requirements and the need
				for the protection of the public health and the implementation of this
				chapter;
										(4)when prescribing the
				procedure for making requests for reports or information, shall require that
				each request made under such regulations for submission of a report or
				information to the Secretary state the reason or purpose for such request and
				identify to the fullest extent practicable such report or information;
										(5)when requiring submission
				of a report or information to the Secretary, shall state the reason or purpose
				for the submission of such report or information and identify to the fullest
				extent practicable such report or information; and
										(6)may not require that the
				identity of any patient or user be disclosed in records, reports, or
				information required under this subsection unless required for the medical
				welfare of an individual, to determine risks to public health of a tobacco
				product, or to verify a record, report, or information submitted under this
				chapter.
										In
				prescribing regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall have due
				regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests
				of patients. The prohibitions of paragraph (6) continue to apply to records,
				reports, and information concerning any individual who has been a patient,
				irrespective of whether or when he ceases to be a patient.(b)Reports of Removals and
				Corrections
										(1)In
				generalExcept as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall
				by regulation require a tobacco product manufacturer or importer of a tobacco
				product to report promptly to the Secretary any corrective action taken or
				removal from the market of a tobacco product undertaken by such manufacturer or
				importer if the removal or correction was undertaken—
											(A)to reduce a risk to
				health posed by the tobacco product; or
											(B)to remedy a violation of
				this chapter caused by the tobacco product which may present a risk to
				health.
											A
				tobacco product manufacturer or importer of a tobacco product who undertakes a
				corrective action or removal from the market of a tobacco product which is not
				required to be reported under this subsection shall keep a record of such
				correction or removal.(2)ExceptionNo
				report of the corrective action or removal of a tobacco product may be required
				under paragraph (1) if a report of the corrective action or removal is required
				and has been submitted under subsection (a).
										910.Application for review
				of certain tobacco products
									(a)In general
										(1)New tobacco product
				definedFor purposes of this section the term new tobacco
				product means—
											(A)any tobacco product
				(including those products in test markets) that was not commercially marketed
				in the United States as of February 15, 2007; or
											(B)any modification
				(including a change in design, any component, any part, or any constituent,
				including a smoke constituent, or in the content, delivery or form of nicotine,
				or any other additive or ingredient) of a tobacco product where the modified
				product was commercially marketed in the United States after February 15,
				2007.
											(2)Premarket review
				required
											(A)New
				productsAn order under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) for a new tobacco
				product is required unless—
												(i)the manufacturer has

				that the tobacco product—
													(I)is substantially
				equivalent to a tobacco product commercially marketed (other than for test
				marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007; and
													(II)is in compliance with
				the requirements of this Act; or
													(ii)the tobacco product is
				exempt from the requirements of section 905(j) pursuant to a regulation issued
				under section 905(j)(3).
												(B)Application to certain
				post-February 15, 2007, productsSubparagraph (A) shall not apply
				to a tobacco product—
												(i)that was first introduced
				or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial
				distribution in the United States after February 15, 2007, and prior to the
				date that is 21 months after the date of enactment of the Family Smoking
				Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; and
												(ii)for which a report was
				submitted under section 905(j) within such 21-month period,
												except that subparagraph (A) shall apply
				to the tobacco product if the Secretary issues an order that the tobacco
				product is not substantially equivalent.(3)Substantially
				equivalent defined
											(A)In
				generalIn this section and section 905(j), the term
				substantially equivalent or substantial equivalence
				means, with respect to the tobacco product being compared to the predicate
				tobacco product, that the Secretary by order has found that the tobacco
				product—
												(i)has the same
				characteristics as the predicate tobacco product; or
												(ii)has different
				characteristics and the information submitted contains information, including
				clinical data if deemed necessary by the Secretary, that demonstrates that it
				is not appropriate to regulate the product under this section because the
				product does not raise different questions of public health.
												(B)CharacteristicsIn
				subparagraph (A), the term characteristics means the materials,
				ingredients, design, composition, heating source, or other features of a
				tobacco product.
											(C)LimitationA
				tobacco product may not be found to be substantially equivalent to a predicate
				tobacco product that has been removed from the market at the initiative of the
				Secretary or that has been determined by a judicial order to be misbranded or
				adulterated.
											(4)Health
				information
											(A)SummaryAs
				part of a submission under section 905(j) respecting a tobacco product, the
				person required to file a premarket notification under such section shall

				informationAny summary under subparagraph (A) respecting a
				tobacco product shall contain detailed information regarding data concerning
				adverse health effects and shall be made available to the public by the
				Secretary within 30 days of the issuance of a determination that such tobacco
				product is substantially equivalent to another tobacco product.
											(b)Application
										(1)ContentsAn
				application under this section shall contain—
											(A)full reports of all
				information, published or known to, or which should reasonably be known to, the
				applicant, concerning investigations which have been made to show the health

				risk than other tobacco products;
											(B)a full statement of the
				components, ingredients, additives, and properties, and of the principle or
				principles of operation, of such tobacco product;
											(C)a full description of the
				methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture,
				processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, such tobacco
				product;
											(D)an identifying reference
				to any tobacco product standard under section 907 which would be applicable to
				any aspect of such tobacco product, and either adequate information to show
				that such aspect of such tobacco product fully meets such tobacco product
				standard or adequate information to justify any deviation from such
				standard;
											(E)such samples of such
				tobacco product and of components thereof as the Secretary may reasonably
				require;
											(F)specimens of the labeling
				proposed to be used for such tobacco product; and

				application meeting the requirements set forth in paragraph (1), the
				Secretary—
											(A)may, on the Secretary’s
				own initiative; or
											(B)may, upon the request of
				an applicant,
											refer
				such application to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee for
				reference and for submission (within such period as the Secretary may
				establish) of a report and recommendation respecting the application, together
				with all underlying data and the reasons or basis for the
				recommendation.(c)Action on
				Application
										(1)Deadline
											(A)In
				generalAs promptly as possible, but in no event later than 180
				days after the receipt of an application under subsection (b), the Secretary,
				after considering the report and recommendation submitted under subsection
				(b)(2), shall—
												(i)issue an order that the
				new product may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate
				commerce if the Secretary finds that none of the grounds specified in paragraph
				(2) of this subsection applies; or
												(ii)issue an order that the
				new product may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate
				commerce if the Secretary finds (and sets forth the basis for such finding as
				part of or accompanying such denial) that 1 or more grounds for denial
				specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection apply.
												(B)Restrictions on sale
				and distributionAn order under subparagraph (A)(i) may require
				that the sale and distribution of the tobacco product be restricted but only to
				the extent that the sale and distribution of a tobacco product may be
				restricted under a regulation under section 906(d).
											(2)Denial of
				applicationThe Secretary shall deny an application submitted
				under subsection (b) if, upon the basis of the information submitted to the
				Secretary as part of the application and any other information before the
				Secretary with respect to such tobacco product, the Secretary finds
				that—
											(A)there is a lack of a
				showing that permitting such tobacco product to be marketed would be
				appropriate for the protection of the public health;
											(B)the methods used in, or
				the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, processing, or packing of
				such tobacco product do not conform to the requirements of section
				906(e);
											(C)based on a fair
				evaluation of all material facts, the proposed labeling is false or misleading
				in any particular; or
											(D)such tobacco product is
				not shown to conform in all respects to a tobacco product standard in effect
				under section 907, and there is a lack of adequate information to justify the
				deviation from such standard.
											(3)Denial
				informationAny denial of an application shall, insofar as the
				Secretary determines to be practicable, be accompanied by a statement informing
				the applicant of the measures required to remove such application from deniable
				form (which measures may include further research by the applicant in
				accordance with 1 or more protocols prescribed by the Secretary).
										(4)Basis for
				findingFor purposes of this section, the finding as to whether
				the marketing of a tobacco product for which an application has been submitted
				is appropriate for the protection of the public health shall be determined with
				respect to the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users
				and nonusers of the tobacco product, and taking into account—
											(A)the increased or
				decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using
				such products; and
											(B)the increased or
				decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start
				using such products.
											(5)Basis for
				action
											(A)InvestigationsFor
				purposes of paragraph (2)(A), whether permitting a tobacco product to be
				marketed would be appropriate for the protection of the public health shall,
				when appropriate, be determined on the basis of well-controlled investigations,
				which may include 1 or more clinical investigations by experts qualified by
				training and experience to evaluate the tobacco product.
											(B)Other
				evidenceIf the Secretary determines that there exists valid
				scientific evidence (other than evidence derived from investigations described
				in subparagraph (A)) which is sufficient to evaluate the tobacco product, the
				Secretary may authorize that the determination for purposes of paragraph (2)(A)
				be made on the basis of such evidence.
											(d)Withdrawal and
				Temporary Suspension
										(1)In
				generalThe Secretary shall, upon obtaining, where appropriate,
				advice on scientific matters from the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory
				Committee, and after due notice and opportunity for informal hearing for a
				tobacco product for which an order was issued under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i),
				issue an order withdrawing the order if the Secretary finds—
											(A)that the continued
				marketing of such tobacco product no longer is appropriate for the protection
				of the public health;
											(B)that the application
				contained or was accompanied by an untrue statement of a material fact;
											(C)that the
				applicant—
												(i)has failed to establish a
				system for maintaining records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to
				maintain records or to make reports, required by an applicable regulation under
				section 909;
												(ii)has refused to permit
				access to, or copying or verification of, such records as required by section
				704; or
												(iii)has not complied with
				the requirements of section 905;
												(D)on the basis of new
				information before the Secretary with respect to such tobacco product,
				evaluated together with the evidence before the Secretary when the application
				was reviewed, that the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used
				for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or installation of such tobacco
				product do not conform with the requirements of section 906(e) and were not
				brought into conformity with such requirements within a reasonable time after
				receipt of written notice from the Secretary of nonconformity;
											(E)on the basis of new
				information before the Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before
				the Secretary when the application was reviewed, that the labeling of such
				tobacco product, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, is false or
				misleading in any particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time
				after receipt of written notice from the Secretary of such fact; or
											(F)on the basis of new
				information before the Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before
				the Secretary when such order was issued, that such tobacco product is not
				shown to conform in all respects to a tobacco product standard which is in
				effect under section 907, compliance with which was a condition to the issuance
				of an order relating to the application, and that there is a lack of adequate
				information to justify the deviation from such standard.
											(2)AppealThe
				holder of an application subject to an order issued under paragraph (1)
				withdrawing an order issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) may, by
				petition filed on or before the 30th day after the date upon which such holder
				receives notice of such withdrawal, obtain review thereof in accordance with
				section 912.
										(3)Temporary
				suspensionIf, after providing an opportunity for an informal
				hearing, the Secretary determines there is reasonable probability that the
				continuation of distribution of a tobacco product under an order would cause
				serious, adverse health consequences or death, that is greater than ordinarily
				caused by tobacco products on the market, the Secretary shall by order
				temporarily suspend the authority of the manufacturer to market the product. If
				the Secretary issues such an order, the Secretary shall proceed expeditiously
				under paragraph (1) to withdraw such application.
										(e)Service of
				OrderAn order issued by the Secretary under this section shall
				be served—
										(1)in person by any officer
				or employee of the department designated by the Secretary; or
										(2)by mailing the order by
				registered mail or certified mail addressed to the applicant at the applicant’s
				last known address in the records of the Secretary.
										(f)Records
										(1)Additional
				informationIn the case of any tobacco product for which an order
				issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) for an application filed under
				subsection (b) is in effect, the applicant shall establish and maintain such
				records, and make such reports to the Secretary, as the Secretary may by
				regulation, or by order with respect to such application, prescribe on the
				basis of a finding that such records and reports are necessary in order to
				enable the Secretary to determine, or facilitate a determination of, whether
				there is or may be grounds for withdrawing or temporarily suspending such
				order.
										(2)Access to
				recordsEach person required under this section to maintain
				records, and each person in charge of custody thereof, shall, upon request of
				an officer or employee designated by the Secretary, permit such officer or
				employee at all reasonable times to have access to and copy and verify such
				records.
										(g)Investigational Tobacco
				Product Exemption for Investigational UseThe Secretary may
				exempt tobacco products intended for investigational use from the provisions of
				this chapter under such conditions as the Secretary may by regulation
				prescribe.
									911.Modified risk tobacco
				products
									(a)In
				GeneralNo person may introduce or deliver for introduction into

									(b)DefinitionsIn
				this section:
										(1)Modified risk tobacco
				productThe term modified risk tobacco product means
				any tobacco product that is sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the
				risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco

										(2)Sold or
				distributed
											(A)In
				generalWith respect to a tobacco product, the term sold or
				distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease
				associated with commercially marketed tobacco products means a tobacco
				product—

				manufacturer of which has taken any action directed to consumers through the
				media or otherwise, other than by means of the tobacco product’s label,
				labeling, or advertising, after the date of enactment of the Family Smoking
				Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, respecting the product that would be
				reasonably expected to result in consumers believing that the tobacco product
				or its smoke may present a lower risk of disease or is less harmful than one or
				more commercially marketed tobacco products, or presents a reduced exposure to,
				or does not contain or is free of, a substance or substances.
												(B)LimitationNo
				tobacco product shall be considered to be sold or distributed for use to
				reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially

				into the domestic commerce of the United States any product that is not in
				conformance with paragraph (2)(A)(ii).
										(c)Tobacco dependence
				productsA product that is intended to be used for the treatment
				of tobacco dependence, including smoking cessation, is not a modified risk
				tobacco product under this section if it has been approved as a drug or device
				by the Food and Drug Administration and is subject to the requirements of
				chapter V.
									(d)FilingAny
				person may file with the Secretary an application for a modified risk tobacco
				product. Such application shall include—

										(6)data and information on
				how consumers actually use the tobacco product; and
										(7)such other information as
				the Secretary may require.
										(e)Public
				availabilityThe Secretary shall make the application described
				in subsection (d) publicly available (except matters in the application which
				are trade secrets or otherwise confidential, commercial information) and shall
				request comments by interested persons on the information contained in the
				application and on the label, labeling, and advertising accompanying such
				application.
									(f)Advisory
				committee
										(1)In
				generalThe Secretary shall refer to the Tobacco Products
				Scientific Advisory Committee any application submitted under this
				section.
										(2)RecommendationsNot
				later than 60 days after the date an application is referred to the Tobacco
				Products Scientific Advisory Committee under paragraph (1), the Advisory
				Committee shall report its recommendations on the application to the
				Secretary.
										(g)Marketing
										(1)Modified risk
				productsExcept as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary
				shall, with respect to an application submitted under this section, issue an
				order that a modified risk product may be commercially marketed only if the
				Secretary determines that the applicant has demonstrated that such product, as
				it is actually used by consumers, will—
											(A)significantly reduce harm
				and the risk of tobacco-related disease to individual tobacco users; and
											(B)benefit the health of the
				population as a whole taking into account both users of tobacco products and
				persons who do not currently use tobacco products.
											(2)Special rule for
				certain products
											(A)In
				generalThe Secretary may issue an order that a tobacco product
				may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce,
				pursuant to an application under this section, with respect to a tobacco
				product that may not be commercially marketed under paragraph (1) if the
				Secretary makes the findings required under this paragraph and determines that
				the applicant has demonstrated that—
												(i)such order would be
				appropriate to promote the public health;
												(ii)any aspect of the label,
				labeling, and advertising for such product that would cause the tobacco product
				to be a modified risk tobacco product under subsection (b) is limited to an
				explicit or implicit representation that such tobacco product or its smoke does
				not contain or is free of a substance or contains a reduced level of a
				substance, or presents a reduced exposure to a substance in tobacco
				smoke;
												(iii)scientific evidence is
				not available and, using the best available scientific methods, cannot be made
				available without conducting long-term epidemiological studies for an
				application to meet the standards set forth in paragraph (1); and
												(iv)the scientific evidence
				that is available without conducting long-term epidemiological studies
				demonstrates that a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity or
				mortality among individual tobacco users is reasonably likely in subsequent
				studies.
												(B)Additional findings
				requiredTo issue an order under subparagraph (A) the Secretary
				must also find that the applicant has demonstrated that—
												(i)the magnitude of the
				overall reductions in exposure to the substance or substances which are the
				subject of the application is substantial, such substance or substances are
				harmful, and the product as actually used exposes consumers to the specified
				reduced level of the substance or substances;
												(ii)the product as actually
				used by consumers will not expose them to higher levels of other harmful
				substances compared to the similar types of tobacco products then on the market
				unless such increases are minimal and the reasonably likely overall impact of
				use of the product remains a substantial and measurable reduction in overall
				morbidity and mortality among individual tobacco users;
												(iii)testing of actual
				consumer perception shows that, as the applicant proposes to label and market
				the product, consumers will not be misled into believing that the
				product—
													(I)is or has been
				demonstrated to be less harmful; or
													(II)presents or has been
				demonstrated to present less of a risk of disease than 1 or more other
				commercially marketed tobacco products; and
													(iv)issuance of an order
				with respect to the application is expected to benefit the health of the
				population as a whole taking into account both users of tobacco products and
				persons who do not currently use tobacco products.
												(C)Conditions of
				marketing
												(i)In
				generalApplications subject to an order under this paragraph
				shall be limited to a term of not more than 5 years, but may be renewed upon a
				finding by the Secretary that the requirements of this paragraph continue to be
				satisfied based on the filing of a new application.
												(ii)Agreements by
				applicantAn order under this paragraph shall be conditioned on
				the applicant’s agreement to conduct postmarket surveillance and studies and to
				submit to the Secretary the results of such surveillance and studies to
				determine the impact of the order on consumer perception, behavior, and health
				and to enable the Secretary to review the accuracy of the determinations upon
				which the order was based in accordance with a protocol approved by the
				Secretary.
												(iii)Annual
				submissionThe results of such postmarket surveillance and
				studies described in clause (ii) shall be submitted annually.
												(3)BasisThe
				determinations under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be based on—
											(A)the scientific evidence
				submitted by the applicant; and
											(B)scientific evidence and
				other information that is made available to the Secretary.
											(4)Benefit to health of
				individuals and of population as a wholeIn making the
				determinations under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall take into
				account—
											(A)the relative health risks
				to individuals of the tobacco product that is the subject of the
				application;
											(B)the increased or
				decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products who would
				otherwise stop using such products will switch to the tobacco product that is
				the subject of the application;
											(C)the increased or
				decreased likelihood that persons who do not use tobacco products will start
				using the tobacco product that is the subject of the application;
											(D)the risks and benefits to
				persons from the use of the tobacco product that is the subject of the
				application as compared to the use of products for smoking cessation approved
				under chapter V to treat nicotine dependence; and
											(E)comments, data, and
				information submitted by interested persons.
											(h)Additional Conditions
				for Marketing
										(1)Modified risk
				productsThe Secretary shall require for the marketing of a
				product under this section that any advertising or labeling concerning modified
				risk products enable the public to comprehend the information concerning
				modified risk and to understand the relative significance of such information
				in the context of total health and in relation to all of the diseases and
				health-related conditions associated with the use of tobacco products.
										(2)Comparative
				claims
											(A)In
				generalThe Secretary may require for the marketing of a product
				under this subsection that a claim comparing a tobacco product to 1 or more
				other commercially marketed tobacco products shall compare the tobacco product
				to a commercially marketed tobacco product that is representative of that type
				of tobacco product on the market (for example the average value of the top 3
				brands of an established regular tobacco product).
											(B)Quantitative
				comparisonsThe Secretary may also require, for purposes of
				subparagraph (A), that the percent (or fraction) of change and identity of the
				reference tobacco product and a quantitative comparison of the amount of the
				substance claimed to be reduced shall be stated in immediate proximity to the
				most prominent claim.
											(3)Label
				disclosure
											(A)In
				generalThe Secretary may require the disclosure on the label of
				other substances in the tobacco product, or substances that may be produced by
				the consumption of that tobacco product, that may affect a disease or
				health-related condition or may increase the risk of other diseases or
				health-related conditions associated with the use of tobacco products.
											(B)Conditions of
				useIf the conditions of use of the tobacco product may affect
				the risk of the product to human health, the Secretary may require the labeling
				of conditions of use.
											(4)TimeAn
				order issued under subsection (g)(1) shall be effective for a specified period
				of time.
										(5)AdvertisingThe
				Secretary may require, with respect to a product for which an applicant
				obtained an order under subsection (g)(1), that the product comply with
				requirements relating to advertising and promotion of the tobacco
				product.
										(i)Postmarket Surveillance
				and Studies
										(1)In
				generalThe Secretary shall require, with respect to a product
				for which an applicant obtained an order under subsection (g)(1), that the
				applicant conduct postmarket surveillance and studies for such a tobacco
				product to determine the impact of the order issuance on consumer perception,
				behavior, and health, to enable the Secretary to review the accuracy of the
				determinations upon which the order was based, and to provide information that
				the Secretary determines is otherwise necessary regarding the use or health
				risks involving the tobacco product. The results of postmarket surveillance and
				studies shall be submitted to the Secretary on an annual basis.
										(2)Surveillance
				protocolEach applicant required to conduct a surveillance of a
				tobacco product under paragraph (1) shall, within 30 days after receiving
				notice that the applicant is required to conduct such surveillance, submit, for
				the approval of the Secretary, a protocol for the required surveillance. The
				Secretary, within 60 days of the receipt of such protocol, shall determine if
				the principal investigator proposed to be used in the surveillance has
				sufficient qualifications and experience to conduct such surveillance and if
				such protocol will result in collection of the data or other information
				designated by the Secretary as necessary to protect the public health.
										(j)Withdrawal of
				AuthorizationThe Secretary, after an opportunity for an informal
				hearing, shall withdraw an order under subsection (g) if the Secretary
				determines that—
										(1)the applicant, based on
				new information, can no longer make the demonstrations required under
				subsection (g), or the Secretary can no longer make the determinations required
				under subsection (g);
										(2)the application failed to
				include material information or included any untrue statement of material
				fact;
										(3)any explicit or implicit
				representation that the product reduces risk or exposure is no longer valid,
				including if—
											(A)a tobacco product
				standard is established pursuant to section 907;
											(B)an action is taken that
				affects the risks presented by other commercially marketed tobacco products
				that were compared to the product that is the subject of the application;
				or
											(C)any postmarket
				surveillance or studies reveal that the order is no longer consistent with the
				protection of the public health;
											(4)the applicant failed to
				conduct or submit the postmarket surveillance and studies required under
				subsection (g)(2)(C)(ii) or subsection (i); or
										(5)the applicant failed to
				meet a condition imposed under subsection (h).

				evidenceNot later than 2 years after the date of enactment of
				the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the Secretary shall
				issue regulations or guidance (or any combination thereof) on the scientific
				evidence required for assessment and ongoing review of modified risk tobacco
				products. Such regulations or guidance shall—
											(A)to the extent that
				adequate scientific evidence exists, establish minimum standards for scientific
				studies needed prior to issuing an order under subsection (g) to show that a
				substantial reduction in morbidity or mortality among individual tobacco users
				occurs for products described in subsection (g)(1) or is reasonably likely for
				products described in subsection (g)(2);
											(B)include validated
				biomarkers, intermediate clinical endpoints, and other feasible outcome
				measures, as appropriate;
											(C)establish minimum

				new use of tobacco products, as appropriate;
											(D)establish minimum
				standards for required postmarket surveillance, including ongoing assessments
				of consumer perception;
											(E)require that data from
				the required studies and surveillance be made available to the Secretary prior

				harmful than one or more commercially marketed tobacco products, or presents a
				reduced exposure to, or does not contain or is free of, a substance or
				substances.

									(b)Contents of
				RulesThe regulations promulgated under subsection (a)—
										(1)shall require testing and
				reporting of tobacco product constituents, ingredients, and additives,
				including smoke constituents, by brand and subbrand that the Secretary
				determines should be tested to protect the public health; and
										(2)may require that tobacco
				product manufacturers, packagers, or importers make disclosures relating to the
				results of the testing of tar and nicotine through labels or advertising or
				other appropriate means, and make disclosures regarding the results of the
				testing of other constituents, including smoke constituents, ingredients, or
				additives, that the Secretary determines should be disclosed to the public to
				protect the public health and will not mislead consumers about the risk of
				tobacco-related disease.
										(c)AuthorityThe
				Secretary shall have the authority under this chapter to conduct or to require
				the testing, reporting, or disclosure of tobacco product constituents,
				including smoke constituents.
									(d)Small tobacco product
				manufacturers
										(1)First compliance
				dateThe initial regulations
				promulgated under subsection (a) shall not impose requirements on small tobacco
				product manufacturers before the later of—
											(A)the end of the 2-year
				period following the final promulgation of such regulations; and
											(B)the initial date set by the Secretary for
				compliance with such regulations by manufacturers that are not small tobacco
				product manufacturers.
											(2)Testing and reporting
				initial compliance period
											(A)4-year
				periodThe initial
				regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall give each small tobacco
				product manufacturer a 4-year period over which to conduct testing and
				reporting for all of its tobacco products. Subject to paragraph (1), the end of
				the first year of such 4-year period shall coincide with the initial date of
				compliance under this section set by the Secretary with respect to
				manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers or the end of
				the 2-year period following the final promulgation of such regulations, as
				described in paragraph (1)(A). A small tobacco product manufacturer shall be
				required—
												(i)to conduct such testing and reporting for
				25 percent of its tobacco products during each year of such 4-year period;
				and
												(ii)to conduct such testing and reporting for
				its largest-selling tobacco products (as determined by the Secretary) before
				its other tobacco products, or in such other order of priority as determined by
				the Secretary.
												(B)Case-by-case
				delayNotwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may, on a
				case-by-case basis, delay the date by which an individual small tobacco product
				manufacturer must conduct testing and reporting for its tobacco products under
				this section based upon a showing of undue hardship to such manufacturer.
				Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall not extend the
				deadline for a small tobacco product manufacturer to conduct testing and
				reporting for all of its tobacco products beyond a total of 5 years after the
				initial date of compliance under this section set by the Secretary with respect
				to manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers.
											(3)Subsequent and
				additional testing and reportingThe regulations promulgated under
				subsection (a) shall provide that, with respect to any subsequent or additional
				testing and reporting of tobacco products required under this section, such
				testing and reporting by a small tobacco product manufacturer shall be
				conducted in accordance with the timeframes described in paragraph (2)(A),
				except that, in the case of a new product, or if there has been a modification
				described in section 910(a)(1)(B) of any product of a small tobacco product
				manufacturer since the last testing and reporting required under this section,
				the Secretary shall require that any subsequent or additional testing and
				reporting be conducted in accordance with the same timeframe applicable to
				manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers.
										(4)Joint laboratory
				testing servicesThe
				Secretary shall allow any 2 or more small tobacco product manufacturers to join
				together to purchase laboratory testing services required by this section on a
				group basis in order to ensure that such manufacturers receive access to, and
				fair pricing of, such testing services.
										(e)Extensions for limited
				laboratory capacity
										(1)In
				generalThe regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall
				provide that a small tobacco product manufacturer shall not be considered to be
				in violation of this section before the deadline applicable under paragraphs
				(3) and (4), if—
											(A)the tobacco products of
				such manufacturer are in compliance with all other requirements of this
				chapter; and
											(B)the conditions described
				in paragraph (2) are met.
											(2)ConditionsNotwithstanding the requirements of this
				section, the Secretary may delay the date by which a small tobacco product
				manufacturer must be in compliance with the testing and reporting required by
				this section until such time as the testing is reported if, not later than 90
				days before the deadline for reporting in accordance with this section, a small
				tobacco product manufacturer provides evidence to the Secretary demonstrating
				that—
											(A)the manufacturer has submitted the required
				products for testing to a laboratory and has done so sufficiently in advance of
				the deadline to create a reasonable expectation of completion by the
				deadline;
											(B)the products currently
				are awaiting testing by the laboratory; and
											(C)neither that laboratory nor any other
				laboratory is able to complete testing by the deadline at customary,
				nonexpedited testing fees.
											(3)ExtensionThe
				Secretary, taking into account the laboratory testing capacity that is
				available to tobacco product manufacturers, shall review and verify the
				evidence submitted by a small tobacco product manufacturer in accordance with
				paragraph (2). If the Secretary finds that the conditions described in such
				paragraph are met, the Secretary shall notify the small tobacco product
				manufacturer that the manufacturer shall not be considered to be in violation
				of the testing and reporting requirements of this section until the testing is
				reported or until 1 year after the reporting deadline has passed, whichever
				occurs sooner. If, however, the Secretary has not made a finding before the
				reporting deadline, the manufacturer shall not be considered to be in violation
				of such requirements until the Secretary finds that the conditions described in
				paragraph (2) have not been met, or until 1 year after the reporting deadline,
				whichever occurs sooner.
										(4)Additional
				extensionIn addition to the
				time that may be provided under paragraph (3), the Secretary may provide
				further extensions of time, in increments of no more than 1 year, for required
				testing and reporting to occur if the Secretary determines, based on evidence
				properly and timely submitted by a small tobacco product manufacturer in
				accordance with paragraph (2), that a lack of available laboratory capacity
				prevents the manufacturer from completing the required testing during the
				period described in paragraph (3).
										(f)Rule of
				constructionNothing in
				subsection (d) or (e) shall be construed to authorize the extension of any
				deadline, or to otherwise affect any timeframe, under any provision of this Act
				or the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act other than this
				section.

				enforce any law, rule, regulation, or other measure with respect to tobacco
				products that is in addition to, or more stringent than, requirements
				established under this chapter, including a law, rule, regulation, or other
				measure relating to or prohibiting the sale, distribution, possession, exposure
				to, access to, advertising and promotion of, or use of tobacco products by
				individuals of any age, information reporting to the State, or measures
				relating to fire safety standards for tobacco products. No provision of this
				chapter shall limit or otherwise affect any State, tribal, or local taxation of
				tobacco products.
										(2)Preemption of certain
				state and local requirements
											(A)In
				generalNo State or political subdivision of a State may

				requirement which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement under
				the provisions of this chapter relating to tobacco product standards, premarket
				review, adulteration, misbranding, labeling, registration, good manufacturing
				standards, or modified risk tobacco products.
											(B)ExceptionSubparagraph
				(A) does not apply to requirements relating to the sale, distribution,
				possession, information reporting to the State, exposure to, access to, the

				age, or relating to fire safety standards for tobacco products. Information
				disclosed to a State under subparagraph (A) that is exempt from disclosure
				under section 552(b)(4) of title 5, United States Code, shall be treated as a
				trade secret and confidential information by the State.
											(b)Rule of Construction
				Regarding Product LiabilityNo provision of this chapter relating
				to a tobacco product shall be construed to modify or otherwise affect any
				action or the liability of any person under the product liability law of any

										(1)In
				generalAfter the expiration
				of the period for comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking published under
				subsection (c) respecting a tobacco product standard and after consideration of
				comments submitted under subsections (b) and (c) and any report from the
				Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, if the Secretary determines
				that the standard would be appropriate for the protection of the public health,
				the Secretary shall—
											(A)promulgate a regulation
				establishing a tobacco product standard and publish in the Federal Register
				findings on the matters referred to in subsection (c); or
											(B)publish a notice
				terminating the proceeding for the development of the standard together with
				the reasons for such termination.
											(2)Effective
				dateA regulation
				establishing a tobacco product standard shall set forth the date or dates upon
				which the standard shall take effect, but no such regulation may take effect
				before 1 year after the date of its publication unless the Secretary determines
				that an earlier effective date is necessary for the protection of the public
				health. Such date or dates shall be established so as to minimize, consistent
				with the public health, economic loss to, and disruption or dislocation of,
				domestic and international trade. In establishing such effective date or dates,
				the Secretary shall consider information submitted in connection with a
				proposed product standard by interested parties, including manufacturers and
				tobacco growers, regarding the technical achievability of compliance with the
				standard, and including information concerning the existence of patents that
				make it impossible to comply in the timeframe envisioned in the proposed
				standard. If the Secretary determines, based on the Secretary’s evaluation of
				submitted comments, that a product standard can be met only by manufacturers
				requiring substantial changes to the methods of farming the domestically grown
				tobacco used by the manufacturer, the effective date of that product standard
				shall be not less than 2 years after the date of publication of the final
				regulation establishing the standard.
										(3)Limitation on power
				granted to the Food and Drug AdministrationBecause of the
				importance of a decision of the Secretary to issue a regulation—
											(A)banning all cigarettes,
				all smokeless tobacco products, all little cigars, all cigars other than little
				cigars, all pipe tobacco, or all roll-your-own tobacco products; or
											(B)requiring the reduction
				of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero,
											the
				Secretary is prohibited from taking such actions under this Act.(4)Amendment;
				revocation
											(A)AuthorityThe
				Secretary, upon the Secretary’s own initiative or upon petition of an
				interested person, may by a regulation, promulgated in accordance with the
				requirements of subsection (c) and paragraph (2), amend or revoke a tobacco
				product standard.
											(B)Effective
				dateThe Secretary may declare a proposed amendment of a tobacco
				product standard to be effective on and after its publication in the Federal
				Register and until the effective date of any final action taken on such
				amendment if the Secretary determines that making it so effective is in the
				public interest.
											(5)Referral to advisory
				committee
											(A)In
				generalThe Secretary may refer a proposed regulation for the
				establishment, amendment, or revocation of a tobacco product standard to the
				Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee for a report and recommendation
				with respect to any matter involved in the proposed regulation which requires
				the exercise of scientific judgment.
											(B)Initiation of
				referralThe Secretary may make a referral under this
				paragraph—
												(i)on the Secretary’s own
				initiative; or
												(ii)upon the request of an
				interested person that—
													(I)demonstrates good cause
				for the referral; and
													(II)is made before the
				expiration of the period for submission of comments on the proposed
				regulation.
													(C)Provision of
				dataIf a proposed regulation is referred under this paragraph to
				the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, the Secretary shall provide
				the Advisory Committee with the data and information on which such proposed
				regulation is based.
											(D)Report and
				recommendationThe Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee
				shall, within 60 days after the referral of a proposed regulation under this
				paragraph and after independent study of the data and information furnished to

				manufacturer must be in compliance with the testing and reporting required by
				this section until such time as the testing is reported if, not later than 90
				days before the deadline for reporting in accordance with this section, a small

											(B)the products currently

			 read as follows:
							
								(d)(1)Except as provided in
				subparagraph (2), no manufacturer, distributor, or retailer may distribute or
				cause to be distributed any free samples of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, or
				other tobacco products (as such term is defined in section 201 of the Federal
				Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act).
									(2)(A)Subparagraph (1) does not
				prohibit a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer from distributing or causing
				to be distributed free samples of smokeless tobacco in a qualified adult-only
				facility.
										(B)This subparagraph does
				not affect the authority of a State or local government to prohibit or
				otherwise restrict the distribution of free samples of smokeless
				tobacco.
										(C)For purposes of this paragraph, the term
				qualified adult-only facility means a facility or restricted area
				that—
											(i)requires each person
				present to provide to a law enforcement officer (whether on or off duty) or to
				a security guard licensed by a governmental entity government-issued
				identification showing a photograph and at least the minimum age established by
				applicable law for the purchase of smokeless tobacco;
											(ii)does not sell, serve, or
				distribute alcohol;
											(iii)is not located adjacent to or immediately
				across from (in any direction) a space that is used primarily for
				youth-oriented marketing, promotional, or other activities;
											(iv)is a temporary structure constructed,
				designated, and operated as a distinct enclosed area for the purpose of
				distributing free samples of smokeless tobacco in accordance with this
				subparagraph; and
											(v)is enclosed by a barrier
				that—
												(I)is constructed of, or
				covered with, an opaque material (except for entrances and exits);
												(II)extends from no more than 12 inches above
				the ground or floor (which area at the bottom of the barrier must be covered
				with material that restricts visibility but may allow airflow) to at least 8
				feet above the ground or floor (or to the ceiling); and
												(III)prevents persons
				outside the qualified adult-only facility from seeing into the qualified
				adult-only facility, unless they make unreasonable efforts to do so; and
												(vi)does not display on its
				exterior—
												(I)any tobacco product
				advertising;
												(II)a brand name other than
				in conjunction with words for an area or enclosure to identify an adult-only
				facility; or
												(III)any combination of
				words that would imply to a reasonable observer that the manufacturer,
				distributor, or retailer has a sponsorship that would violate section
				897.34(c).
												(D)Distribution of samples of smokeless
				tobacco under this subparagraph permitted to be taken out of the qualified
				adult-only facility shall be limited to 1 package per adult consumer containing
				no more than 0.53 ounces (15 grams) of smokeless tobacco. If such package of
				smokeless tobacco contains individual portions of smokeless tobacco, the
				individual portions of smokeless tobacco shall not exceed 8 individual portions
				and the collective weight of such individual portions shall not exceed 0.53
				ounces (15 grams). Any manufacturer, distributor, or retailer who distributes
				or causes to be distributed free samples also shall take reasonable steps to
				ensure that the above amounts are limited to one such package per adult
				consumer per day.
										(3)Notwithstanding
				subparagraph (2), no manufacturer, distributor, or retailer may distribute or
				cause to be distributed any free samples of smokeless tobacco—
										(A)to a sports team or
				entertainment group; or
										(B)at any football, basketball, baseball,
				soccer, or hockey event or any other sporting or entertainment event determined
				by the Secretary to be covered by this subparagraph.
										(4)The Secretary shall
				implement a program to ensure compliance with this paragraph and submit a
				report to the Congress on such compliance not later than 18 months after the
				date of enactment of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control
				Act.
									(5)Nothing in this paragraph shall be
				construed to authorize any person to distribute or cause to be distributed any
				sample of a tobacco product to any individual who has not attained the minimum
				age established by applicable law for the purchase of such
				product.

				predominant language of the publication; and
									(B)in the case of any other
				advertisement that is not in English, the statements shall appear in the same
				language as that principally used in the advertisement.
									(3)MatchbooksNotwithstanding
				paragraph (2), for matchbooks (defined as containing not more than 20 matches)
				customarily given away with the purchase of tobacco products, each label
				statement required by subsection (a) may be printed on the inside cover of the
				matchbook.
								(4)Adjustment by
				SecretaryThe Secretary may, through a rulemaking under section
				553 of title 5, United States Code, adjust the format and type sizes for the
				label statements required by this section; the text, format, and type sizes of
				any required tar, nicotine yield, or other constituent (including smoke
				constituent) disclosures; or the text, format, and type sizes for any other
				disclosures required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The text

				retailer and approved by the Secretary.
								(2)RotationThe
				label statements specified in subsection (a)(1) shall be rotated quarterly in
				alternating sequence in advertisements for each brand of cigarettes in
				accordance with a plan submitted by the tobacco product manufacturer, importer,
				distributor, or retailer to, and approved by, the Secretary.
								(3)ReviewThe
				Secretary shall review each plan submitted under paragraph (2) and approve it
				if the plan—
									(A)will provide for the
				equal distribution and display on packaging and the rotation required in
				advertising under this subsection; and
									(B)assures that all of the
				labels required under this section will be displayed by the tobacco product
				manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer at the same time.
									(4)Applicability to
				retailersThis subsection and
				subsection (b) apply to a retailer only if that retailer is responsible for or
				directs the label statements required under this section except that this
				paragraph shall not relieve a retailer of liability if the retailer displays,
				in a location open to the public, an advertisement that does not contain a
				warning label or has been altered by the retailer in a way that is material to
				the requirements of this subsection and subsection
				(b).
