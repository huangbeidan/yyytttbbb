				resources project, or an acceptable separable element thereof, by the Secretary
				of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, or by a non-Federal
				interest where such interest will be reimbursed for such construction under any
				provision of law, shall not be commenced until each non-Federal interest has
				entered into a written partnership agreement with the Secretary (or, where
				appropriate, the district engineer for the district in which the project will
				be carried out) under which each party agrees to carry out its responsibilities
				and requirements for implementation or construction of the project or the
				appropriate element of the project, as the case may be; except that no such
				agreement shall be required if the Secretary determines that the administrative
				costs associated with negotiating, executing, or administering the agreement

				damagesA partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) may
				include a provision for liquidated damages in the event of a failure of one or

				paragraph (1) and entered into by a State, or a body politic of the State which
				derives its powers from the State constitution, or a governmental entity
				created by the State legislature, the agreement may reflect that it does not
				obligate future appropriations for such performance and payment when obligating

				interest is to receive credit under subparagraph (A)(ii) for the cost of work
				carried out by the non-Federal interest and such work has not been carried out
				as of the date of enactment of this subparagraph, the Secretary and the
				non-Federal interest shall enter into an agreement under which the non-Federal
				interest shall carry out such work, and only work carried out following the
				execution of the agreement shall be eligible for credit.

				authorized under this paragraph for a project—
										(i)shall not exceed
				the non-Federal share of the cost of the project;

				rights-of-way, or areas for disposal of dredged material for the
				project;
										(iii)shall not alter
				any requirement that a non-Federal interest pay a portion of the costs of
				construction of the project under sections 101 and 103 of the Water Resources
				Development Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2211; 33 U.S.C. 2213); and
										(iv)shall not exceed
				the actual and reasonable costs of the materials, services, or other things
				provided by the non-Federal interest, as determined by the Secretary.
										(E)Applicability
										(i)In
				generalThis paragraph shall apply to water resources projects
				authorized after November 16, 1986, including projects initiated after November
				16, 1986, without specific authorization in law.
										(ii)LimitationIn
				any case in which a specific provision of law provides for a non-Federal
				interest to receive credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of a study
				for, or construction or operation and maintenance of, a water resources
				project, the specific provision of law shall apply instead of this
				paragraph.
										.

			 interestSection 221(b) of such Act is amended to read as
			 follows:
					
						(b)Definition of
				non-federal interestThe term non-Federal interest
				means a legally constituted public body (including a federally recognized

			2036.Project
			 planning
				(a)Determination of
			 Certain National Benefits
					(1)Sense of
			 congressIt is the sense of Congress that, consistent with the
			 Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land
			 Resources Implementation Studies (1983), the Secretary may select a water
			 resources project alternative that does not maximize net national economic
			 development benefits or net national ecosystem restoration benefits if there is
			 an overriding reason based on other Federal, State, local, or international
			 concerns.
					(2)Flood damage
			 reduction, navigation, and hurricane storm damage reduction
			 projectsWith respect to a water resources project the primary
			 purpose of which is flood damage reduction, navigation, or hurricane and storm
			 damage reduction, an overriding reason for selecting a plan other than the plan
			 that maximizes net national economic development benefits may be if the
			 Secretary determines, and the non-Federal interest concurs, that an alternative
			 plan is feasible and achieves the project purposes while providing greater
			 ecosystem restoration benefits.
					(3)Ecosystem
			 restoration projectsWith respect to a water resources project
			 the primary purpose of which is ecosystem restoration, an overriding reason for
			 selecting a plan other than the plan that maximizes net national ecosystem
			 restoration benefits may be if the Secretary determines, and the non-Federal
			 interest concurs, that an alternative plan is feasible and achieves the project
			 purposes while providing greater economic development benefits.
					(b)Identifying
			 Additional Benefits and Projects
					(1)Primarily
			 economic benefitsIn conducting a study of the feasibility of a
			 project where the primary benefits are expected to be economic, the Secretary
			 may identify ecosystem restoration benefits that may be achieved in the study
			 area and, after obtaining the participation of a non-Federal interest, may
			 study and recommend construction of additional measures, a separate project, or
			 separable project element to achieve those benefits.
					(2)Primarily
			 ecosystem restoration benefitsIn conducting a study of the
			 feasibility of a project where the primary benefits are expected to be
			 associated with ecosystem restoration, the Secretary may identify economic
			 benefits that may be achieved in the study area and, after obtaining the
			 participation of a non-Federal interest, may study and recommend construction
			 of additional measures, a separate project, or separable project element to
			 achieve those benefits.
					(3)Rules applicable
			 to certain measures, projects, and elementsAny additional
			 measures, separate project, or separable element identified under paragraph (1)
			 or (2) and recommended for construction shall not be considered integral to the
			 underlying project and, if authorized, shall be subject to a separate
			 partnership agreement, unless a non-Federal interest agrees to share in the
			 cost of the additional measures, project, or separable element.
					(c)Calculation of
			 Benefits and Costs for Flood Damage Reduction ProjectsA
			 feasibility study for a project for flood damage reduction shall include, as
			 part of the calculation of benefits and costs—
					(1)a
			 calculation of the residual risk of flooding following completion of the
			 proposed project;
					(2)a
			 calculation of any upstream or downstream impacts of the proposed project;
			 and
					(3)calculations to
			 ensure that the benefits and costs associated with structural and nonstructural
			 alternatives are evaluated in an equitable manner.
					2037.Independent
			 peer review

			2036.Project
			 planning
				(a)Determination of
			 Certain National Benefits
					(1)Sense of
			 congressIt is the sense of Congress that, consistent with the
			 Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land
			 Resources Implementation Studies (1983), the Secretary may select a water
			 resources project alternative that does not maximize net national economic
			 development benefits or net national ecosystem restoration benefits if there is
			 an overriding reason based on other Federal, State, local, or international
			 concerns.
					(2)Flood damage reduction,
			 navigation, and hurricane storm damage reduction projectsWith
			 respect to a water resources project the primary purpose of which is flood
			 damage reduction, navigation, or hurricane and storm damage reduction, an
			 overriding reason for selecting a plan other than the plan that maximizes net
			 national economic development benefits may be if the Secretary determines, and
			 the non-Federal interest concurs, that an alternative plan is feasible and
			 achieves the project purposes while providing greater ecosystem restoration
			 benefits.
					(3)Ecosystem restoration
			 projectsWith respect to a water resources project the primary
			 purpose of which is ecosystem restoration, an overriding reason for selecting a
			 plan other than the plan that maximizes net national ecosystem restoration
			 benefits may be if the Secretary determines, and the non-Federal interest
			 concurs, that an alternative plan is feasible and achieves the project purposes
			 while providing greater economic development benefits.
					(b)Identifying Additional
			 Benefits and Projects
					(1)Primarily economic
			 benefitsIn conducting a study of the feasibility of a project
			 where the primary benefits are expected to be economic, the Secretary may
			 identify ecosystem restoration benefits that may be achieved in the study area
			 and, after obtaining the participation of a non-Federal interest, may study and
			 recommend construction of additional measures, a separate project, or separable
			 project element to achieve those benefits.
					(2)Primarily ecosystem
			 restoration benefitsIn conducting a study of the feasibility of
			 a project where the primary benefits are expected to be associated with
			 ecosystem restoration, the Secretary may identify economic benefits that may be
			 achieved in the study area and, after obtaining the participation of a
			 non-Federal interest, may study and recommend construction of additional
			 measures, a separate project, or separable project element to achieve those
			 benefits.
