				(1)self-contained

				(3)improved technology for
			 assisting mine rescue teams, including devices to enhance vision during rescue
			 or recovery operations;
				(4)improved technology, and
			 improved protocols for the use of existing technologies, to enable conditions
			 underground to be assessed promptly and continuously in emergencies, so as to
			 facilitate the determination by appropriate officials of the instructions to
			 provide both to miners trapped underground and to mine rescue teams and others
			 engaged in rescue efforts;
				(5)improvements to
			 underground mine ventilation controls separating mine entries to be more
			 resistant to mine fires and explosions, particularly in those entries used for
			 miner escapeways;
				(6)mine-wide monitoring
			 systems and strategies that can monitor mine gases, oxygen, air flows, and air
			 quantities at strategic locations throughout the mine that would be functional
			 during normal mining operations and following mine fires, explosions, roof

			 transfer data to the mine surface and the installation of tubing to draw mine

				(7)protective strategies for
			 the placement of equipment, cables, and devices that are to be utilized during

			 at the end the following:
				
					(f)Notwithstanding the other requirements of
				this section, not later than 30 days of the enactment of the S–MINER Act, the
				National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health shall forward to the
				Secretary its Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) for chemical and other hazards
				to which miners may be exposed, along with the research data and other
				necessary information. Within 30 days of receipt of this information, the
				Secretary shall to adopt such recommended exposure limits as the Permissible
				Exposure Limits (PELs) for application in the mining industry. The National
				Institute of Occupational Safety and Health shall annually submit to the
				Secretary any additional or revised recommended exposure limits for all
				chemicals and other hazards to which miners may be exposed, and the Secretary
				shall be obligated to adopt such exposure limits as PELs for application in the
				mining industry within 30 days of receipt of such information. Upon petition
				from miners or mine operators providing credible evidence that feasibility may
				be an issue for the industry as a whole, the Secretary may review the
				feasibility of any PEL established pursuant to this paragraph before placing it
				into effect and, following public notice and comment, make necessary
				adjustments thereto, provided that the adjusted standard is as protective as is
				feasible, and that the PEL shall go into effect as required by the other
				provisions of this paragraph if such action is not completed within one year.
				Moreover, upon petition from miners or mine operators providing credible
				evidence that a REL issued by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
				Health lacks the specificity required to serve as a PEL pursuant to this Act,
				the Secretary may defer implementation of the requirements of this paragraph
				and shall promptly request National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health
				to recommend a sufficiently detailed REL, at which time the provisions of this
				paragraph shall be implemented. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the
				ability of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health to make
				such recommendations more frequently than 1 time per year, nor limit the
				Secretary from establishing requirements for chemical and other substances or
				health hazards in the mining industry that are more comprehensive and
				protective than those established pursuant to this subsection and in accordance
				with the other requirements of this
				section.

			(b)AsbestosSection
			 101 (30 U.S.C. 811) is further amended by adding at the end the

					(g)The health standard for
				asbestos established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that
				is set forth in section 1910.1001 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, or
				any subsequent revision of that regulation, shall be adopted by the Secretary
				for application in the mining industry not later than 30 days of the enactment
				of the S–MINER Act. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Secretary from
				adopting regulations to address asbestos hazards to miners not covered by the
				regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health
				Administration.
					.
			(c)Hazard
			 communicationSection 101 (30 U.S.C. 811) is further amended by
			 adding at the end the following:
				
					(h)Unless and until there is
				additional rulemaking pursuant to the requirements of this section, the
				Secretary shall apply the provisions of the interim final rule of October 3,
