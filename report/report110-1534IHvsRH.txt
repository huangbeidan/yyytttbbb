				identified foreign facility if the Administrator finds that—

				for the specified use are not available in the country where the facility is

								(ii)there is no other source of elemental
				mercury available from domestic supplies (not including new mercury mines) in
				the country where the elemental mercury will be used;
								(iii)the country where the
				elemental mercury will be used certifies its support for the exemption;
								(iv)the export will be conducted in such a

				facility as described in the petition, and not otherwise diverted for other
				uses for any reason;
								(v)the elemental mercury will be used in a
				manner that will protect human health and the environment, taking into account
				local, regional, and global human health and environmental impacts;
								(vi)the elemental mercury will be handled and

				into account local, regional, and global human health and environmental
