						(a)In
				General
							(1)Mandatory
				standardNotwithstanding any other provision of law, within 90
				days after the date of enactment of the Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
				Prevention Act, the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall publish in the
				Federal Register as a mandatory consumer product safety standard the American
				National Standard for Single and Multiple Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms
				(American National Standard ANSI/UL 2034â€“2005). The standard shall take effect
				180 days after it is published.
							(2)Compliance with
				standardAfter the standard takes effect, it shall be unlawful
				for any manufacturer or distributor to import into or distribute in commerce in
				the United States any new assembled or unassembled residential carbon monoxide
				detector unless it complies with the standard.
							(3)ViolationThe
				failure to comply with paragraph (2) shall be deemed to be a failure to comply
				with a consumer product safety standard under this Act and subject to all of
				the penalties and remedies available under this Act.
							(4)Other types of
				carbon monoxide detectorsParagraph (2) does not apply to any
				carbon monoxide detector not covered by the standard as provided in section 1.4
				of the standard.
							(b)LabelingBeginning
				1 year after the date of enactment of the Residential Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
				Prevention Act, a manufacturer selling or offering for sale in the United
				States a residential carbon monoxide detector manufactured more than 1 year
				after the date of enactment of that Act, shall clearly identify on any
				container of the detector and on the detector its conformance with the
				requirements of the consumer product safety standard promulgated under
				subsection (a).
						(c)Modification of
				Standard
							(1)ANSI
				revisionsIf the American National Standard ANSI/UL 2034â€“2008 is
				revised through the applicable consensus standards development process after
				the date on which the product safety standard for residential carbon monoxide
				detectors is published in the Federal Register, the American National Standards
				Institute shall notify the Commission of the revision.
							(2)Commission
				actionWithin 120 days after it receives notice of such a
				revision by the American National Standards Institute, the Commission shall
				issue a notice of proposed rulemaking in accordance with section 553 of title
				5, United States Code, to amend the product safety standard for residential
				carbon monoxide detectors to include any such revision that the Commission
				determines is reasonably related to the performance of such detectors, and
				notify the Institute of any revision it has determined not to be so related.
				The Commission shall promulgate an amendment to the standard for such detectors
				within 180 days after the date on which the notice of proposed rulemaking for
				the amendment is published in the Federal Register.
							(3)Additional
				safety requirementsNotwithstanding any other provision of this
				Act, the Commission may, pursuant to sections 7 and 9 of this Act, amend the
				product safety standard for residential carbon monoxide detectors to include
				any additional provision that the Commission determines is reasonably necessary
				to ensure their safe and effective operation.
							(4)Certain
				provisions not applicableSections 7 and 9 of this Act shall not
				apply to promulgation of any amendment of the product safety standard under
				paragraph (2). Judicial review of any amendment of the standard under paragraph
				(2) shall be in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5, United States
