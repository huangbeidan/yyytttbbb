			 as defined in the Uniform Property ampSamp; Casualty Product Coding Matrix
			 published and maintained by the National Association of Insurance
			 Commissioners;
					(4)has a governing
			 body, a majority of whose members are public officials;
					(5)provides
			 reinsurance or retrocessional coverage to underlying primary insurers or
			 reinsurers for losses in excess of such amount that the Secretary has
			 determined represents a catastrophic event in that particular State;
					(6)is authorized by a
			 State that has in effect such laws, regulations, or other requirements, as the
			 Secretary shall by regulation provide, that—
						(A)ensure, to the
			 extent that reinsurance coverage made available under the qualified reinsurance
			 program results in any cost savings in providing insurance coverage for risks
			 in such State, such cost savings are reflected in premium rates charged to
			 consumers for such coverage;
						(B)require that an
			 appropriate public body within the State shall have adopted adequate mitigation
			 measures (with effective enforcement provisions) which the Secretary finds are
			 consistent with the criteria for construction described in the International
			 Code Council building codes;
						(C)require State
			 authorized insurance entities within that State to establish an insurance rate
			 structure that takes into account measures to mitigate insurance losses;
						(D)require State authorized insurance and
			 reinsurance entities within that State to establish rates at a level that
			 annually produces expected premiums that shall be sufficient to pay the
			 reasonably anticipated cost of all claims, loss adjustment expenses, and all

			 certified by the Secretary, for such year, in accordance with an annual
			 certification process established by the Secretary for such purpose, as being
			 in compliance with the requirements under paragraphs (1) through (10).
					(b)Risk-based
			 capital requirements
					(1)In
			 generalExcept for programs
			 deemed to be qualified reinsurance programs pursuant to subsection (c), each
			 qualified reinsurance program shall maintain risk-based capital in accordance
			 with requirements established by the Secretary, in consultation with the
			 National Association of Insurance Commissioners and consistent with the
			 Risk-Based Capital Model Act of the National Association of Insurance
			 Commissioners, and take into consideration asset risk, credit risk,
			 underwriting risk, and such other relevant risk as determined by the
			 Secretary.
					(2)Treatment of
			 access to liquidity loans
						(A)In
			 generalTo the extent that a
			 qualified reinsurance program is deficient in complying with any aspect of the
			 risk-based capital requirements established pursuant to this subsection, the
			 Secretary shall recognize and give credit for the ability of such qualified
			 reinsurance program to access capital through the liquidity loan program
			 established under section 202(d).
						(B)Annual
			 diminutionThe extent of credit recognized and given for a
			 qualified reinsurance program pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall diminish
			 annually in a proportion equal to the earned premium for the program for the
			 prior calendar year.
						(C)Reset upon
			 occurrence of catastropheTo
			 the extent that a qualified reinsurance program is obligated to pay losses as a
			 result of the occurrence of a catastrophe, the Secretary shall increase the
			 credit recognized and given for the program pursuant to subparagraph (A) by an
			 amount equal to the losses paid by the program as a result of the
			 catastrophe.
						(D)Resumption after
			 catastropheAfter a reset
			 occurs pursuant to subparagraph (C) for a qualified reinsurance program, the
			 diminution described in subparagraph (B) shall resume and continue until the
			 program has accumulated capital sufficient to satisfy the risk-based capital
			 requirement determined by the Secretary to be appropriate given the ceiling
			 coverage level of that particular qualified reinsurance program.
						(3)ReportFor
			 each calendar year, each qualified reinsurance program shall prepare and submit
			 to the Secretary a report identifying its risk based capital, at such time
			 after the conclusion of such year, and containing such information and in such
			 form, as the Secretary shall require.
					(c)Transitional
			 MechanismsFor the five-year
			 period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, in the case of a
			 State that does not have a qualified reinsurance program for the State, a State
			 residual insurance market entity, or State-sponsored provider of natural
			 catastrophe insurance, for such State shall be considered to be a qualified
			 reinsurance program, but only if such State residual insurance market entity,
			 or State-sponsored provider of natural catastrophe insurance, was in existence
			 before such date of enactment.
				(d)PrecertificationThe
			 Secretary shall establish procedures and standards for State and regional
			 reinsurance programs and the State residual insurance market entities described
			 in section (b) to apply to the Secretary at any time for certification (and
			 recertification) as qualified reinsurance programs.
				(e)Reinsurance To
			 cover exposureThis section may not be construed to limit or
			 prevent any insurer from obtaining reinsurance coverage for insured losses
			 retained by insurers pursuant to this section, nor shall the obtaining of such
			 coverage affect the calculation of the amount of any loan under this
			 title.
				402.Study and
			 conditional coverage of commercial residential lines of insurance
				(a)StudyThe Secretary shall study, on an expedited
			 basis, the need for and impact of expanding the programs established by this
			 Act to apply to insured losses of qualified reinsurance programs for losses
			 arising from all commercial insurance policies which provide coverage for
			 properties that are composed predominantly of residential rental units. The
			 Secretary shall consider the catastrophic insurance and reinsurance market for
			 commercial residential properties, and specifically the availability of
			 adequate private insurance coverage when an insured event occurs, the impact
			 any such capacity restrictions has on housing affordability for renters, and
			 the likelihood that such an expansion of the program would increase insurance
			 capacity for this market segment.
				(b)Conditional
			 CoverageTo the extent that
			 the Secretary determines that there is such a need to expand such programs and
			 such expansion will be effective in increasing insurance capacity for the
			 commercial residential insurance market, the Secretary shall, in consultation
			 with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners—
					(1)apply the provisions of this Act, as
			 appropriate, to insured losses of a qualified reinsurance program for losses
			 arising from commercial insurance policies which provide coverage for
			 properties that are composed predominantly of residential rental units, as
			 described in paragraph (a); and
					(2)provide such
			 restrictions, limitations, or conditions with respect to the programs under
			 this Act that the Secretary deems appropriate, based on the study under
			 subsection (a).
					403.DefinitionsFor purposes of this Act, the following
			 definitions shall apply:
				(1)Ceiling coverage
			 levelThe term ceiling coverage level means, with
			 respect to a qualified reinsurance program, the maximum liability that could be
			 incurred at any time by the qualified reinsurance program.
				(2)Insured
			 lossThe term insured loss means any loss insured
			 by a qualified reinsurance program.
				(3)Price
			 gougingThe term price
			 gouging means the providing of any consumer good or service by a
			 supplier related to repair or restoration of property damaged from a
			 catastrophe for a price that the supplier knows or has reason to know is
			 greater, by at least the percentage set forth in a State law or regulation
			 prohibiting such act (not withstanding any real cost increase due to any
			 attendant business risk and other reasonable expenses that result from the
			 major catastrophe involved), than the price charged by the supplier for such
			 consumer good or service immediately before the disaster.
				(4)Qualified
			 reinsurance programThe term qualified reinsurance
			 program means a State or regional program that meets the requirements
			 under section 401.
				(5)SecretaryThe
			 term Secretary means the Secretary of the Treasury.
