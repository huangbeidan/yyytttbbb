  In this section, the term loss to a small business means documented financial losses associated with commercial activity of a small business that can be attributed to the turbidity levels in the McKenzie River being higher than those anticipated in the original planning documents and public announcements existing before the initiation of the drawdown in 2002. Commercial losses include decline in sales, loss of revenue (including loss of revenue from canceled or delayed reservations at lodging establishments), and any other financial losses that can be shown to be associated with the elevated turbidity levels in the McKenzie River in 2002.
