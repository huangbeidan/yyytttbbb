				(a)RulemakingNot later than 18 months following the date
			 of enactment of this Act the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding
			 under section 30111 of title 49, United States Code, to promulgate a motor
			 vehicle safety standard to establish performance requirements for an alert
			 sound that allows blind and other pedestrians to reasonably detect a nearby
			 electric or hybrid vehicle operating below the cross-over speed, if any. Such
			 standard—
					(1)shall require new
			 electric or hybrid vehicles to provide an alert sound conforming to the
			 requirements of the motor vehicle safety standard established under this
			 subsection;
					(2)shall not require either driver or
			 pedestrian activation of the alert sound;
					(3)shall allow the pedestrian to reasonably
			 detect a nearby electric or hybrid vehicle in critical operating scenarios,
			 including but not limited to constant speed, accelerating, and
			 decelerating;
					(4)shall allow manufacturers
			 to provide each vehicle with 1 or more alert sounds that comply with the motor
			 vehicle safety standard at the time of manufacture; and
					(5)shall require manufacturers to provide,
			 within reasonable manufacturing tolerances, the same alert sound or set of
			 alert sounds for all vehicles of the same make and model and shall prohibit
			 manufacturers from providing any mechanism for anyone other than the
			 manufacturer or the dealer to disable, alter, replace, or modify the alert
			 sound or set of alert sounds, except that the manufacturer or dealer may alter,
			 replace, or modify the alert sound or set of alert sounds in order to remedy a
			 defect or non-compliance with the motor vehicle safety standard.
					(b)ConsiderationWhen
			 conducting the required rulemaking, the Secretary shall—
					(1)determine the minimum level of an alert
			 sound emitted from a motor vehicle that is necessary to provide blind and other
			 pedestrians with the information needed to reasonably detect a nearby electric
			 or hybrid vehicle operating at or below the cross-over speed, if any;
					(2)determine the performance
			 requirements for an alert sound that is recognizable to a pedestrian as a motor
			 vehicle in operation; and
					(3)consider the overall
			 noise impact to streets and communities.
					(c)Phase-in
			 requiredThe motor vehicle safety standard prescribed pursuant to
			 subsection (a) shall establish a phase-in period for compliance, as determined
			 by the Secretary, and shall require full compliance with the required motor
			 vehicle safety standard for motor vehicles manufactured on or after September 1
			 of the calendar year that begins 3 years after the date on which the final rule
			 is issued.
				(d)ConsultationWhen
			 conducting the required study and rulemaking, the Secretary shall consult
			 with—
					(1)the Environmental
			 Protection Agency to assure that the motor vehicle safety standard is
			 consistent with existing noise requirements overseen by the Agency;
					(2)consumer groups
			 representing individuals who are blind;
					(3)automobile manufacturers
			 and professional organizations representing them; and
					(4)technical standardization
			 organizations responsible for measurement methods such as the Society of
			 Automotive Engineers, the International Organization for Standardization, and
			 the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, World Forum for
			 Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations.
					(e)DeadlineThe Secretary shall issue a final rule
			 under subsection (a) not later than 36 months after the date of enactment of
			 this Act.
				(f)Study and
			 reportNot later than 4 years after the date of enactment of this
			 Act, the Secretary shall complete a study and report to Congress as to whether
			 there exists a safety need to apply the motor vehicle safety standard required
			 by subsection (a) to conventional motor vehicles. In the event that the
			 Secretary determines there exists a safety need, the Secretary shall initiate
			 rulemaking under section 30111 of title 49, United States Code to extend the
			 standard to conventional motor vehicles.
				(g)DefinitionsFor
			 purposes of the motor vehicle safety standard required under this
			 section—
					(1)the term alert sound means a
			 vehicle-emitted sound that enables pedestrians to discern vehicle presence,
			 direction, location, and operation;
					(2)the term
			 cross-over speed means the speed at which tire noise, wind
			 resistance, or other factors eliminate the need for a separate alert sound, as
			 determined by the Secretary;
					(3)the term conventional motor
			 vehicle means a motor vehicle powered by a gasoline, diesel, or
			 alternative fueled internal combustion engine as its sole means of
			 propulsion;
					(4)the term electric
			 vehicle means a motor vehicle with an electric motor as its sole means
			 of propulsion; and
					(5)the term hybrid
			 vehicle means a motor vehicle which has more than one means of
			 propulsion.
