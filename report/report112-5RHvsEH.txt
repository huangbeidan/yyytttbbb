			 claim that such product caused the claimant’s harm where—
						(i)(I)such medical product was

							(ii)such medical product is
			 generally recognized among qualified experts as safe and effective pursuant to

			 and Drug Administration regulations, including without limitation those related
			 to packaging and labeling, unless the Food and Drug Administration has
			 determined that such medical product was not manufactured or distributed in

			 (A) may not be construed as establishing the obligation of the

				(3)PackagingIn
			 a health care lawsuit for harm which is alleged to relate to the adequacy of

 Inserted paragraph content is: {"IHEALTH Act 
101.Short titleThis title may be cited as the Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare (HEALTH) Act of 2012. 
102.PurposeIt is the purpose of this title to implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care liability reforms designed to— 
(1)improve the availability of health care services in cases in which health care liability actions have been shown to be a factor in the decreased availability of services; 
(2)reduce the incidence of defensive medicine and lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of which contribute to the escalation of health care costs; 
(3)ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including reasonable noneconomic damages; 
(4)improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our current health care liability system to resolve disputes over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided to injured individuals; and 
(5)provide an increased sharing of information in the health care system which will reduce unintended injury and improve patient care. 
103.Encouraging speedy resolution of claimsThe time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit shall be 3 years after the date of manifestation of injury or 1 year after the claimant discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall the time for commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of the following— 
(1)upon proof of fraud; 
(2)intentional concealment; or 
(3)the presence of a foreign body, which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of the injured person.Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of the alleged manifestation of injury except that actions by a minor under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 years of manifestation of injury or prior to the minor’s 8th birthday, whichever provides a longer period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for minors for any period during which a parent or guardian and a health care provider or health care organization have committed fraud or collusion in the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured minor. 
104.Compensating patient injury 
(a)Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses in Health Care LawsuitsIn any health care lawsuit, nothing in this title shall limit a claimant’s recovery of the full amount of the available economic damages, notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (b). 
(b)Additional Noneconomic DamagesIn any health care lawsuit, the amount of noneconomic damages, if available, may be as much as $250,000, regardless of the number of parties against whom the action is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with respect to the same injury. 
(c)No Discount of Award for Noneconomic DamagesFor purposes of applying the limitation in subsection (b), future noneconomic damages shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not be informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. An award for noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall be reduced either before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the judgment after entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be made before accounting for any other reduction in damages required by law. If separate awards are rendered for past and future noneconomic damages and the combined awards exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be reduced first. 
(d)Fair Share RuleIn any health care lawsuit, each party shall be liable for that party’s several share of any damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each party shall be liable only for the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party’s percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment shall be rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to such party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant’s harm. 
105.Maximizing patient recovery 
(a)Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to ClaimantsIn any health care lawsuit, the court shall supervise the arrangements for payment of damages to protect against conflicts of interest that may have the effect of reducing the amount of damages awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In particular, in any health care lawsuit in which the attorney for a party claims a financial stake in the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court shall have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant’s damage recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the claimant based upon the interests of justice and principles of equity. In no event shall the total of all contingent fees for representing all claimants in a health care lawsuit exceed the following limits: 
(1)Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the claimant(s). 
(2)Thirty-three and one-third percent of the next $50,000 recovered by the claimant(s). 
(3)Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000 recovered by the claimant(s). 
(4)Fifteen percent of any amount by which the recovery by the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000. 
(b)ApplicabilityThe limitations in this section shall apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alternative dispute resolution. In a health care lawsuit involving a minor or incompetent person, a court retains the authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than the maximum permitted under this section. The requirement for court supervision in the first two sentences of subsection (a) applies only in civil actions. 
106.Punitive damages 
(a)In GeneralPunitive damages may, if otherwise permitted by applicable State or Federal law, be awarded against any person in a health care lawsuit only if it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that such person acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant, or that such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain to suffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory damages is rendered against such person, no punitive damages may be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit. No demand for punitive damages shall be included in a health care lawsuit as initially filed. A court may allow a claimant to file an amended pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the claim for punitive damages. At the request of any party in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a separate proceeding— 
(1)whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the amount of such award; and 
(2)the amount of punitive damages following a determination of punitive liability.If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded. 
(b)Determining Amount of Punitive Damages 
(1)Factors consideredIn determining the amount of punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider only the following— 
(A)the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such party; 
(B)the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by such party; 
(C)the profitability of the conduct to such party; 
(D)the number of products sold or medical procedures rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant; 
(E)any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and 
(F)the amount of any civil fines assessed against such party as a result of the conduct complained of by the claimant. 
(2)Maximum awardThe amount of punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit may be as much as $250,000 or as much as two times the amount of economic damages awarded, whichever is greater. The jury shall not be informed of this limitation. 
(c)No Punitive Damages for Products That Comply With FDA Standards 
(1)In general 
(A)No punitive damages may be awarded against the manufacturer or distributor of a medical product, or a supplier of any component or raw material of such medical product, based on a claim that such product caused the claimant’s harm where— 
(i) 
(I)such medical product was subject to premarket approval, clearance, or licensure by the Food and Drug Administration with respect to the safety of the formulation or performance of the aspect of such medical product which caused the claimant’s harm or the adequacy of the packaging or labeling of such medical product; and 
(II)such medical product was so approved, cleared, or licensed; or 
(ii)such medical product is generally recognized among qualified experts as safe and effective pursuant to conditions established by the Food and Drug Administration and applicable Food and Drug Administration regulations, including without limitation those related to packaging and labeling, unless the Food and Drug Administration has determined that such medical product was not manufactured or distributed in substantial compliance with applicable Food and Drug Administration statutes and regulations. 
(B)Rule of constructionSubparagraph (A) may not be construed as establishing the obligation of the Food and Drug Administration to demonstrate affirmatively that a manufacturer, distributor, or supplier referred to in such subparagraph meets any of the conditions described in such subparagraph. 
(2)Liability of health care providersA health care provider who prescribes, or who dispenses pursuant to a prescription, a medical product approved, licensed, or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration shall not be named as a party to a product liability lawsuit involving such product and shall not be liable to a claimant in a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor, or seller of such product. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a court from consolidating cases involving health care providers and cases involving products liability claims against the manufacturer, distributor, or product seller of such medical product.

(2)any defense available to a party in a health care lawsuit under any other provision of State or Federal law.

			 Damages for Products That Comply With FDA Standards
				(1)In
			 general
					(A)No punitive
			 damages may be awarded against the manufacturer or distributor of a medical
			 product, or a supplier of any component or raw material of such medical
			 product, based on a claim that such product caused the claimant’s harm
			 where—
						(i)(I)such medical product was
			 subject to premarket approval, clearance, or licensure by the Food and Drug
			 Administration with respect to the safety of the formulation or performance of
			 the aspect of such medical product which caused the claimant’s harm or the
			 adequacy of the packaging or labeling of such medical product; and
							(II)such medical product was so approved,
			 cleared, or licensed; or
							(ii)such medical
			 product is generally recognized among qualified experts as safe and effective
			 pursuant to conditions established by the Food and Drug Administration and
			 applicable Food and Drug Administration regulations, including without
			 limitation those related to packaging and labeling, unless the Food and Drug
			 Administration has determined that such medical product was not manufactured or
			 distributed in substantial compliance with applicable Food and Drug
			 Administration statutes and regulations.
						(B)Rule of
			 constructionSubparagraph
			 (A) may not be construed as establishing the obligation of the
			 Food and Drug Administration to demonstrate affirmatively that a manufacturer,
			 distributor, or supplier referred to in such subparagraph meets any of the
			 conditions described in such subparagraph.
					(2)Liability of
			 health care providersA health care provider who prescribes, or
			 who dispenses pursuant to a prescription, a medical product approved, licensed,
			 or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration shall not be named as a party to
			 a product liability lawsuit involving such product and shall not be liable to a
			 claimant in a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor, or
			 seller of such product. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a court from
			 consolidating cases involving health care providers and cases involving
			 products liability claims against the manufacturer, distributor, or product
			 seller of such medical product.
				(3)PackagingIn
			 a health care lawsuit for harm which is alleged to relate to the adequacy of
			 the packaging or labeling of a drug which is required to have tamper-resistant
			 packaging under regulations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services
			 (including labeling regulations related to such packaging), the manufacturer or
			 product seller of the drug shall not be held liable for punitive damages unless
			 such packaging or labeling is found by the trier of fact by clear and
			 convincing evidence to be substantially out of compliance with such
			 regulations.
				(4)ExceptionParagraph
			 (1) shall not apply in any health care lawsuit in which—
					(A)a person, before
			 or after premarket approval, clearance, or licensure of such medical product,
			 knowingly misrepresented to or withheld from the Food and Drug Administration
			 information that is required to be submitted under the
			 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
			 (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) that
			 is material and is causally related to the harm which the claimant allegedly
			 suffered;
			 or
					(B)a person made an
			 illegal payment to an official of the Food and Drug Administration for the
			 purpose of either securing or maintaining approval, clearance, or licensure of
			 such medical product.;
			 or
					(C)the defendant
			 caused the medical product which caused the claimant’s harm to be misbranded or
			 adulterated (as such terms are used in chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and
			 Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C 351 et seq.)).

 Inserted paragraph content is: {"IHEALTH Act 
101.Short titleThis title may be cited as the Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare (HEALTH) Act of 2012. 
102.PurposeIt is the purpose of this title to implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care liability reforms designed to— 
(1)improve the availability of health care services in cases in which health care liability actions have been shown to be a factor in the decreased availability of services; 
(2)reduce the incidence of defensive medicine and lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of which contribute to the escalation of health care costs; 
(3)ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including reasonable noneconomic damages; 
(4)improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our current health care liability system to resolve disputes over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided to injured individuals; and 
(5)provide an increased sharing of information in the health care system which will reduce unintended injury and improve patient care. 
103.Encouraging speedy resolution of claimsThe time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit shall be 3 years after the date of manifestation of injury or 1 year after the claimant discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall the time for commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of the following— 
(1)upon proof of fraud; 
(2)intentional concealment; or 
(3)the presence of a foreign body, which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of the injured person.Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of the alleged manifestation of injury except that actions by a minor under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 years of manifestation of injury or prior to the minor’s 8th birthday, whichever provides a longer period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for minors for any period during which a parent or guardian and a health care provider or health care organization have committed fraud or collusion in the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured minor. 
104.Compensating patient injury 
(a)Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses in Health Care LawsuitsIn any health care lawsuit, nothing in this title shall limit a claimant’s recovery of the full amount of the available economic damages, notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (b). 
(b)Additional Noneconomic DamagesIn any health care lawsuit, the amount of noneconomic damages, if available, may be as much as $250,000, regardless of the number of parties against whom the action is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with respect to the same injury. 
(c)No Discount of Award for Noneconomic DamagesFor purposes of applying the limitation in subsection (b), future noneconomic damages shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not be informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. An award for noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall be reduced either before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the judgment after entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be made before accounting for any other reduction in damages required by law. If separate awards are rendered for past and future noneconomic damages and the combined awards exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be reduced first. 
(d)Fair Share RuleIn any health care lawsuit, each party shall be liable for that party’s several share of any damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each party shall be liable only for the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party’s percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment shall be rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to such party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant’s harm. 
105.Maximizing patient recovery 
(a)Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to ClaimantsIn any health care lawsuit, the court shall supervise the arrangements for payment of damages to protect against conflicts of interest that may have the effect of reducing the amount of damages awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In particular, in any health care lawsuit in which the attorney for a party claims a financial stake in the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court shall have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant’s damage recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the claimant based upon the interests of justice and principles of equity. In no event shall the total of all contingent fees for representing all claimants in a health care lawsuit exceed the following limits: 
(1)Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the claimant(s). 
(2)Thirty-three and one-third percent of the next $50,000 recovered by the claimant(s). 
(3)Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000 recovered by the claimant(s). 
(4)Fifteen percent of any amount by which the recovery by the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000. 
(b)ApplicabilityThe limitations in this section shall apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alternative dispute resolution. In a health care lawsuit involving a minor or incompetent person, a court retains the authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than the maximum permitted under this section. The requirement for court supervision in the first two sentences of subsection (a) applies only in civil actions. 
106.Punitive damages 
(a)In GeneralPunitive damages may, if otherwise permitted by applicable State or Federal law, be awarded against any person in a health care lawsuit only if it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that such person acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant, or that such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain to suffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory damages is rendered against such person, no punitive damages may be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit. No demand for punitive damages shall be included in a health care lawsuit as initially filed. A court may allow a claimant to file an amended pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the claim for punitive damages. At the request of any party in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a separate proceeding— 
(1)whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the amount of such award; and 
(2)the amount of punitive damages following a determination of punitive liability.If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded. 
(b)Determining Amount of Punitive Damages 
(1)Factors consideredIn determining the amount of punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider only the following— 
(A)the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such party; 
(B)the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by such party; 
(C)the profitability of the conduct to such party; 
(D)the number of products sold or medical procedures rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant; 
(E)any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and 
(F)the amount of any civil fines assessed against such party as a result of the conduct complained of by the claimant. 
(2)Maximum awardThe amount of punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit may be as much as $250,000 or as much as two times the amount of economic damages awarded, whichever is greater. The jury shall not be informed of this limitation. 
(c)No Punitive Damages for Products That Comply With FDA Standards 
(1)In general 
(A)No punitive damages may be awarded against the manufacturer or distributor of a medical product, or a supplier of any component or raw material of such medical product, based on a claim that such product caused the claimant’s harm where— 
(i) 
(I)such medical product was subject to premarket approval, clearance, or licensure by the Food and Drug Administration with respect to the safety of the formulation or performance of the aspect of such medical product which caused the claimant’s harm or the adequacy of the packaging or labeling of such medical product; and 
(II)such medical product was so approved, cleared, or licensed; or 
(ii)such medical product is generally recognized among qualified experts as safe and effective pursuant to conditions established by the Food and Drug Administration and applicable Food and Drug Administration regulations, including without limitation those related to packaging and labeling, unless the Food and Drug Administration has determined that such medical product was not manufactured or distributed in substantial compliance with applicable Food and Drug Administration statutes and regulations. 
(B)Rule of constructionSubparagraph (A) may not be construed as establishing the obligation of the Food and Drug Administration to demonstrate affirmatively that a manufacturer, distributor, or supplier referred to in such subparagraph meets any of the conditions described in such subparagraph. 
(2)Liability of health care providersA health care provider who prescribes, or who dispenses pursuant to a prescription, a medical product approved, licensed, or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration shall not be named as a party to a product liability lawsuit involving such product and shall not be liable to a claimant in a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor, or seller of such product. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a court from consolidating cases involving health care providers and cases involving products liability claims against the manufacturer, distributor, or product seller of such medical product. 
(3)PackagingIn a health care lawsuit for harm which is alleged to relate to the adequacy of the packaging or labeling of a drug which is required to have tamper-resistant packaging under regulations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (including labeling regulations related to such packaging), the manufacturer or product seller of the drug shall not be held liable for punitive damages unless such packaging or labeling is found by the trier of fact by clear and convincing evidence to be substantially out of compliance with such regulations. 
(4)ExceptionParagraph (1) shall not apply in any health care lawsuit in which— 
(A)a person, before or after premarket approval, clearance, or licensure of such medical product, knowingly misrepresented to or withheld from the Food and Drug Administration information that is required to be submitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) that is material and is causally related to the harm which the claimant allegedly suffered; 
(B)a person made an illegal payment to an official of the Food and Drug Administration for the purpose of either securing or maintaining approval, clearance, or licensure of such medical product; or 
(C)the defendant caused the medical product which caused the claimant’s harm to be misbranded or adulterated (as such terms are used in chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.)). 
107.Authorization of payment of future damages to claimants in health care lawsuits 
(a)In GeneralIn any health care lawsuit, if an award of future damages, without reduction to present value, equaling or exceeding $50,000 is made against a party with sufficient insurance or other assets to fund a periodic payment of such a judgment, the court shall, at the request of any party, enter a judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by periodic payments, in accordance with the Uniform Periodic Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. 
(b)ApplicabilityThis section applies to all actions which have not been first set for trial or retrial before the effective date of this title.
