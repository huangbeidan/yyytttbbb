(2)Recommendations of north pacific councilThe North Pacific Council may recommend for approval by the Secretary such conservation and management measures, including size limits and measures to control fishing capacity, in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act as it considers necessary to ensure that this subsection does not diminish the effectiveness of fishery management plans of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area or the Gulf of Alaska. 
(3)Special rule for replacement of certain vessels 
(A)In generalNotwithstanding the requirements of subsections (b)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of section 12113 of title 46, United States Code, a vessel that is eligible under subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) (other than paragraph (21)) and that qualifies to be documented with a fishery endorsement pursuant to section 203(g) or 213(g) may be replaced with a replacement vessel under paragraph (1) if the vessel that is replaced is validly documented with a fishery endorsement pursuant to section 203(g) or 213(g) before the replacement vessel is documented with a fishery endorsement under section 12113 of title 46, United States Code. 
(B)ApplicabilityA replacement vessel under subparagraph (A) and its owner and mortgagee are subject to the same limitations under section 203(g) or 213(g) that are applicable to the vessel that has been replaced and its owner and mortgagee. 
(4)Special rules for certain catcher vessels 
(A)In generalA replacement for a covered vessel described in subparagraph (B) is prohibited from harvesting fish in any fishery (except for the Pacific whiting fishery) managed under the authority of any regional fishery management council (other than the North Pacific Council) established under section 302(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 
(B)Covered vesselsA covered vessel referred to in subparagraph (A) is— 
(i)a vessel eligible under subsection (a), (b), or (c) that is replaced under paragraph (1); or 
(ii)a vessel eligible under subsection (a), (b), or (c) that is rebuilt to increase its registered length, gross tonnage, or shaft horsepower. 
(5)Limitation on fishery endorsementsAny vessel that is replaced under this subsection shall thereafter not be eligible for a fishery endorsement under section 12113 of title 46, United States Code, unless that vessel is also a replacement vessel described in paragraph (1). 
(6)Gulf of Alaska limitationNotwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary shall prohibit from participation in the groundfish fisheries of the Gulf of Alaska any vessel that is rebuilt or replaced under this subsection and that exceeds the maximum length overall specified on the license that authorizes fishing for groundfish pursuant to the license limitation program under part 679 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of enactment of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2008.

(2)Recommendations of north pacific councilThe North Pacific Council may recommend for approval by the Secretary such conservation and management measures, including size limits and measures to control fishing capacity, in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act as it considers necessary to ensure that this subsection does not diminish the effectiveness of fishery management plans of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area or the Gulf of Alaska. 
(3)Special rule for replacement of certain vessels 
(A)In generalNotwithstanding the requirements of subsections (b)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of section 12113 of title 46, United States Code, a vessel that is eligible under subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) (other than paragraph (21)) and that qualifies to be documented with a fishery endorsement pursuant to section 203(g) or 213(g) may be replaced with a replacement vessel under paragraph (1) if the vessel that is replaced is validly documented with a fishery endorsement pursuant to section 203(g) or 213(g) before the replacement vessel is documented with a fishery endorsement under section 12113 of title 46, United States Code.
