This includes development, placement, and dissemination of Public Service Announcements in newspaper, radio, television, and other media. It will also include school presentations, brochures and materials, support for public awareness campaigns, and related support for the activities of Operation Lifesaver’s member organizations.
(b)Pilot programFunds provided under subsection (a) may also be used by Operation Lifesaver to implement a pilot program, to be known as the Railroad Safety Public Awareness Program, that addresses the need for targeted, sustained community outreach on the subjects described in subsection (a). Such pilot program shall be established in States and communities where risk is greatest, in terms of the number of crashes and population density near the railroad, including residences, businesses, and schools. Such pilot program shall be carried out through grants to Operation Lifesaver for work with community leaders, school districts, and public and private partners to identify the communities at greatest risk, and through development of an implementation plan. An evaluation component requirement shall be included in the grant to measure results.

20165.Fostering introduction of new technology to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings
(a)Findings
(1)Collisions between highway users and trains at highway-rail grade crossings continue to cause an unacceptable loss of life and serious personal injury and also threaten the safety of rail transportation.
(2)While elimination of at-grade crossings through consolidation of crossings and grade separations offers the greatest long-term promise for optimizing the safety and efficiency of the two modes of transportation, over 140,000 public grade crossings remain on the general rail system—approximately one for each route mile on the general rail system.
(3)Conventional highway traffic control devices such as flashing lights and gates are effective in warning motorists of a train’s approach to an equipped crossing.
(4)Since enactment of the Highway Safety Act of 1973, over $4,200,000,000 of Federal funding has been invested in safety improvements at highway-rail grade crossings, yet a majority of public highway-rail grade crossings are not yet equipped with active warning systems.
(5)The emergence of new technologies supporting Intelligent Transportation Systems presents opportunities for more effective and affordable warnings and safer passage of highway users and trains at remaining highway-rail grade crossings.
(6)Implementation of new crossing safety technology will require extensive cooperation between highway authorities and railroad carriers.
(7)Federal Railroad Safety Administration regulations establishing performance standards for processor-based signal and train control systems provide a suitable framework for qualification of new or novel technology at highway-rail grade crossings, and the Federal Highway Administration’s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices provides an appropriate means of determining highway user interface with such new technology.
(b)PolicyIt is the policy of the United States to encourage the development of new technology that can prevent loss of life and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings. The Secretary of Transportation is designated to carry out this policy in consultation with States and necessary public and private entities..
(b)Table of sections amendmentThe table of sections for chapter 201 of title 49, United States Code, as amended by this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the following new item:
