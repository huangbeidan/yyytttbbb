(E)issue notices, when appropriate, to require owners of levees to perform necessary maintenance or remedial work, improve security, revise operating procedures, or take other actions, including breaching levees when necessary; 
(F)provide necessary funds from State sources or by requiring levee owners to pay for timely repairs or other changes to, or removal of, a levee in order to protect human life and property; 
(G)establish a system of emergency procedures to be used by the State, or required to be used by levee owners, if a levee fails or the failure of a levee is imminent;

(ii)the maximum area that could be flooded if the levee failed; and

(I)issue regulations necessary to carry out the program. 
(3)Budgeting requirementTo be eligible for assistance under this subsection, a State shall allocate sufficient funds in its budget to carry out a State levee safety program.

(5)Maintenance of effortAssistance may not be provided to a State under this subsection for a fiscal year unless the State enters into such agreement with the Secretary as the Secretary requires to ensure that the State will maintain the aggregate expenditures of the State from all other sources for programs to ensure levee safety for the protection of human life and property at or above a level equal to the average annual level of such expenditures for the 2 fiscal years preceding the fiscal year. 
(6)Approval of programs 
(A)SubmissionTo be eligible for assistance under this subsection, a State shall submit to the Secretary a State levee safety program and receive the Secretary’s approval of the program. 
(B)Approval

(ii)Deemed approvalA program submitted by a State under subparagraph (A) shall be deemed to be approved by the Secretary on the 120th day following the date of the Secretary’s receipt of the program unless the Secretary before such 120th day approves or disapproves the program. 
(C)Notification of disapprovalIf the Secretary determines that a program submitted by a State under subparagraph (A) does not substantially meet the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall disapprove the program, immediately notify the State in writing of the disapproval, and provide the reasons for the disapproval and the changes that are necessary for the program to be approved. 
(7)Reviews of state levee safety programs 
(A)Periodic reviewsThe Secretary shall periodically review State levee safety programs. 
(B)Revocation of program approvalIf the Secretary finds that a State levee safety program has proven inadequate to reasonably protect human life and property, the Secretary shall revoke approval of the State levee safety program, and withhold assistance under this subsection, until the State levee safety program again substantially meets the requirements for approval.

(1)In generalTo encourage the establishment and maintenance of effective State programs intended to ensure levee safety, to protect human life and public property, and to improve State levee safety programs, the Secretary shall provide assistance, using amounts made to carry out this Act, to assist States in establishing and carrying out levee safety programs. 
(2)CriteriaTo be eligible for assistance under this subsection, a State shall have in effect a State levee safety program under which the State levee safety agency shall, in accordance with State law— 
(A)review and approve plans and specifications to construct, enlarge, modify, remove, and abandon levees; 
(B)perform periodic inspections during levee construction to ensure compliance with approved plans and specifications;  
(C)require or perform the inspection, at least once every 5 years, of all levees that would pose a significant threat to human life and public property in case of failure to determine the continued safety of the levees and a procedure for more detailed and frequent safety inspections; 
(D)require that all inspections of levees be performed under the supervision of a State-registered professional engineer with related experience in levee design and construction;  
(E)issue notices, when appropriate, to require owners of levees to perform necessary maintenance or remedial work, improve security, revise operating procedures, or take other actions, including breaching levees when necessary;  
(F)provide necessary funds— 
(i)to ensure timely repairs or other changes to, or removal of, a levee in order to protect human life and public property; and 
(ii)if the owner of the levee does not take an action described in clause (i), to take appropriate action as expeditiously as practicable;  
(G)establish a system of emergency procedures to be used if a levee fails or if the failure of a levee is imminent; 
(H)identify— 
(i)each levee the failure of which could be reasonably expected to endanger human life; 
(ii)the maximum area that could be flooded if the levee failed; and 
(iii)necessary public facilities that would be affected by the flooding; and 
(I)issue regulations to carry out the program.   
(3)Budgeting requirementTo be eligible for assistance under this subsection, a State shall allocate sufficient funds in its budget to carry out a State levee safety program.  
(4)Work plansThe Secretary shall enter into an agreement with each State receiving assistance under this subsection to develop a work plan necessary for the State levee safety program to reach a level of program performance specified in the agreement. 
(5)Maintenance of effortAssistance may not be provided to a State under this subsection for a fiscal year unless the State enters into such agreement with the Secretary as the Secretary requires to ensure that the State will maintain the aggregate expenditures of the State from all other sources for programs to ensure levee safety for the protection of human life and property at or above a level equal to the average annual level of such expenditures for the 2 fiscal years preceding the fiscal year.  
(6)Approval of programs 
(A)SubmissionTo be eligible for assistance under this subsection, a State shall submit to the Secretary a State levee safety program and receive the Secretary’s approval of the program. 
(B)Approval 
(i)In generalIf the Secretary determines that a program submitted by a State under subparagraph (A) substantially meets the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall approve the program and immediately notify the State in writing of the approval. 
(ii)Deemed approvalA program submitted by a State under subparagraph (A) shall be deemed to be approved by the Secretary on the 120th day following the date of the Secretary’s receipt of the program unless the Secretary before such 120th day approves or disapproves the program. 
(C)Notification of disapprovalIf the Secretary determines that a program submitted by a State under subparagraph (A) does not substantially meet the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall disapprove the program, immediately notify the State in writing of the disapproval, and provide the reasons for the disapproval and the changes that are necessary for the program to be approved.  
(7)Reviews of state levee safety programs 
(A)Periodic reviewsUsing the expertise of the Board, the Secretary shall periodically review State levee safety programs. 
(B)Revocation of program approvalIf the Board finds that a State levee safety program has proven inadequate to reasonably protect human life and public property and the Secretary concurs, the Secretary shall revoke approval of the State levee safety program, and withhold assistance under this subsection, until the State levee safety program again substantially meets the requirements for approval.
