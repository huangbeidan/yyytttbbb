		1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the
			 Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act of
			 2011.
		2.Temporary prohibition
			 against revising any national ambient air quality standard applicable to coarse
			 particulate matterBefore the
			 date that is one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the
			 Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may not propose, finalize,
			 implement, or enforce any regulation revising the national primary ambient air
			 quality standard or the national secondary ambient air quality standard
			 applicable to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter greater than 2.5
			 micrometers under section 109 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7409).
		3.Nuisance
			 dustPart A of title I of the
			 Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the
			 following:
			
				132.Regulation of nuisance
				dust primarily by State, tribal, and local governments
					(a)In
				generalExcept as provided in
				subsection (b), this Act does not apply to, and references in this Act to
				particulate matter are deemed to exclude, nuisance dust.
					(b)ExceptionSubsection (a) does not apply with respect
				to any geographic area in which nuisance dust is not regulated under State,
				tribal, or local law insofar as the Administrator finds that—
						(1)nuisance dust (or any subcategory of
				nuisance dust) causes substantial adverse public health and welfare effects at
				ambient concentrations; and
						(2)the benefits of applying standards and
				other requirements of this Act to nuisance dust (or such subcategory of
				nuisance dust) outweigh the costs (including local and regional economic and
				employment impacts) of applying such standards and other requirements to
				nuisance dust (or such subcategory).
						(c)DefinitionIn this section—
						(1)the term nuisance
				dust means particulate matter that—
							(A)is generated primarily
				from natural sources, unpaved roads, agricultural activities, earth moving, or
				other activities typically conducted in rural areas;
							(B)consists primarily of
				soil, other natural or biological materials, or some combination
				thereof;
							(C)is not emitted directly
				into the ambient air from combustion, such as exhaust from combustion engines
				and emissions from stationary combustion processes; and
							(D)is not comprised of
				residuals from the combustion of coal; and
							(2)the term nuisance dust does
				not include radioactive particulate matter produced from uranium mining or
				processing.
