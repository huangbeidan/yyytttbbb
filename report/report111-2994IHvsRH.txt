			 Act of 1934 is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
			
				342.Process for issuing
				qualified carrier certification
					(a)CertificationThe Commission shall issue a certification
				for the purposes of section 119(g)(3)(A)(iii) of title 17, United States Code,
				if the Commission determines that—
						(1)a satellite carrier is
				providing local service pursuant to the statutory license under section 122 of
				such title in each designated market area; and
						(2)with respect to each
				designated market area in which such satellite carrier was not providing such
				local service as of the date of enactment of the
				Satellite Home Viewer Reauthorization Act of
				2009—
							(A)the satellite carrier’s
				satellite beams are designed, and predicted by the satellite manufacturer’s
				pre-launch test data, to provide a good quality satellite signal to 90 percent
				of the households in each such designated market area based on the most recent
				census data released by the United States Census Bureau; and
							(B)there is no material
				evidence that there has been a satellite or sub-system failure subsequent to
				the satellite’s launch that precludes the ability of the satellite carrier to
				satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (A).
							(b)Information
				requiredAny entity seeking
				the certification provided for in subsection (a) shall submit to the Commission
				the following information:
						(1)An affidavit stating that, to the best of
				the affiant’s knowledge, the satellite carrier provides local service in all
				designated market areas pursuant to the statutory license provided for in
				section 122 of title 17, United States Code, and listing those designated
				market areas in which local service was provided as of the date of enactment of
				the Satellite Home Viewer Reauthorization Act
				of 2009.
						(2)For each designated market area not listed
				in paragraph (1):
							(A)Identification of each such designated
				market area and the location of its local receive facility.
							(B)Data showing the number of households, and
				maps showing the geographic distribution thereof, in each such designated
				market area based on the most recent census data released by the United States
				Census Bureau.
							(C)Maps, with superimposed effective
				isotropically radiated power predictions obtained in the satellite
				manufacturer’s pre-launch tests, showing that the contours of the carrier’s
				satellite beams as designed and the geographic area that the carrier’s
				satellite beams are designed to cover are predicted to provide a good quality
				satellite signal to 90 percent of the households in such designated market area
				based on the most recent census data released by the United States Census
				Bureau.
							(D)For any satellite relied upon for
				certification under this section, an affidavit stating that, to the best of the
				affiant’s knowledge, there have been no satellite or sub-system failures
				subsequent to the satellite’s launch that would degrade the design performance
				to such a degree that a satellite transponder used to provide local service to
				any such designated market area is precluded from delivering a good quality
				satellite signal to 90 percent of the households in such designated market area
				based on the most recent census data released by the United States Census
				Bureau.
							(E)Any additional engineering, designated
				market area, or other information the Commission considers necessary to
				determine whether the Commission shall grant a certification under this
				section.
							(c)Certification
				Issuance
						(1)Public
				commentThe Commission shall provide 30 days for public comment
				on a request for certification under this section.
						(2)Deadline for
				decisionThe Commission shall grant or deny a request for
				certification within 90 days after the date on which such request is
				filed.
						(d)Subsequent
				affirmationAn entity granted
				qualified carrier status pursuant to section 119(g) of title 17, United States
				Code, shall file an affidavit with the Commission 30 months after such status
				was granted stating that, to the best of the affiant’s knowledge, it is in
				compliance with the requirements for a qualified carrier.
					(e)DefinitionsFor the purposes of this section:
						(1)Designated Market
				AreaThe term
				designated market area has the meaning given such term in
				section 122(j)(2)(C) of title 17, United States Code.
						(2)Good quality satellite
				signal
							(A)In
				generalThe term “good quality satellite signal” means—
								(i)a satellite signal whose
				power level as designed shall achieve reception and demodulation of the signal
				at an availability level of at least 99.7 percent using models of satellite
				antennas normally used by the satellite carrier’s subscribers and the same
				calculation methodology used by the satellite carrier to determine predicted
				signal availability in the top 100 designated market areas; and
								(ii)a video signal
				transmitted by satellite carrier such that, taking into account whether a
				signal is in standard definition format or high definition format, compression
				methodology, modulation, error correction, power level, and utilization of
				advances in technology that does not circumvent the intent of this section to
				provide for non-discriminatory treatment with respect to any comparable
				television broadcast station signal—
									(I)the satellite carrier
				treats all television broadcast station’s signals the same with respect to
				statistical multiplexer prioritization; and
									(II)the number of video
				signals in the relevant satellite transponder is not more than the then current
				greatest number of video signals carried on any equivalent transponder serving
				the top 100 designated market areas.
									(B)DeterminationFor
				the purposes of subparagraph (A), the top 100 designated market areas shall be
				as determined by Nielsen Media Research and published in the Nielsen Station
				Index Directory and Nielsen Station Index United States Television Household
				Estimates or any successor publication as of the date of a satellite carrier’s
				application for certification under this
				section.
