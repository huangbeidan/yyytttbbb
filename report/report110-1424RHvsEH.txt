				(a)Extension of

			 requirementsSection 712 of the Employee Retirement Income
			 Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1185a) is amended—
					(1)in subsection (a),
			 by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
						
							(3)Treatment
				limitsIn the case of a group
				health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health
				or substance-related disorder benefits—
								(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services, the plan or coverage may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
								(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health or substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that is more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following five categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
									(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services not described in clause (v)
				furnished on an inpatient basis and within a network of providers established
				or recognized under such plan or coverage.
									(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an inpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
									(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services
				not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and within a
				network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
									(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
									(v)Emergency
				careItems and services, whether furnished on an inpatient or
				outpatient basis or within or outside any network of providers, required for
				the treatment of an emergency medical condition (as defined in section 1867(e)
				of the Social Security Act, including
				an emergency condition relating to mental health or substance-related
				disorders).
									(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or coverage.
								(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
								(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirementsIn the
				case of a group health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits
				and mental health or substance-related disorder benefits—
								(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified under paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not
				impose such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health or
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category.
								(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
									(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services (as specified in paragraph
				(3)(C)), the plan or coverage shall apply such requirement (or, if there is
				more than one such requirement for such category of items and services, the
				predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and surgical
				benefits within such category and to mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits within such category and shall not distinguish in the
				application of such requirement between such medical and surgical benefits and
				such mental health and substance-related disorder benefits.
									(ii)Other financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause
				(i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of
				items and services, the plan or coverage may not impose such financial
				requirement on mental health or substance-related disorder benefits for items
				and services within such category in a way that results in greater
				out-of-pocket expenses to the participant or beneficiary than the predominant
				beneficiary financial requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits
				for items and services within such category.
									(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing,
				and limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or
				beneficiary with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not
				include the application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

				health and substance-related disorder benefits (or the health insurance
				coverage offered in connection with the plan with respect to such benefits)
				shall be made available by the plan administrator (or the health insurance
				issuer offering such coverage) in accordance with regulations to any current or
				potential participant, beneficiary, or contracting provider upon request. The
				reason for any denial under the plan (or coverage) of reimbursement or payment
				for services with respect to mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits in the case of any participant or beneficiary shall, on request or as
				otherwise required, be made available by the plan administrator (or the health
				insurance issuer offering such coverage) to the participant or beneficiary in

				any mental health or substance-related disorder benefits, the plan or coverage
				shall include benefits for any mental health condition or substance-related
				disorder included in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
				Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric
				Association.
							(B)Equity in
				coverage of out-of-network benefits
								(i)In
				generalIn the case of a plan or coverage that provides both
				medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits, if medical and surgical benefits are provided for substantially all
				items and services in a category specified in clause (ii) furnished outside any
				network of providers established or recognized under such plan or coverage, the
				mental health and substance-related disorder benefits shall also be provided
				for items and services in such category furnished outside any network of
				providers established or recognized under such plan or coverage in accordance
				with the requirements of this section.

				a plan), if the application of this section to such plan (or coverage) results
				in an increase for the plan year involved of the actual total costs of coverage
				with respect to medical and surgical benefits and mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits under the plan (as determined and certified
				under subparagraph (C)) by an amount that exceeds the applicable percentage
				described in subparagraph (B) of the actual total plan costs, the provisions of
				this section shall not apply to such plan (or coverage) during the following
				plan year, and such exemption shall apply to the plan (or coverage) for 1 plan
				year.

				of Actuaries. Such determinations shall be made available by the plan
				administrator (or health insurance issuer, as the case may be) to the general
				public.
							(D)6-month

				issuer offering coverage in connection with such a plan) seeks an exemption

We are at location: null   Compared with location: bill[1]/legis-body[1]/division[2]
The reason of change is: insertion
The value is expected to be: null But actually it is: division
 Inserted paragraph content is: {"BGenetic
			 Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008
			100.Short title;
			 findings
				(a)Short
			 titleThis division may be cited as the
			 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.
				(b)FindingsCongress
			 makes the following findings:
					(1)Deciphering the
			 sequence of the human genome and other advances in genetics open major new
			 opportunities for medical progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of
			 illness will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms
			 have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps to reduce the
			 likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. New knowledge about
			 genetics may allow for the development of better therapies that are more
			 effective against disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments.
			 These advances give rise to the potential misuse of genetic information to
			 discriminate in health insurance and employment.
					(2)The early science
			 of genetics became the basis of State laws that provided for the sterilization
			 of persons having presumed genetic defects such as mental
			 retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other
			 conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State of Indiana in
			 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted sterilization laws to
			 correct apparent genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these
			 State laws have since been repealed, and many have been modified to include
			 essential constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.
			 However, the current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of
			 sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, compels
			 Congressional action in this area.
					(3)Although genes are
			 facially neutral markers, many genetic conditions and disorders are associated
			 with particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some genetic
			 traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular group
			 may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of that genetic
			 information. This form of discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw
			 the advent of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a
			 disease which afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began
			 to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s began
			 mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia,
			 leading to discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this
			 stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act,
			 which withholds Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is
			 voluntary.
					(4)Congress has been
			 informed of examples of genetic discrimination in the workplace. These include
			 the use of pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
			 which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that case
			 Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir.
			 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the fear
			 of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice in employment and
			 health insurance.
					(5)Federal law
			 addressing genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment is
			 incomplete in both the scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many
			 States have enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws
			 vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and level of
			 protection. Congress has collected substantial evidence that the American
			 public and the medical community find the existing patchwork of State and
			 Federal laws to be confusing and inadequate to protect them from
			 discrimination. Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and
			 uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from
			 discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination,
			 thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing,
			 technologies, research, and new therapies.

						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services, the plan or coverage may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health or substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that is more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
							(C)Categories of items and
				services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary financial
				requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (4),
				there shall be the following five categories of items and services for
				benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits and
				all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into one
				of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services not described in clause (v)
				furnished on an inpatient basis and within a network of providers established
				or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an inpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services
				not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and within a
				network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(v)Emergency
				careItems and services, whether furnished on an inpatient or
				outpatient basis or within or outside any network of providers, required for
				the treatment of an emergency medical condition (including an emergency
				condition relating to mental health and substance-related disorders).
								(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or coverage.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary financial
				requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified under paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not
				impose such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health or
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category.
							(B)Beneficiary financial
				requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services (as specified in paragraph
				(3)(C)), the plan or coverage shall apply such requirement (or, if there is
				more than one such requirement for such category of items and services, the
				predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and surgical
				benefits within such category and to mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits within such category and shall not distinguish in the
				application of such requirement between such medical and surgical benefits and
				such mental health and substance-related disorder benefits.
								(ii)Other financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause
				(i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of
				items and services, the plan or coverage may not impose such financial
				requirement on mental health or substance-related disorder benefits for items
				and services within such category in a way that results in greater
				out-of-pocket expenses to the participant or beneficiary than the predominant
				beneficiary financial requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits
				for items and services within such category.
								(iii)ConstructionNothing in this subparagraph shall be
				construed as prohibiting the plan or coverage from waiving the application of
				any deductible for mental health benefits or substance-related disorder
				benefits or both.
								(C)Beneficiary financial
				requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term
				beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a plan
				or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing, and
				limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or beneficiary
				with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not include the
				application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services (specified in subparagraph (C)),
				the plan or coverage may not impose any treatment limit on mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits that are classified in the same category of
				items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that are more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
							(C)Categories of items and
				services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary financial
				requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (4),
				there shall be the following four categories of items and services for
				benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits and
				all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into one
				of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis and
				within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an inpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient basis
				and within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an outpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or coverage.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary financial
				requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified in paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not impose
				such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits for items and services within such category.
							(B)Beneficiary financial
				requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services, the plan or coverage shall
				apply such requirement (or, if there is more than one such requirement for such
				category of items and services, the predominant requirement for such category)
				both to medical and surgical benefits within such category and to mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits within such category and shall not
				distinguish in the application of such requirement between such medical and
				surgical benefits and such mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits.
								(ii)Other financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause
				(i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of
				items and services, the plan or coverage may not impose such financial
				requirement on mental health and substance-related disorder benefits for items
				and services within such category in a way that is more costly to the
				participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary financial
				requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(C)Beneficiary financial
				requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term
				beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a plan
				or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing, and
				limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or beneficiary
				with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not include the
				application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan does not include a treatment limit (as defined
				in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any
				category of items or services (specified in subparagraph (C)), the plan may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan includes a treatment limit on substantially all
				medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or services, the plan
				may not impose such a treatment limit on mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits for items and services within such category that are more
				restrictive than the predominant treatment limit that is applicable to medical
				and surgical benefits for items and services within such category.
							(C)Categories of items and
				services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary financial
				requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (4),
				there shall be the following four categories of items and services for
				benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits and
				all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into one
				of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis and
				within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an inpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient basis
				and within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an outpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan, limitation on the frequency of
				treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar limit on the
				duration or scope of treatment under the plan.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary financial
				requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan does not include a beneficiary
				financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on substantially all
				medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and services
				(specified in paragraph (3)(C)), the plan may not impose such a beneficiary
				financial requirement on mental health and substance-related disorder benefits
				for items and services within such category.
							(B)Beneficiary financial
				requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services, the plan or coverage shall
				apply such requirement (or, if there is more than one such requirement for such
				category of items and services, the predominant requirement for such category)
				both to medical and surgical benefits within such category and to mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits within such category and shall not
				distinguish in the application of such requirement between such medical and
				surgical benefits and such mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits.
								(ii)Other financial
				requirementsIf the plan
				includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause (i) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services, the plan may not impose such financial requirement on mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category in a way that is more costly to the participant or beneficiary than
				the predominant beneficiary financial requirement applicable to medical and
				surgical benefits for items and services within such category.
								(C)Beneficiary financial
				requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term
				beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing, and
				limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or beneficiary
				with respect to benefits under the plan, but does not include the application
				of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

			102.Amendments to the
			 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
				(a)Extension of
			 parity to treatment limits and beneficiary financial
			 requirementsSection 712 of the Employee Retirement Income
			 Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1185a) is amended—
					(1)in subsection (a),
			 by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
						
							(3)Treatment
				limitsIn the case of a group
				health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health
				or substance-related disorder benefits—
								(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services, the plan or coverage may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
								(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health or substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that is more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following five categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
									(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services not described in clause (v)
				furnished on an inpatient basis and within a network of providers established
				or recognized under such plan or coverage.
									(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an inpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
									(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services
				not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and within a
				network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
									(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
									(v)Emergency
				careItems and services, whether furnished on an inpatient or
				outpatient basis or within or outside any network of providers, required for
				the treatment of an emergency medical condition (as defined in section 1867(e)
				of the Social Security Act, including
				an emergency condition relating to mental health or substance-related
				disorders).
									(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or coverage.
								(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
								(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirementsIn the
				case of a group health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits
				and mental health or substance-related disorder benefits—
								(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified under paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not
				impose such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health or
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category.
								(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
									(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services (as specified in paragraph
				(3)(C)), the plan or coverage shall apply such requirement (or, if there is
				more than one such requirement for such category of items and services, the
				predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and surgical
				benefits within such category and to mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits within such category and shall not distinguish in the
				application of such requirement between such medical and surgical benefits and
				such mental health and substance-related disorder benefits.
									(ii)Other financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause
				(i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of
				items and services, the plan or coverage may not impose such financial
				requirement on mental health or substance-related disorder benefits for items
				and services within such category in a way that results in greater
				out-of-pocket expenses to the participant or beneficiary than the predominant
				beneficiary financial requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits
				for items and services within such category.
									(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing,
				and limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or
				beneficiary with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not
				include the application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

				disorder benefitsThe term
				substance-related disorder benefits means benefits with respect
				to services for substance-related disorders, as defined under the terms of the
				plan and in accordance with applicable
				law.

					(c)Availability of
			 plan information about criteria for medical necessitySubsection (a) of such section, as amended
			 by subsection (a)(1), is further amended by adding at the end the following new
			 paragraph:
					
						(5)Availability of
				plan informationThe criteria
				for medical necessity determinations made under the plan with respect to mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits (or the health insurance
				coverage offered in connection with the plan with respect to such benefits)
				shall be made available by the plan administrator (or the health insurance
				issuer offering such coverage) in accordance with regulations to any current or
				potential participant, beneficiary, or contracting provider upon request. The
				reason for any denial under the plan (or coverage) of reimbursement or payment
				for services with respect to mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits in the case of any participant or beneficiary shall, on request or as
				otherwise required, be made available by the plan administrator (or the health
				insurance issuer offering such coverage) to the participant or beneficiary in
				accordance with
				regulations.
						.
				(d)Minimum benefit
			 requirementsSubsection (a) of such section is further amended by
			 adding at the end the following new paragraph:
					
						(6)Minimum scope of
				coverage and equity in out-of-network benefits
							(A)Minimum scope of
				mental health and substance-related disorder benefitsIn the case of a group health plan (or
				health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides
				any mental health or substance-related disorder benefits, the plan or coverage
				shall include benefits for any mental health condition or substance-related
				disorder included in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
				Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric
				Association.
							(B)Equity in
				coverage of out-of-network benefits
								(i)In
				generalIn the case of a plan or coverage that provides both
				medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits, if medical and surgical benefits are provided for substantially all
				items and services in a category specified in clause (ii) furnished outside any
				network of providers established or recognized under such plan or coverage, the
				mental health and substance-related disorder benefits shall also be provided
				for items and services in such category furnished outside any network of
				providers established or recognized under such plan or coverage in accordance
				with the requirements of this section.
								(ii)Categories of
				items and servicesFor
				purposes of clause (i), there shall be the following three categories of items
				and services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical
				benefits and all mental health and substance-related disorder benefits shall be
				classified into one of the following categories:
									(I)EmergencyItems
				and services, whether furnished on an inpatient or outpatient basis, required
				for the treatment of an emergency medical condition (as defined in section
				1867(e) of the Social Security Act,

We are at location: null   Compared with location: bill[1]/legis-body[1]/division[2]
The reason of change is: insertion
The value is expected to be: null But actually it is: division
 Inserted paragraph content is: {"BGenetic
			 Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008
			100.Short title;
			 findings
				(a)Short
			 titleThis division may be cited as the
			 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.
				(b)FindingsCongress
			 makes the following findings:
					(1)Deciphering the
			 sequence of the human genome and other advances in genetics open major new
			 opportunities for medical progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of
			 illness will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms
			 have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps to reduce the
			 likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. New knowledge about
			 genetics may allow for the development of better therapies that are more
			 effective against disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments.
			 These advances give rise to the potential misuse of genetic information to
			 discriminate in health insurance and employment.
					(2)The early science
			 of genetics became the basis of State laws that provided for the sterilization
			 of persons having presumed genetic defects such as mental
			 retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other
			 conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State of Indiana in
			 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted sterilization laws to
			 correct apparent genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these
			 State laws have since been repealed, and many have been modified to include
			 essential constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.
			 However, the current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of
			 sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, compels
			 Congressional action in this area.
					(3)Although genes are
			 facially neutral markers, many genetic conditions and disorders are associated
			 with particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some genetic
			 traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular group
			 may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of that genetic
			 information. This form of discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw
			 the advent of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a
			 disease which afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began
			 to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s began
			 mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia,
			 leading to discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this
			 stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act,
			 which withholds Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is
			 voluntary.
					(4)Congress has been
			 informed of examples of genetic discrimination in the workplace. These include
			 the use of pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
			 which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that case
			 Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir.
			 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the fear
			 of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice in employment and
			 health insurance.
					(5)Federal law
			 addressing genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment is
			 incomplete in both the scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many
			 States have enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws
			 vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and level of
			 protection. Congress has collected substantial evidence that the American
			 public and the medical community find the existing patchwork of State and
			 Federal laws to be confusing and inadequate to protect them from
			 discrimination. Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and
			 uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from
			 discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination,
			 thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing,
			 technologies, research, and new therapies.

						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services, the plan or coverage may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that are more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
							(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following four categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis and
				within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an inpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient basis
				and within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an outpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or coverage.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified under paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not
				impose such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category.
							(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services (as specified in paragraph
				(3)(C)), the plan or coverage shall apply such requirement (or, if there is
				more than one such requirement for such category of items and services, the
				predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and surgical
				benefits within such category and to mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits within such category and shall not distinguish in the
				application of such requirement between such medical and surgical benefits and
				such mental health and substance-related disorder benefits.
								(ii)Other
				financial requirementsIf the
				plan or coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in
				clause (i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category
				of items and services, the plan or coverage may not impose such financial
				requirement on mental health and substance-related disorder benefits for items
				and services within such category in a way that is more costly to the
				participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary financial
				requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing,
				and limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or
				beneficiary with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not
				include the application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services (specified in subparagraph (C)),
				the plan or coverage may not impose any treatment limit on mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits that are classified in the same category of
				items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that are more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
							(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following four categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis and
				within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an inpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient basis
				and within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services furnished on an outpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or coverage.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified in paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not impose
				such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits for items and services within such category.
							(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services, the plan or coverage shall
				apply such requirement (or, if there is more than one such requirement for such
				category of items and services, the predominant requirement for such category)
				both to medical and surgical benefits within such category and to mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits within such category and shall not
				distinguish in the application of such requirement between such medical and
				surgical benefits and such mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits.
								(ii)Other
				financial requirementsIf the
				plan or coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in
				clause (i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category
				of items and services, the plan or coverage may not impose such financial
				requirement on mental health and substance-related disorder benefits for items
				and services within such category in a way that is more costly to the
				participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary financial
				requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(C)Beneficiary

						(3)Treatment
				limitsIn the case of a group health plan that provides both
				medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits—
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan does not include a treatment limit (as defined
				in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any
				category of items or services (specified in subparagraph (C)), the plan may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan includes a treatment limit on substantially all
				medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or services, the plan
				may not impose such a treatment limit on mental health or substance-related
				disorder benefits for items and services within such category that is more
				restrictive than the predominant treatment limit that is applicable to medical
				and surgical benefits for items and services within such category.
							(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following five categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services not described in clause (v)
				furnished on an inpatient basis and within a network of providers established
				or recognized under such plan.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an inpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such
				plan.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services
				not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and within a
				network of providers established or recognized under such plan.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such
				plan.
								(v)Emergency
				CareItems and services,
				whether furnished on an inpatient or outpatient basis or within or outside any
				network of providers, required for the treatment of an emergency medical
				condition (including an emergency condition relating to mental health or
				substance-related disorders).
								(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan, limitation on the frequency of
				treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar limit on the
				duration or scope of treatment under the plan.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirementsIn the case of a group health plan that
				provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or
				substance-related disorder benefits—
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan does not include a beneficiary
				financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on substantially all
				medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and services
				(specified in paragraph (3)(C)), the plan may not impose such a beneficiary
				financial requirement on mental health or substance-related disorder benefits
				for items and services within such category.
							(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan
				includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or similar
				beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to individual
				items and services on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a
				category of items and services, the plan shall apply such requirement (or, if
				there is more than one such requirement for such category of items and
				services, the predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and
				surgical benefits within such category and to mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits within such category and shall not
				distinguish in the application of such requirement between such medical and
				surgical benefits and such mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits.
								(ii)Other
				financial requirementsIf the
				plan includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause (i)
				on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items
				and services, the plan may not impose such financial requirement on mental
				health or substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category in a way that results in greater out-of-pocket expenses to the
				participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary financial
				requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(iii)ConstructionNothing in this subparagraph shall be
				construed as prohibiting the plan from waiving the application of any
				deductible for mental health benefits or substance-related disorder benefits or
				both.
								(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing, and
				limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or beneficiary
				with respect to benefits under the plan, but does not include the application
				of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

			102.Amendments to the
			 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
				(a)Extension of
			 parity to treatment limits and beneficiary financial
			 requirementsSection 712 of the Employee Retirement Income
			 Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1185a) is amended—
					(1)in subsection (a),
			 by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
						
							(3)Treatment
				limitsIn the case of a group
				health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health
				or substance-related disorder benefits—
								(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services, the plan or coverage may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
								(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health or substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that is more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
								(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following five categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
									(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services not described in clause (v)
				furnished on an inpatient basis and within a network of providers established
				or recognized under such plan or coverage.
									(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an inpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
									(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services
				not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and within a
				network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
									(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and
				services not described in clause (v) furnished on an outpatient basis and
				outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
									(v)Emergency
				careItems and services, whether furnished on an inpatient or
				outpatient basis or within or outside any network of providers, required for
				the treatment of an emergency medical condition (as defined in section 1867(e)
				of the Social Security Act, including
				an emergency condition relating to mental health or substance-related
				disorders).
									(D)Treatment limit
				definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term treatment
				limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or coverage.
								(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
								(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirementsIn the
				case of a group health plan that provides both medical and surgical benefits
				and mental health or substance-related disorder benefits—
								(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified under paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not
				impose such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health or
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category.
								(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
									(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a deductible, a limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or
				similar beneficiary financial requirement that does not apply separately to
				individual items and services on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits within a category of items and services (as specified in paragraph
				(3)(C)), the plan or coverage shall apply such requirement (or, if there is
				more than one such requirement for such category of items and services, the
				predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and surgical
				benefits within such category and to mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits within such category and shall not distinguish in the
				application of such requirement between such medical and surgical benefits and
				such mental health and substance-related disorder benefits.
									(ii)Other financial
				requirementsIf the plan or
				coverage includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause
				(i) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of
				items and services, the plan or coverage may not impose such financial
				requirement on mental health or substance-related disorder benefits for items
				and services within such category in a way that results in greater
				out-of-pocket expenses to the participant or beneficiary than the predominant
				beneficiary financial requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits
				for items and services within such category.
									(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing,
				and limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or
				beneficiary with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not
				include the application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

			 paragraph:

				plan informationThe criteria
				for medical necessity determinations made under the plan with respect to mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits (or the health insurance
				coverage offered in connection with the plan with respect to such benefits)
				shall be made available by the plan administrator (or the health insurance
				issuer offering such coverage) in accordance with regulations to any current or
				potential participant, beneficiary, or contracting provider upon request. The
				reason for any denial under the plan (or coverage) of reimbursement or payment
				for services with respect to mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits in the case of any participant or beneficiary shall, on request or as
				otherwise required, be made available by the plan administrator (or the health
				insurance issuer offering such coverage) to the participant or beneficiary in
				accordance with
				regulations.
						.
				(d)Minimum benefit
			 requirementsSubsection (a) of such section is further amended by
			 adding at the end the following new paragraph:
					
						(6)Minimum scope of
				coverage and equity in out-of-network benefits
							(A)Minimum scope of
				mental health and substance-related disorder benefitsIn the case of a group health plan (or
				health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides
				any mental health or substance-related disorder benefits, the plan or coverage
				shall include benefits for any mental health condition or substance-related
				disorder included in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
				Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric
				Association.
							(B)Equity in
				coverage of out-of-network benefits
								(i)In
				generalIn the case of a plan or coverage that provides both
				medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance-related disorder
				benefits, if medical and surgical benefits are provided for substantially all
				items and services in a category specified in clause (ii) furnished outside any
				network of providers established or recognized under such plan or coverage, the
				mental health and substance-related disorder benefits shall also be provided
				for items and services in such category furnished outside any network of
				providers established or recognized under such plan or coverage in accordance
				with the requirements of this section.
								(ii)Categories of
				items and servicesFor
				purposes of clause (i), there shall be the following three categories of items
				and services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical
				benefits and all mental health and substance-related disorder benefits shall be
				classified into one of the following categories:
									(I)EmergencyItems
				and services, whether furnished on an inpatient or outpatient basis, required
				for the treatment of an emergency medical condition (as defined in section
				1867(e) of the Social Security Act,
				including an emergency condition relating to mental health or substance-related
				disorders).
									(II)InpatientItems

			 section is amended to read as follows:
					
						(2)Increased cost
				exemption
							(A)In
				generalWith respect to a
				group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such
				a plan), if the application of this section to such plan (or coverage) results
				in an increase for the plan year involved of the actual total costs of coverage
				with respect to medical and surgical benefits and mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits under the plan (as determined and certified
				under subparagraph (C)) by an amount that exceeds the applicable percentage
				described in subparagraph (B) of the actual total plan costs, the provisions of
				this section shall not apply to such plan (or coverage) during the following
				plan year, and such exemption shall apply to the plan (or coverage) for 1 plan
				year.
							(B)Applicable
				percentageWith respect to a plan (or coverage), the applicable

We are at location: null   Compared with location: bill[1]/legis-body[1]/division[2]
The reason of change is: insertion
The value is expected to be: null But actually it is: division
 Inserted paragraph content is: {"BGenetic
			 Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008
			100.Short title;
			 findings
				(a)Short
			 titleThis division may be cited as the
			 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.
				(b)FindingsCongress
			 makes the following findings:
					(1)Deciphering the
			 sequence of the human genome and other advances in genetics open major new
			 opportunities for medical progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of
			 illness will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms
			 have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps to reduce the
			 likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. New knowledge about
			 genetics may allow for the development of better therapies that are more
			 effective against disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments.
			 These advances give rise to the potential misuse of genetic information to
			 discriminate in health insurance and employment.
					(2)The early science
			 of genetics became the basis of State laws that provided for the sterilization
			 of persons having presumed genetic defects such as mental
			 retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other
			 conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State of Indiana in
			 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted sterilization laws to
			 correct apparent genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these
			 State laws have since been repealed, and many have been modified to include
			 essential constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.
			 However, the current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of
			 sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, compels
			 Congressional action in this area.
					(3)Although genes are
			 facially neutral markers, many genetic conditions and disorders are associated
			 with particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some genetic
			 traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular group
			 may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of that genetic
			 information. This form of discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw
			 the advent of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a
			 disease which afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began
			 to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s began
			 mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia,
			 leading to discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this
			 stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act,
			 which withholds Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is
			 voluntary.
					(4)Congress has been
			 informed of examples of genetic discrimination in the workplace. These include
			 the use of pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
			 which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that case
			 Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir.
			 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the fear
			 of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice in employment and
			 health insurance.
					(5)Federal law
			 addressing genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment is
			 incomplete in both the scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many
			 States have enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws
			 vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and level of
			 protection. Congress has collected substantial evidence that the American
			 public and the medical community find the existing patchwork of State and
			 Federal laws to be confusing and inadequate to protect them from
			 discrimination. Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and
			 uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from
			 discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination,
			 thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing,
			 technologies, research, and new therapies.

						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services, the plan or coverage may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health and substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that are more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
							(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following four categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis and
				within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis
				and outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan
				or coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient basis
				and within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient
				basis and outside any network of providers established or recognized under such
				plan or coverage.
								(D)Treatment
				limit definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term
				treatment limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage,
				limitation on the frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage,
				or other similar limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or
				coverage.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified under paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not
				impose such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category.
							(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or coverage includes a deductible, a
				limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or similar beneficiary financial
				requirement that does not apply separately to individual items and services on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (as specified in paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage shall apply
				such requirement (or, if there is more than one such requirement for such
				category of items and services, the predominant requirement for such category)
				both to medical and surgical benefits within such category and to mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits within such category and shall not
				distinguish in the application of such requirement between such medical and
				surgical benefits and such mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits.
								(ii)Other
				financial requirementsIf the plan or coverage includes a
				beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause (i) on substantially
				all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and services, the
				plan or coverage may not impose such financial requirement on mental health and
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such category
				in a way that is more costly to the participant or beneficiary than the
				predominant beneficiary financial requirement applicable to medical and
				surgical benefits for items and services within such category.
								(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing,
				and limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or
				beneficiary with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not
				include the application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage does not include a treatment limit
				(as defined in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical
				benefits in any category of items or services (specified in subparagraph (C)),
				the plan or coverage may not impose any treatment limit on mental health or
				substance-related disorder benefits that are classified in the same category of
				items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan or coverage includes a treatment limit on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or
				services, the plan or coverage may not impose such a treatment limit on mental
				health or substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within
				such category that is more restrictive than the predominant treatment limit
				that is applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.
							(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following five categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services not described in clause (v)
				furnished on an inpatient basis and within a network of providers established
				or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and services not described in clause (v)
				furnished on an inpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services not described in clause (v)
				furnished on an outpatient basis and within a network of providers established
				or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and services not described in clause (v)
				furnished on an outpatient basis and outside any network of providers
				established or recognized under such plan or coverage.
								(v)Emergency
				careItems and services, whether furnished on an inpatient or
				outpatient basis or within or outside any network of providers, required for
				the treatment of an emergency medical condition (as defined in section 1867(e)
				of the Social Security Act, including
				an emergency condition relating to mental health and substance-related
				disorders).
								(D)Treatment
				limit definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term
				treatment limit means, with respect to a plan or coverage,
				limitation on the frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage,
				or other similar limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan or
				coverage.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan or coverage does not include a
				beneficiary financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services (specified in paragraph (3)(C)), the plan or coverage may not impose
				such a beneficiary financial requirement on mental health or substance-related
				disorder benefits for items and services within such category.
							(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or coverage includes a deductible, a
				limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or similar beneficiary financial
				requirement that does not apply separately to individual items and services on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services, the plan or coverage shall apply such requirement (or, if there is
				more than one such requirement for such category of items and services, the
				predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and surgical
				benefits within such category and to mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits within such category and shall not distinguish in the
				application of such requirement between such medical and surgical benefits and
				such mental health and substance-related disorder benefits.
								(ii)Other
				financial requirementsIf the plan or coverage includes a
				beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause (i) on substantially
				all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and services, the
				plan or coverage may not impose such financial requirement on mental health or
				substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such category
				in a way that is more costly to the participant or beneficiary than the
				predominant beneficiary financial requirement applicable to medical and
				surgical benefits for items and services within such category.
								(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing,
				and limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or
				beneficiary with respect to benefits under the plan or coverage, but does not
				include the application of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

						(3)Treatment
				limits
							(A)No treatment
				limitIf the plan does not include a treatment limit (as defined
				in subparagraph (D)) on substantially all medical and surgical benefits in any
				category of items or services (specified in subparagraph (C)), the plan may not
				impose any treatment limit on mental health and substance-related disorder
				benefits that are classified in the same category of items or services.
							(B)Treatment
				limitIf the plan includes a treatment limit on substantially all
				medical and surgical benefits in any category of items or services, the plan
				may not impose such a treatment limit on mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits for items and services within such category that are more
				restrictive than the predominant treatment limit that is applicable to medical
				and surgical benefits for items and services within such category.
							(C)Categories of
				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following four categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health
				and substance-related disorder benefits, and all medical and surgical benefits
				and all mental health and substance related benefits shall be classified into
				one of the following categories:
								(i)Inpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis and
				within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(ii)Inpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and services furnished on an inpatient basis
				and outside any network of providers established or recognized under such plan
				or coverage.
								(iii)Outpatient,
				in-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient basis
				and within a network of providers established or recognized under such plan or
				coverage.
								(iv)Outpatient,
				out-of-networkItems and services furnished on an outpatient
				basis and outside any network of providers established or recognized under such
				plan or coverage.
								(D)Treatment
				limit definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the term
				treatment limit means, with respect to a plan, limitation on the
				frequency of treatment, number of visits or days of coverage, or other similar
				limit on the duration or scope of treatment under the plan.
							(E)PredominanceFor
				purposes of this subsection, a treatment limit or financial requirement with
				respect to a category of items and services is considered to be predominant if
				it is the most common or frequent of such type of limit or requirement with
				respect to such category of items and services.
							(4)Beneficiary
				financial requirements
							(A)No beneficiary
				financial requirementIf the plan does not include a beneficiary
				financial requirement (as defined in subparagraph (C)) on substantially all
				medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and services
				(specified in paragraph (3)(C)), the plan may not impose such a beneficiary
				financial requirement on mental health and substance-related disorder benefits
				for items and services within such category.
							(B)Beneficiary
				financial requirement
								(i)Treatment of
				deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and similar financial
				requirementsIf the plan or coverage includes a deductible, a
				limitation on out-of-pocket expenses, or similar beneficiary financial
				requirement that does not apply separately to individual items and services on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services, the plan or coverage shall apply such requirement (or, if there is
				more than one such requirement for such category of items and services, the
				predominant requirement for such category) both to medical and surgical
				benefits within such category and to mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits within such category and shall not distinguish in the
				application of such requirement between such medical and surgical benefits and
				such mental health and substance-related disorder benefits.
								(ii)Other
				financial requirementsIf the plan includes a beneficiary
				financial requirement not described in clause (i) on substantially all medical
				and surgical benefits within a category of items and services, the plan may not
				impose such financial requirement on mental health and substance-related
				disorder benefits for items and services within such category in a way that is
				more costly to the participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary
				financial requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and
				services within such category.
								(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing, and
				limitation on the total amount that may be paid by a participant or beneficiary
				with respect to benefits under the plan, but does not include the application
				of any aggregate lifetime limit or annual
				limit.

				out-of-pocket expenses to the participant or beneficiary than the predominant
				beneficiary financial requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits
				for items and services within such category.
									(C)Beneficiary
				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan or coverage, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing,

				items and services for application of treatment limits and beneficiary
				financial requirementsFor purposes of this paragraph and
				paragraph (4), there shall be the following five categories of items and
				services for benefits, whether medical and surgical benefits or mental health

				benefits.

				requirementsIf the plan
				includes a beneficiary financial requirement not described in clause (i) on
				substantially all medical and surgical benefits within a category of items and
				services, the plan may not impose such financial requirement on mental health
				or substance-related disorder benefits for items and services within such
				category in a way that results in greater out-of-pocket expenses to the
				participant or beneficiary than the predominant beneficiary financial
				requirement applicable to medical and surgical benefits for items and services
				within such category.

				financial requirement definedFor purposes of this paragraph, the
				term beneficiary financial requirement includes, with respect to a
				plan, any deductible, coinsurance, co-payment, other cost sharing, and

 Inserted paragraph content is: {"BGenetic
			 Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008
			100.Short title;
			 findings
				(a)Short
			 titleThis division may be cited as the
			 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.
				(b)FindingsCongress
			 makes the following findings:
					(1)Deciphering the
			 sequence of the human genome and other advances in genetics open major new
			 opportunities for medical progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of
			 illness will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms
			 have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps to reduce the
			 likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. New knowledge about
			 genetics may allow for the development of better therapies that are more
			 effective against disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments.
			 These advances give rise to the potential misuse of genetic information to
			 discriminate in health insurance and employment.
					(2)The early science
			 of genetics became the basis of State laws that provided for the sterilization
			 of persons having presumed genetic defects such as mental
			 retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other
			 conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State of Indiana in
			 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted sterilization laws to
			 correct apparent genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these
			 State laws have since been repealed, and many have been modified to include
			 essential constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.
			 However, the current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of
			 sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, compels
			 Congressional action in this area.
					(3)Although genes are
			 facially neutral markers, many genetic conditions and disorders are associated
			 with particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some genetic
			 traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular group
			 may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of that genetic
			 information. This form of discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw
			 the advent of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a
			 disease which afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began
			 to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s began
			 mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia,
			 leading to discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this
			 stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act,
			 which withholds Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is
			 voluntary.
					(4)Congress has been
			 informed of examples of genetic discrimination in the workplace. These include
			 the use of pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
			 which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that case
			 Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir.
			 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the fear
			 of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice in employment and
			 health insurance.
					(5)Federal law
			 addressing genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment is
			 incomplete in both the scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many
			 States have enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws
			 vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and level of
			 protection. Congress has collected substantial evidence that the American
			 public and the medical community find the existing patchwork of State and
			 Federal laws to be confusing and inadequate to protect them from
			 discrimination. Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and
			 uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from
			 discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination,
			 thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing,
			 technologies, research, and new therapies.
