			 purposes
			(a)FindingsCongress
			 finds that—
				(1)in enacting the
			 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Congress intended that the Act
			 provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination
			 of discrimination against individuals with disabilities and provide
			 broad coverage;
				(2)in enacting the
			 ADA, Congress recognized that physical and mental disabilities in no way
			 diminish a person’s right to fully participate in all aspects of society, but
			 that people with physical or mental disabilities are frequently precluded from
			 doing so because of prejudice, antiquated attitudes, or the failure to remove
			 societal and institutional barriers;
				(3)while Congress
			 expected that the definition of disability under the ADA would be interpreted
			 consistently with how courts had applied the definition of handicap under the
			 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that expectation has not been fulfilled;
				(4)the holdings of
			 the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and
			 its companion cases, and in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v.
			 Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) have narrowed the broad scope of protection
			 intended to be afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many
			 individuals whom Congress intended to protect; and
				(5)as a result of
			 these Supreme Court cases, lower courts have incorrectly found in individual
			 cases that people with a range of substantially limiting impairments are not
			 people with disabilities.
				(b)PurposesThe
			 purposes of this Act are—
				(1)to carry out the
			 ADA’s objectives of providing a clear and comprehensive national mandate
			 for the elimination of discrimination and clear, strong,
			 consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination by
			 reinstating a broad scope of protection to be available under the ADA;
				(2)to reject the
			 requirement enunciated by the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc.,
			 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases that whether an impairment
			 substantially limits a major life activity is to be determined with reference
			 to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures;
				(3)to reject the
			 Supreme Court’s reasoning in Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471
			 (1999) with regard to coverage under the third prong of the definition of
			 disability and to reinstate the reasoning of the Supreme Court in School Board
			 of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987) which set forth a broad view of
			 the third prong of the definition of handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of
			 1973;
				(4)to reject the
			 standards enunciated by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing,
			 Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms
			 substantially and major in the definition of
			 disability under the ADA need to be interpreted strictly to create a
			 demanding standard for qualifying as disabled, and that to be
			 substantially limited in performing a major life activity under the ADA
			 an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely
			 restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance
			 to most people’s daily lives; and
				(5)to provide a new
			 definition of substantially limits to indicate that Congress
			 intends to depart from the strict and demanding standard applied by the Supreme
			 Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams and by numerous
			 lower courts.

			(a)Definition of
			 disabilitySection 3 of the
			 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended to read as
			 follows:
				
					3.Definition of
				disabilityAs used in this
				Act:
						(1)DisabilityThe
				term disability means, with respect to an individual—
							(A)a physical or
				mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities
				of such individual;
							(B)a record of such
				an impairment; or
							(C)being regarded as
				having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (4)).
							(2)Substantially
				limitsThe term substantially limits means
				materially restricts.
						(3)Major life
				activities
							(A)In
				generalFor purposes of paragraph (1), major life activities
				include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks,
				seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending,
				speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating
				and working.
							(B)Major bodily
				functionsFor purposes of
				paragraph (1), a major life activity also includes the operation of a major
				bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system,
				normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain,
				respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.
							(4)Regarded as
				having such an impairmentFor purposes of paragraph
				(1)(C):
							(A)An individual
				meets the requirement of being regarded as having such an
				impairment if the individual establishes that he or she has been
				subjected to an action prohibited under this Act because of an actual or
				perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or
				is perceived to limit a major life activity.
							(B)Paragraph (1)(C) shall not apply to
				impairments that are transitory and minor. A transitory impairment is an
				impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less.
							(5)Rules of
				construction regarding the definition of disabilityThe definition of disability
				in paragraph (1) shall be construed in accordance with the following:
							(A)To achieve the remedial purposes of this
				Act, the definition of disability in paragraph (1) shall be
				construed broadly.
							(B)An impairment
				that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major
				life activities in order to be considered a disability.
							(C)An impairment
				that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially
				limit a major life activity when active.
							(D)(i)The determination of
				whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made
				without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures such
				as—
									(I)medication,
				medical supplies, equipment, or appliances, low-vision devices (which do not
				include ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses), prosthetics including limbs and
				devices, hearing aids and cochlear implants or other implantable hearing
				devices, mobility devices, or oxygen therapy equipment and supplies;
									(II)use of assistive
				technology;
									(III)reasonable
				accommodations or auxiliary aids or services; or
									(IV)learned
				behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications.
									(ii)The ameliorative
				effects of the mitigating measures of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses
				shall be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a
				major life activity.
								(iii)As used in this
				subparagraph—
									(I)the term
				ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses means lenses that are
				intended to fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error;
				and
									(II)the term
				low-vision devices means devices that magnify, enhance, or
				otherwise augment a visual
				image.
									.
			(b)Conforming
			 amendmentThe Americans with
			 Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) is further amended by adding
			 after section 3 the following:
				
					4.Additional
				definitionsAs used in this
				Act:

				and servicesThe term auxiliary aids and services
				includes—
							(A)qualified
				interpreters or other effective methods of making aurally delivered materials
				available to individuals with hearing impairments;
							(B)qualified
				readers, taped texts, or other effective methods of making visually delivered
				materials available to individuals with visual impairments;
							(C)acquisition or
				modification of equipment or devices; and
							(D)other similar
				services and actions.
							(2)StateThe
				term State means each of the several States, the District of
				Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin
				Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Commonwealth of
				the Northern Mariana
				Islands.
