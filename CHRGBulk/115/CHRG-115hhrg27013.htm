    Chairman Royce. So before placing my prepared statement 
into the record I want to briefly highlight one measure here. 
H.R. 3329, which amends and strengthens the Hizballah 
International Financing Prevention Act, which was signed into 
law last Congress. In recent weeks we have seen alarming 
reports that Hizballah and Iran are building illicit missile 
factories on Israel's doorstep. This, combined with a reported 
fourfold increase in Iranian support to Hizballah, is pushing 
the region to the brink. We have got to further tighten the 
screws on these terrorists.
    In addition to the $800 million annual support funding that 
they receive from Tehran, Hizballah continues to make millions 
from its trafficking in cocaine and other narcotics and in 
illicit cigarettes. This bill pushes back against Hizballah's 
international financial network, against its Russian and Syrian 
enablers, and against its sponsor, Iran. And I want to thank 
Ranking Member Engel for working with me on this important 
measure.
    Without objection my full statement on all nine bills will 
be entered for the record, and I now recognize the ranking 
member, Mr. Engel.
    Mr. Engel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for calling 
this markup. I support all of the measures before us this 
morning, and I know we are on a tight schedule, so I am going 
ask that my statement in its entirety be entered into today's 
record.
    Chairman Royce. Without objection.
    Mr. Engel. Before I yield back I want to recognize 
Francisco Marquez, who is with us today, a former political 
prisoner of the Maduro Government in Venezuela. He is here to 
raise awareness about Congressman Wilmer Azuaje, another 
political prisoner. The Congressman has been tortured, 
isolated, and denied medical attention, as well as access to 
his lawyer and family. Mr. Marquez, we have heard your story 
and so many stories like it, and with the bill I introduce with 
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, the Venezuela 
Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance 
Act, we are providing humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan 
people and raising the alarm about political prisoners and the 
assault on the rule of law.
    I also thank Senator Cardin for first offering this 
legislation in the other body. So I will leave it there, but 
again, I am glad to support all nine measures today. Mr. 
Chairman, thank you as always for your leadership, and I yield 
back.
    Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Engel.
    Now, do any other members seek recognition?
    Judge Ted Poe.
    Mr. Poe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support all the 
legislation. I also support Mr. Castro's amendment to my bill, 
the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation bill, 
and especially appreciate Mr. Zeldin's legislation as well. And 
I ask that all my statements for all bills will be made part of 
the record.
    Chairman Royce. Without objection.
    Mr. Poe. I yield back.
    Chairman Royce. Mr. Schneider?
    Mr. Schneider. Thank you. And likewise, I commend the 
committee for bringing this legislation to markup. I support 
this legislation. I have an amendment to the Hizballah 
Amendments Act, and I appreciate the support for that, and I 
will submit my statement to the record.
    Thank you very much.
    Chairman Royce. Thank you. Mr. Schneider. Mr. Wilson?
    Mr. Wilson. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you and 
also the ranking member, Eliot Engel, for the legislation that 
we have today, and I have prepared a statement in support, 
which I have offered for the record.
    Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Sires?
    Mr. Sires. I would also like to say thank you to you and 
the ranking member for all the hard work. I certainly support 
all the bills that are here today, and thank you very much. And 
for the sake of time--I appreciate it.
    Chairman Royce. Thank you very much, Mr. Sires.
    Hearing no further request for recognition the question 
occurs on the items considered en bloc.
    All those in favor say aye.
    All those opposed, no.
    In the opinion of the Chair the ayes have it, and the 
measures considered en bloc are agreed to. And without 
objection the measures considered en bloc are ordered favorably 
reported as amended.
    Staff is directed to make any technical and any conforming 
changes, and the Chair is hereby authorized to seek House 
consideration under suspension of the rules.
    And that concludes our business for today. I want to thank 
Ranking Member Engel and all of our committee members for their 
contributions and their assistance with today's markup.
    The committee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 10:10 a.m., the committee was adjourned.]
