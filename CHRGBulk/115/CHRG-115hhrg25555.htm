                        WEDNESDAY, MAY 24, 2017

                       House of Representatives,

                Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere,

                     Committee on Foreign Affairs,

                            Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:09 p.m., in 
room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen presiding.
    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. The subcommittee will come to order.
    Pursuant to notice, we meet today to mark up four 
bipartisan measures. As members were notified previously, to 
ensure that we can move expeditiously to our hearing, we will 
consider today's items en bloc.
    And so without objection, the following items provided to 
your offices earlier this week will be considered en bloc and 
are considered as read: House Resolution 201, Expressing 
support for the Government of Argentina for its investigation 
into the terrorist bombings of the Embassy of Israel in Buenos 
Aires on March 17, 1992; Smith amendment, which was worked out 
between majority and minority staff last night and this 
morning; House Resolution 259, Expressing concern and 
condemnation over the political, economic, social, and 
humanitarian crisis in Venezuela; the Duncan amendment in the 
nature of a substitute to H.R. 259; the Castro amendment--that 
is the good Castro--19 to the ANS; the Torres amendment 29 to 
the ANS; House Resolution 336, Reaffirming a strong commitment 
to the United States-Mexico partnership; H.R. 1918, the 
Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act of 2017; and Ros-
Lehtinen amendment 23 to H.R. 1918.
    [The information referred to follows:]

    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Without objection, all members may have 5 
days to submit statements and materials for the record.
    In the interest of time, I plan to submit my remarks and 
Mr. Duncan's remarks for the Congressional Record. I encourage 
other members to submit their remarks for the Congressional 
Record as well.
    And I want to applaud the leadership and help of all of our 
congressional subcommittee in bringing attention to all of 
these terrible situations throughout the world.
    And with that, I would like to turn to Mr. Duncan's ranking 
member, Mr. Sires.
    Mr. Sires. I have no comments. I agree.
    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you very much.
    As you know, we have a series of votes on the floor, five 
votes. And so I will turn now to the page that does it legally.
    Do any other members seek recognition to speak on today's 
business?
    Seeing no members, the Chair now moves that the 
subcommittee favorably report the items considered en bloc to 
the full committee as amended.
    All those in favor, say aye.
    All those opposed, no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. The motion 
is approved. House resolution 201, 259, 336, and H.R. 1918 are 
reported favorably to the full committee as amended.
    Without objection, staff is directed to make any technical 
or conforming changes.
    As you know, all of the members and the staff have been 
working for 2 weeks now on this markup, so don't think that 
they haven't been read and studied.
    The chairman wants to thank all of the members and staff 
for their assistance and cooperation on today's markup. And the 
subcommittee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 1:12 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
