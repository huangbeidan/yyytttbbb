        adjustment, as appropriate, in the base acres for covered 
        commodities for a farm whenever any of the following 
        circumstances occur:
                    (A) A conservation reserve contract entered into 
                under section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16

                of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (7 
                U.S.C. 8711(a)(1)(D)).
            (2) Special conservation reserve acreage payment rules.--
        For the crop year in which a base acres adjustment under 
        subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) is first made, the 
        owner of the farm shall elect to receive price loss coverage or 
        agriculture risk coverage with respect to the acreage added to 
        the farm under this subsection or a prorated payment under the 
        conservation reserve contract, but not both.
    (b) Prevention of Excess Base Acres.--
            (1) Required reduction.--If the sum of the base acres for a 
        farm and the acreage described in paragraph (2) exceeds the 
        actual cropland acreage of the farm, the Secretary shall reduce 
        the base acres for 1 or more covered commodities for the farm 
        so that the sum of the base acres and the acreage described in 
        paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual cropland acreage of 
        the farm.
            (2) Other acreage.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
        Secretary shall include the following:
                    (A) Any acreage on the farm enrolled in the 
                conservation reserve program or wetlands reserve 
                program (or successor programs) under title XII of the 
                Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.).
                    (B) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a 
                Federal conservation program for which payments are 
                made in exchange for not producing an agricultural 
                commodity on the acreage.
                    (C) If the Secretary designates additional 
                oilseeds, any eligible oilseed acreage, which shall be 
                determined in the same manner as eligible oilseed 
                acreage under subsection (a)(1)(C).
            (3) Selection of acres.--The Secretary shall give the owner 
        of the farm the opportunity to select the base acres for a 
        covered commodity for the farm against which the reduction 
        required by paragraph (1) will be made.
            (4) Exception for double-cropped acreage.--In applying 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make an exception in the

                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall 
                proportionately reduce base acres on a farm for land 
                that has been subdivided and developed for multiple 
                residential units or other nonfarming uses if the size 
                of the tracts and the density of the subdivision is 
                such that the land is unlikely to return to the 
                previous agricultural use, unless the producers on the 
                farm demonstrate that the land--
                            (i) remains devoted to commercial 
                        agricultural production; or
                            (ii) is likely to be returned to the 
                        previous agricultural use.
                    (B) Requirement.--The Secretary shall establish 
                procedures to identify land described in subparagraph 
                (A).
            (3) Treatment of unplanted base.--In the case of a farm on 
        which no covered commodities (including seed cotton) were 
        planted or prevented from being planted during the period 
        beginning on January 1, 2009, and ending on December 31, 2017, 
        the Secretary shall allocate all base acres on the farm to 
        unassigned crop base for which no payment shall be made under 
        section 1116 or 1117.
            (4) Prohibition on reconstitution of farm.--The Secretary 
        shall ensure that producers on a farm do not reconstitute the 
        farm to void or change the treatment of base acres under this 
        section.

SEC. 1113. PAYMENT YIELDS.

    (a) Treatment of Designated Oilseeds.--
            (1) In general.--For the purpose of making price loss 
        coverage payments under section 1116, the Secretary shall 
        provide for the establishment of a yield for each farm for any 
        designated oilseed for which a payment yield was not 
        established under section 1113 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 
        (7 U.S.C. 9013) in accordance with this section.
            (2) Payment yields for designated oilseeds.--In the case of 
        designated oilseeds, the payment yield shall be equal to 90 
        percent of the average of the yield per planted acre for the 
        most recent five crop years, as determined by the Secretary, 
        excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the 
        covered commodity was zero.
            (3) Application.--This subsection shall apply to oilseeds 
        designated after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (b) Effect of Lack of Payment Yield.--
            (1) Establishment by secretary.--In the case of a covered 
        commodity on a farm for which base acres have been established, 
        if no payment yield is otherwise established for the covered 
        commodity on the farm, the Secretary shall establish an 
        appropriate payment yield for the covered commodity on the farm 
        under paragraph (2).
            (2) Use of similarly situated farms.--To establish an 
        appropriate payment yield for a covered commodity on a farm as 
        required by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take into 
        consideration the farm program payment yields applicable to 
        that covered commodity for similarly situated farms. The use of 
        such data in an appeal, by the Secretary or by the producer, 
        shall not be subject to any other provision of law.
    (c) Single Opportunity to Update Yields in Counties Affected by 
Drought.--
            (1) Election to update.--In the case of a farm that is 
        physically located in a county in which any area of the county 
        was rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having a D4 
        (exceptional drought) intensity for 20 or more consecutive 
        weeks during the period beginning January 1, 2008 and ending 
        December 31, 2012, at the sole discretion of the owner of such 
        farm, the owner of a farm shall have a 1-time opportunity to 
        update, on a covered commodity-by covered-commodity basis, the 
        payment yield that would otherwise be used in calculating any 
        price loss coverage payment for each covered commodity on the 
        farm for which the election is made.
            (2) Method of updating yields for covered commodities.--If 
        the owner of a farm elects to update yields under paragraph 
        (1), the payment yield for covered commodities on the farm, for 
        the purpose of calculating price loss coverage payments only, 
        shall be equal to 90 percent of the average of the yield per 
        planted acre for the crop of covered commodities on the farm 
        for the 2013 through 2017 crop years, as determined by the 
        Secretary, excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted 
        to the covered commodity was zero.
            (3) Use of county average yield.--For the purposes of 
        determining the average yield under paragraph (2), if the yield 
        per planted acre for a crop of a covered commodity for a farm 
        for any of the crop years specified in paragraph (2) was less 
        than 75 percent of the average of county yields for those same 
        years for that commodity, the Secretary shall assign a yield 
        for that crop year equal to 75 percent of the average of the 
        2013 though 2017 county yield for the covered commodity.
            (4) Upland cotton conversion.--In the case of seed cotton, 
        for purposes of determining the average of the yield per 
        planted acre under paragraph (2), the average yield for seed 
        cotton per planted acre shall be equal to 2.4 times the average 
        yield for upland cotton per planted acre.
            (5) Time for election.--An election under this subsection 
        shall be made at a time and manner so as to be in effect 
        beginning with the 2019 crop year, as determined by the 
        Secretary.

SEC. 1114. PAYMENT ACRES.

    (a) Determination of Payment Acres.--Subject to subsection (d), for 
the purpose of price loss coverage and agriculture risk coverage, the 
payment acres for each covered commodity on a farm shall be equal to 85 
percent of the base acres for the covered commodity on the farm.
    (b) Effect of Minimal Payment Acres.--
            (1) Prohibition on payments.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of this title, a producer on a farm may not receive 
        price loss coverage payments or agriculture risk coverage 
        payments if the sum of the base acres on the farm is 10 acres 
        or less, as determined by the Secretary, unless the sum of the 
        base acres on the farm, when combined with the base acres of 
        other farms in which the producer has an interest, is more than 
        10 acres.
            (2) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) does not apply to a producer 
        that is--
                    (A) a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher (as 
                defined in section 355(e) of the Consolidated Farm and 
                Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2003(e))); or

                defined by the Secretary.
    (c) Effect of Planting Fruits and Vegetables.--
            (1) Reduction required.--In the manner provided in this 
        subsection, payment acres on a farm shall be reduced in any 
        crop year in which fruits, vegetables (other than mung beans 
        and pulse crops), or wild rice have been planted on base acres 
        on a farm.
            (2) Price loss coverage and agricultural risk coverage.--In 
        the case of price loss coverage payments and agricultural risk 
        coverage payments, the reduction under paragraph (1) shall be 
        the amount equal to the base acres planted to crops referred to 
        in such paragraph in excess of 15 percent of base acres.
            (3) Reduction exceptions.--No reduction to payment acres 
        shall be made under this subsection if--
                    (A) cover crops or crops referred to in paragraph 
                (1) are grown solely for conservation purposes and not 
                harvested for use or sale, as determined by the 
                Secretary; or
                    (B) in any region in which there is a history of 
                double-cropping covered commodities with crops referred 
                to in paragraph (1) and such crops were so double-
                cropped on the base acres, as determined by the 
                Secretary.
            (4) Effect of reduction.--For each crop year for which 
        fruits, vegetables (other than mung beans and pulse crops), or 
        wild rice are planted to base acres on a farm for which a 
        reduction in payment acres is made under this subsection, the 
        Secretary shall consider such base acres to be planted, or 
        prevented from planting, to a covered commodity for purposes of 
        any adjustment or reduction of base acres for the farm under 
        section 1112.
    (d) Unassigned Crop Base.--The Secretary shall maintain information 
on base acres allocated as unassigned crop base pursuant to--
            (1) section 1112(c)(3); or
            (2) section 1112(a) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 
        U.S.C. 9012(a)).

SEC. 1115. PRODUCER ELECTION.

    (a) Election Required.--For the 2019 through 2023 crop years, all 
of the producers on a farm shall make a 1-time, irrevocable election to

        to the farm for the 2019 crop year under section 1116 or 1117; 
        and
            (2) the producers on the farm shall be deemed to have 
        elected price loss coverage under section 1116 for all covered 
        commodities on the farm for the 2020 through 2023 crop years.
    (c) Prohibition on Reconstitution.--The Secretary shall ensure that 
producers on a farm do not reconstitute the farm to void or change an 
election made under this section.

SEC. 1116. PRICE LOSS COVERAGE.

    (a) Price Loss Coverage Payments.--If all of the producers on a 
farm make the election under subsection (a) of section 1115 to obtain 
price loss coverage or, subject to subsection (b)(1) of such section, 
are deemed to have made such election under subsection (b)(2) of such 
section, the Secretary shall make price loss coverage payments to 
producers on the farm on a covered-commodity-by-covered-commodity basis 
if the Secretary determines that, for any of the 2019 through 2023 crop 
years--
            (1) the effective price for the covered commodity for the 
        crop year; is less than
            (2) the effective reference price for the covered commodity 
        for the crop year.
    (b) Effective Price.--The effective price for a covered commodity 
for a crop year shall be the higher of--

    (c) Payment Rate.--The payment rate shall be equal to the 
difference between--
            (1) the effective reference price for the covered 
        commodity; and
            (2) the effective price determined under subsection (b) for 
        the covered commodity.
    (d) Payment Amount.--If price loss coverage payments are required 
to be provided under this section for any of the 2019 through 2023 crop 
years for a covered commodity, the amount of the price loss coverage 
payment to be paid to the producers on a farm for the crop year shall 
be equal to the product obtained by multiplying--
            (1) the payment rate for the covered commodity under 
        subsection (c);
            (2) the payment yield for the covered commodity; and
            (3) the payment acres for the covered commodity determined 
        under section 1114.
    (e) Time for Payments.--If the Secretary determines under this 
section that price loss coverage payments are required to be provided 
for the covered commodity, the payments shall be made beginning October 
1, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the 
applicable marketing year for the covered commodity.
    (f) Effective Price for Barley.--In determining the effective price

SEC. 1117. AGRICULTURE RISK COVERAGE.

    (a) Agriculture Risk Coverage Payments.--If all of the producers on 
a farm make the election under section 1115(a) to obtain agriculture 
risk coverage, the Secretary shall make agriculture risk coverage 
payments to producers on the farm if the Secretary determines that, for 
any of the 2019 through 2023 crop years--
            (1) the actual crop revenue determined under subsection (b) 
        for the crop year; is less than
            (2) the agriculture risk coverage guarantee determined 
        under subsection (c) for the crop year.
    (b) Actual Crop Revenue.--The amount of the actual crop revenue for

    (c) Agriculture Risk Coverage Guarantee.--
            (1) In general.--The agriculture risk coverage guarantee 
        for a crop year for a covered commodity shall equal 86 percent 
        of the benchmark revenue.
            (2) Benchmark revenue.--The benchmark revenue shall be 
        equal to the product obtained by multiplying--
                    (A) subject to paragraph (3), the average 
                historical county yield as determined by the Secretary 
                for the most recent 5 crop years, excluding each of the 
                crop years with the highest and lowest yields; and

               Subtitle B--Agricultural Trade Act of 1978

SEC. 3101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) United States export development programs significantly 
        increase demand for United States agriculture products within 
        foreign markets, boosting agricultural export volume and 
        overall farm income, and generating a net return of $28 in 
        added export revenue for each invested program dollar.
            (2) Our global competitors provide substantially more 
        public support for export promotion than is provided to United 
        States agricultural exporters. The Market Access Program and 
        Foreign Market Development Program receive combined annual 
        funding of approximately $234,500,000. In comparison, the 
        European Union allocates $255,000,000 annually for the 
        international promotion of wine alone.
            (3) The preservation and streamlining of United States 
        export market development programs complements the recent 
        reorganization within the Department of Agriculture by ensuring 
        the newly established Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign 
        Agricultural Affairs has the tools necessary to enhance the 
        competitiveness of the United States agricultural industry on 
        the global stage.

                shall not make any lack of essentiality a criterion for 
                denying registration of any pesticide. Where two 
                pesticides meet the requirements of this paragraph, one 
                should not be registered in preference to the other. In

                pesticide, the Administrator may waive data 
                requirements pertaining to efficacy, in which event the 
                Administrator may register the pesticide without 
                determining that the pesticide's composition is such as 
                to warrant proposed claims of efficacy. If a pesticide 
                is found to be efficacious by any State under section 
                24(c), a presumption is established that the 
                Administrator shall waive data requirements pertaining 
                to efficacy for use of the pesticide in such State.''.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation

Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, shall prepare and 
submit a report to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry of the Senate on plans for improving the Federal government's 
policies and procedures with respect to gene editing and other 
precision plant breeding methods.
    (b) Content.--The report under subsection (a) shall include plans 
to implement measures designed to ensure that--
            (1) the United States continues to provide a favorable 
        environment for research and development in precision plant 
        breeding innovation and maintains its leadership with respect 
        to that innovation;
            (2) for plants for which premarket review is required under 
        the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7701 et seq.), the Federal 
        Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136), or 
        the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the process for such 
        review is designed--
                    (A) to minimize regulatory burden while assuring 
                protection of public health and welfare; and
                    (B) to ensure that resources of the Department of 
                Agriculture are focused on plants with less familiar 
                characteristics, more complex risk pathways, or both;
            (3) each agency referred to in subsection (a) recognizes 
        that certain applications of gene editing in plants do not 
        warrant such a premarket review process;
            (4) each agency referred to in subsection (a) clearly 
        communicates the rationale for the regulatory policies and 
        decisions of such agency to the public through broadly 
        available and easily accessible tools;
            (5) categories of plants that are familiar and have a 
        history of safe use be identified and exempted from such 
        premarket review or be subject to an expedited, independent 
        premarket review process for which data requirements are 
        reduced;
            (6) regulatory processes of each agency referred to in 
        subsection (a) are predictable, efficient, not duplicative, and 
        designed to accommodate rapid advances in plant breeding 
        technology; and
            (7) where Federal law provides for regulatory oversight of 
        plant breeding technology by more than one Federal agency, the 
        relevant Federal agencies enter into appropriate interagency 
        agreements to shift responsibility for particular categories of 
        plant products and regulatory activities for purposes of 
        meeting the goals specified in paragraphs (1) through (6).

            (2) The number of dogs so imported for resale.
            (3) The number of dogs for which such importation for 
        resale was requested but denied because such importation failed 
        to meet the requirements of section 18 of the Animal Welfare 
        Act (7 U.S.C. 2148).
            (4) The Secretary's recommendations for Federal statutory 
        changes determined to be necessary for such importation for 
        resale to meet the requirements of such section.

special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
    ``(d) Conflict With State Law.--This section shall not be construed 
to limit any State or local law or regulations protecting the welfare

stringent than this section.''.

State or unit of local government proves by clear and convincing 
evidence that--
            (1) the State or unit of local government is likely to 
        prevail on the merits at trial; and
            (2) the injunction would cause irreparable harm to the

this section unless it is commenced within 10 years after the cause of
