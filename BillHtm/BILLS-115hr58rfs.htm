            (2) on the degree to which the selected State and local 
        programs and policies included in such report were developed or 
        are being executed with funding from the Department of Homeland 
        Security, including grant funding from the State Homeland 
        Security Grant Program or the Urban Area Security Initiative 
        under sections 2002 and 2003, respectively, of the Homeland 
        Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 603 and 604).
