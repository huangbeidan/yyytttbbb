To provide for the issuance of a forever stamp to honor the work of Dr. 
  Michael Ellis DeBakey, who helped develop the mobile army surgical

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Michael E. DeBakey Stamp Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) Dr. Michael E. DeBakey was widely considered to be one 
        of the greatest surgeons ever, according to the Journal of the 
        American Medical Association;
            (2) his surgical inventions, such as the roller pump, which 
        is a component of the heart-lung machine used in open-heart 
        surgery, continue to save countless lives;
            (3) Dr. DeBakey's surgical innovations, for example the use 
        of Dacron grafts for damaged arteries, revolutionized the 
        practice of medicine nationally and globally;
            (4) his commitment to military medicine helped shape the 
        creation of the mobile army surgical hospital or MASH unit, and 
        a medical program for returning veterans; and
            (5) Dr. DeBakey was consulted regarding the health of 
        several world leaders, including President Boris N. Yeltsin 
        during the cold war.

SEC. 3. MICHAEL E. DEBAKEY STAMP.

    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this Act, the term ``forever 
stamp'' means a definitive stamp which meets the postage required for
