of Engineers for navigation, flood control, beach erosion control and 
shoreline protection, hydroelectric power, recreation, water supply, 
environmental protection, restoration, and enhancement, and fish and 
wildlife mitigation benefit all Americans, and because water resources 
development projects are critical to maintaining the country's economic 
prosperity, national security, and environmental protection, Congress 
should consider a water resources development bill not less often than 
once every Congress.

SEC. 113. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress plays a central role in identifying, 
        prioritizing, and authorizing vital water resources 
        infrastructure activities throughout the United States.
            (2) The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 
        (Public Law 113-121) established a new and transparent process 
        to review and prioritize the water resources development 
        activities of the Corps of Engineers with strong congressional 
        oversight.
            (3) Section 7001 of the Water Resources Reform and 
        Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2282d) requires the 
        Secretary to develop and submit to Congress each year a Report 
        to Congress on Future Water Resources Development and, as part 
        of the annual report process, to--
                    (A) publish a notice in the Federal Register that 
                requests from non-Federal interests proposed 
                feasibility studies and proposed modifications to 
                authorized water resources development projects and 
                feasibility studies for inclusion in the report; and
                    (B) review the proposals submitted and include in 
                the report those proposed feasibility studies and 
                proposed modifications that meet the criteria for 
                inclusion established under such section 7001.
            (4) Congress will use the information provided in the 
        annual Report to Congress on Future Water Resources Development 
        to determine authorization needs and priorities for purposes of 
        water resources development legislation.
            (5) To ensure that Congress can gain a thorough 
        understanding of the water resources development needs and 
        priorities of the United States, it is important that the 
        Secretary take sufficient steps to ensure that non-Federal 
        interests are made aware of the new annual report process, 
        including the need for non-Federal interests to submit 
        proposals during the Secretary's annual request for proposals 
        in order for such proposals to be eligible for consideration by 
        Congress.
    (b) Dissemination of Process Information.--The Secretary shall 
develop, support, and implement education and awareness efforts for 
non-Federal interests with respect to the annual Report to Congress on 
Future Water Resources Development required under section 7001 of the 
Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2282d), 
including efforts to--
            (1) develop and disseminate technical assistance materials, 
        seminars, and guidance on the annual process as it relates to 
        non-Federal interests;
            (2) provide written notice to local elected officials and 
        previous and potential non-Federal interests on the annual 
        process and on opportunities to address local water resources 
        challenges through the missions and authorities of the Corps of 
        Engineers;
            (3) issue guidance for non-Federal interests to assist such 
        interests in developing proposals for water resources 
        development projects that satisfy the requirements of such 
        section 7001; and
            (4) provide, at the request of a non-Federal interest, 
        assistance with researching and identifying existing project 
        authorizations and Corps of Engineers decision documents.

            (1) carry out a study on the economic principles and 
        analytical methodologies currently used by or applied to the 
        Corps of Engineers to formulate, evaluate, and budget for water 
        resources development projects; and
            (2) make recommendations to Congress on potential changes 
        to such principles and methodologies to improve transparency, 
        return on Federal investment, cost savings, and prioritization, 
        in the formulation, evaluation, and budgeting of such projects.
    (b) Considerations.--The study under subsection (a) shall include--
            (1) an analysis of the current economic principles and 
        analytical methodologies used by or applied to the Corps of 
        Engineers in determining the total benefits and total costs 
        during the formulation of, and plan selection for, a water 
        resources development project;
            (2) an analysis of improvements or alternatives to how the 
        Corps of Engineers utilizes the National Economic Development, 
        Regional Economic Development, Environmental Quality, and Other 
        Social Effects accounts developed by the Institute for Water 
        Resources of the Corps of Engineers in the formulation of, and 
        plan selection for, such projects;
            (3) an analysis of whether such principles and 
        methodologies fully account for all of the potential benefits 
        of project alternatives, including any reasonably associated 
        benefits of such alternatives that are not contrary to law, 
        Federal policy, or sound water resources management;
            (4) an analysis of whether such principles and 
        methodologies fully account for all of the costs of project 
        alternatives, including potential societal costs, such as lost 
        ecosystem services, and full life-cycle costs for such 
        alternatives; and
            (5) an analysis of the methodologies utilized by the 
        Federal Government in setting and applying discount rates for 
        benefit-cost analyses used in the formulation, evaluation, and 
        budgeting of Corps of Engineers water resources development 
        projects.
    (c) Publication.--The agreement entered into under subsection (a) 
shall require the National Academy of Sciences to, not later than 30 
days after the completion of the study--
            (1) submit a report containing the results of the study and 
        the recommendations to the Committee on Environment and Public 
        Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and 
        Infrastructure of the House of Representatives; and
            (2) make a copy of such report available on a publicly 
        accessible website.
    (d) Sense of Congress on Budgetary Evaluation Metrics and 
Transparency.--It is the sense of Congress that the President, in the 
formulation of the annual budget request for the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (Civil Works), should submit to Congress a budget that--
            (1) aligns the assessment of the potential benefit-cost 
        ratio for budgeting water resources development projects with 
        that used by the Corps of Engineers during project plan 
        formulation and evaluation pursuant to section 80 of the Water 
        Resources Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1962d-17); and
            (2) demonstrates the transparent criteria and metrics 
        utilized by the President in the evaluation and selection of 
        water resources development projects included in the budget 
        request.

            (2) to create an expedited and definitive process for 
        Congress to deauthorize water resources development projects
