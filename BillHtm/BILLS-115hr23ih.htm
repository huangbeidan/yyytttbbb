                        notifies, with a supporting explanation, the 
                        Federal lead agency, cooperating agencies, and

                                requirements under Federal, State, or 
                                local law;

                                the project application; or

                                not enough funding is available to 
                                complete the review by the deadline.

                review and Bureau of Reclamation project delivery 
                activities at the earliest practicable time to avoid 
                delays and duplication of effort later in the process, 
                prevent potential conflicts, and ensure that planning 
                and project development decisions reflect environmental 
                values; and

SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Accelerated Revenue, Repayment, 
and Surface Water Storage Enhancement Act''.

SEC. 702. PREPAYMENT OF CERTAIN REPAYMENT CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE UNITED 
              STATES AND CONTRACTORS OF FEDERALLY DEVELOPED WATER 
              SUPPLIES.

    (a) Conversion and Prepayment of Contracts.--
            (1) Conversion.--Upon request of the contractor, the 
        Secretary of the Interior shall convert any water service 
        contract in effect on the date of enactment of this Act and 
        between the United States and a water users' association to 
        allow for prepayment of the repayment contract pursuant to 
        paragraph (2) under mutually agreeable terms and conditions. 
        The manner of conversion under this paragraph shall be as 
        follows:
                    (A) Water service contracts that were entered into 
                under section 9(e) of the Act of August 4, 1939 (53 
                Stat. 1196), to be converted under this section shall 
                be converted to repayment contracts under section 9(d) 
                of that Act (53 Stat. 1195).
                    (B) Water service contracts that were entered under 
                subsection (c)(2) of section 9 of the Act of August 4, 
                1939 (53 Stat. 1194), to be converted under this

                subsection (c)(1) of section 9 of that Act (53 Stat. 
                1195).
            (2) Prepayment.--Except for those repayment contracts under 
        which the contractor has previously negotiated for prepayment, 
        all repayment contracts under section 9(d) of that Act (53 
        Stat. 1195) in effect on the date of enactment of this Act at 
        the request of the contractor, and all contracts converted 
        pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) shall--
                    (A) provide for the repayment, either in lump sum 
                or by accelerated prepayment, of the remaining 
                construction costs identified in water project specific 
                irrigation rate repayment schedules, as adjusted to 
                reflect payment not reflected in such schedule, and 
                properly assignable for ultimate return by the 
                contractor, or if made in approximately equal 
                installments, no later than 3 years after the effective 
                date of the repayment contract, such amount to be 
                discounted by \1/2\ the Treasury rate. An estimate of 
                the remaining construction costs, as adjusted, shall be 
                provided by the Secretary to the contractor no later 
                than 90 days following receipt of request of the 
                contractor;
                    (B) require that construction costs or other 
                capitalized costs incurred after the effective date of 
                the contract or not reflected in the rate schedule 
                referenced in subparagraph (A), and properly assignable 
                to such contractor shall be repaid in not more than 5 
                years after notification of the allocation if such 
                amount is a result of a collective annual allocation of 
                capital costs to the contractors exercising contract 
                conversation under this subsection of less than 
                $5,000,000. If such amount is $5,000,000 or greater, 
                such cost shall be repaid as provided by applicable 
                reclamation law;
                    (C) provide that power revenues will not be 
                available to aid in repayment of construction costs 
                allocated to irrigation under the contract; and
                    (D) continue so long as the contractor pays 
                applicable charges, consistent with section 9(d) of the 
                Act of August 4, 1939 (53 Stat. 1195), and applicable 
                law.
            (3) Contract requirements.--Except for those repayment

        for prepayment, the following shall apply with regard to all 
        repayment contracts under subsection (c)(1) of section 9 of 
        that Act (53 Stat. 1195) in effect on the date of enactment of 
        this Act at the request of the contractor, and all contracts

                    (A) Provide for the repayment in lump sum of the 
                remaining construction costs identified in water 
                project specific municipal and industrial rate 
                repayment schedules, as adjusted to reflect payments 
                not reflected in such schedule, and properly assignable 
                for ultimate return by the contractor. An estimate of 
                the remaining construction costs, as adjusted, shall be 
                provided by the Secretary to the contractor no later 
                than 90 days after receipt of request of contractor.
                    (B) The contract shall require that construction 
                costs or other capitalized costs incurred after the 
                effective date of the contract or not reflected in the 
                rate schedule referenced in subparagraph (A), and 
                properly assignable to such contractor, shall be repaid 
                in not more than 5 years after notification of the 
                allocation if such amount is a result of a collective 
                annual allocation of capital costs to the contractors 
                exercising contract conversation under this subsection 
                of less than $5,000,000. If such amount is $5,000,000 
                or greater, such cost shall be repaid as provided by 
                applicable reclamation law.
                    (C) Continue so long as the contractor pays 
                applicable charges, consistent with section 9(c)(1) of 
                the Act of August 4, 1939 (53 Stat. 1195), and 
                applicable law.
            (4) Conditions.--All contracts entered into pursuant to 
        paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall--
                    (A) not be adjusted on the basis of the type of 
                prepayment financing used by the water users' 
                association;
                    (B) conform to any other agreements, such as 
                applicable settlement agreements and new constructed 
                appurtenant facilities; and
                    (C) not modify other water service, repayment, 
                exchange and transfer contractual rights between the 
                water users' association, and the Bureau of 
                Reclamation, or any rights, obligations, or 
                relationships of the water users' association and their 
                landowners as provided under State law.
    (b) Accounting.--The amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) shall 
be subject to adjustment following a final cost allocation by the 
Secretary of the Interior. In the event that the final cost allocation 
indicates that the costs properly assignable to the contractor are 
greater than what has been paid by the contractor, the contractor shall 
be obligated to pay the remaining allocated costs. The term of such 
additional repayment contract shall be not less than one year and not 
more than 10 years, however, mutually agreeable provisions regarding 
the rate of repayment of such amount may be developed by the parties. 
In the event that the final cost allocation indicates that the costs 
properly assignable to the contractor are less than what the contractor 
has paid, the Secretary shall credit such overpayment as an offset 
against any outstanding or future obligation of the contractor.
    (c) Applicability of Certain Provisions.--
            (1) Effect of existing law.--Upon a contractor's compliance 
        with and discharge of the obligation of repayment of the

        the construction costs assignable to the contractor or the 
        applicability of subsections (a) and (b) of section 213 of the 
        Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1269) once the amount
