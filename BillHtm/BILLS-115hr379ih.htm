 To assist members of the Yazidi and Christian communities residing in 
                Iraq and Syria, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Justice for Yazidis Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Preventing genocide and mass atrocities is a national 
        priority of the United States.
            (2) Atrocities committed by the Islamic State (IS) against 
        Yazidis and other minorities have included mass murder, 
        crucifixions, beheadings, rape, torture, enslavement, 
        trafficking, and the kidnapping of children.
            (3) IS engages in, and publicly argues in favor of, the 
        sexual enslavement of Yazidi women and girls.
            (4) The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and 
        Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, signed and ratified by the 
        United States, defines genocide as follows: ``any of the 
        following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole 
        or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as 
        such:
            ``(a) killing members of the group;
            ``(b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of 
        the group;
            ``(c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of 
        life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in 
        whole or in part;
            ``(d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within 
        the group; and
            ``(e) forcibly transferring children of the group to 
        another group.''.
            (5) In December 2015, the United States Holocaust Memorial 
        Museum's Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide 
        issued a report titled ``Our Generation Is Gone--the Islamic 
        State's Targeting of Iraqi Minorities in Ninewa'', which 
        concluded that ``IS committed crimes against humanity, war 
        crimes, and ethnic cleansing . . . [and] perpetrated genocide 
        against the Yezidi people''.
            (6) On December 7, 2015, the United States Commission on 
        International Religious Freedom called on the United States 
        Government ``to designate the Christian, Yezidi, Shi'a, 
        Turkmen, and Shabak communities of Iraq and Syria as victims of 
        genocide by ISIL''.
            (7) On February 3, 2016, the European Parliament 
        unanimously passed a resolution declaring that IS ``is 
        committing genocide against Christians and Yezidis, and other 
        religious and ethnic minorities''.
            (8) On March 14, 2016, the United States House of 
        Representatives passed H. Con. Res. 75, expressing the sense of 
        Congress that the atrocities perpetrated by IS against 
        religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria include war 
        crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, by a unanimous 
        vote of 393-0.
            (9) On March 17, 2016, United States Secretary of State 
        John Kerry declared that IS is ``responsible for genocide 
        against groups under its control including Yazidis, Christians, 
        and Shiite Muslims''.
            (10) On June 15, 2016, the United Nations Human Rights 
        Council issued the report ``They Came to Destroy: ISIS Crimes 
        Against the Yazidis'' which stated that IS ``has committed the 
        crime of genocide as well as multiple crimes against humanity 
        and war crimes against the Yazidis, thousands of whom are held 
        captive in the Syrian Arab Republic where they are subjected to 
        almost unimaginable horrors''.
            (11) President Barack Obama established the Atrocities 
        Prevention Board in 2011, and stated that ``preventing 
        atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest 
        and a core moral responsibility of the United States''.
            (12) Over 3,200 Yazidi women and children are still being 
        held by IS.
            (13) The atrocities committed by IS should be investigated 
        through the establishment of a United Nations Ad-hoc Tribunal 
        for the purpose of documenting mass graves and prosecuting 
        cases of mass atrocities.
            (14) It is in the interest of the United States that the 
        United States Armed Forces cooperate with friendly forces in 
        Syria and Iraq for the purpose of securing members of the 
        Yazidi and Christian communities being held captive by IS.
