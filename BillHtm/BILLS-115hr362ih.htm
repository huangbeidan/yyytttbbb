Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The tragedy of January 8, 2011, at Congresswoman 
        Gabrielle Gifford's ``Congress on Your Corner'' event resulted 
        in the deaths of 6 people (Christina-Taylor Green, Dorothy 
        Morris, U.S. District Court Judge John Roll, Phyllis Schneck, 
        Dorwan Stoddard, and Gabe Zimmerman) and injury of 13 others 
        (Congresswoman Giffords, Bill Badger, Ron Barber, Kenneth 
        Dorushka, James Eric Fuller, Randy Gardner, Susan Hileman, 
        George Morris, Mary Reed, Pam Simon, Mavanell Stoddard, Jim 
        Tucker, and Kenneth Veeder).
            (2) This was the first time in the history of the United 
        States that an assassination attempt was made upon a 
        Congressional Member while she was meeting with constituents.
            (3) Congresswoman Giffords sustained severe injuries that 
        affect her to this day.
            (4) Gabe Zimmerman was the first Congressional staffer to 
        be assassinated in the line of duty.
            (5) The Arizona community and people from all over the 
        world came together in the days that followed the tragedy to 
        provide comfort and support to one another at three spontaneous 
        memorial vigil sites--
                    (A) the shopping center where the shooting took 
                place;
                    (B) the front lawn of University Medical Center, 
                where many of the victims were treated; and
                    (C) at Congresswoman Giffords' Tucson district 
                office.
            (6) Tucson's January 8th Memorial will not only be a 
        tribute to those who died that day, but also to the local, 
        national, and international response to the tragedy.
            (7) The memorial will be constructed, managed, and 
        maintained to be a place where visitors, young and old, can 
        learn not only about one horrific event, but about the 
        resilience of a community and the durability of democracy in 
        the United States.
