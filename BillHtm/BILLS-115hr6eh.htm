       TITLE I--MEDICAID PROVISIONS TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID CRISIS

SEC. 1001. AT-RISK YOUTH MEDICAID PROTECTION.

    (a) In General.--Section 1902 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1396a) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph 
                (82);
                    (B) by striking the period at the end of paragraph 
                (83) and inserting ``; and''; and
                    (C) by inserting after paragraph (83) the following 
                new paragraph:
            ``(84) provide that--
                    ``(A) the State shall not terminate eligibility for 
                medical assistance under the State plan for an 
                individual who is an eligible juvenile (as defined in 
                subsection (nn)(2)) because the juvenile is an inmate 
                of a public institution (as defined in subsection 
                (nn)(3)), but may suspend coverage during the period 
                the juvenile is such an inmate;
                    ``(B) in the case of an individual who is an 
                eligible juvenile described in paragraph (2)(A) of 
                subsection (nn), the State shall, prior to the 
                individual's release from such a public institution, 
                conduct a redetermination of eligibility for such 
                individual with respect to such medical assistance 
                (without requiring a new application from the 
                individual) and, if the State determines pursuant to 
                such redetermination that the individual continues to 
                meet the eligibility requirements for such medical 
                assistance, the State shall restore coverage for such 
                medical assistance to such an individual upon the 
                individual's release from such public institution; and
                    ``(C) in the case of an individual who is an 
                eligible juvenile described in paragraph (2)(B) of 
                subsection (nn), the State shall process any 
                application for medical assistance submitted by, or on 
                behalf of, such individual such that the State makes a 
                determination of eligibility for such individual with 
                respect to such medical assistance upon release of such 
                individual from such public institution.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(nn) Juvenile; Eligible Juvenile; Public Institution.--For 
purposes of subsection (a)(84) and this subsection:
            ``(1) Juvenile.--The term `juvenile' means an individual 
        who is--
                    ``(A) under 21 years of age; or
                    ``(B) described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(IX).
            ``(2) Eligible juvenile.--The term `eligible juvenile' 
        means a juvenile who is an inmate of a public institution and 
        who--
                    ``(A) was determined eligible for medical 
                assistance under the State plan immediately before 
                becoming an inmate of such a public institution; or
                    ``(B) is determined eligible for such medical 
                assistance while an inmate of a public institution.
            ``(3) Inmate of a public institution.--The term `inmate of 
        a public institution' has the meaning given such term for 
        purposes of applying the subdivision (A) following paragraph 
        (29) of section 1905(a), taking into account the exception in 
        such subdivision for a patient of a medical institution.''.
    (b) No Change in Exclusion From Medical Assistance for Inmates of 
Public Institutions.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as 
changing the exclusion from medical assistance under the subdivision 
(A) following paragraph (29) of section 1905(a) of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)), including any applicable restrictions on a 
State submitting claims for Federal financial participation under title 
XIX of such Act for such assistance.
    (c) No Change in Continuity of Eligibility Before Adjudication or 
Sentencing.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to mandate, 
encourage, or suggest that a State suspend or terminate coverage for 
individuals before they have been adjudicated or sentenced.
    (d) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply to eligibility of 
        juveniles who become inmates of public institutions on or after 
        the date that is 1 year after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act.
            (2) Rule for changes requiring state legislation.--In the 
        case of a State plan for medical assistance under title XIX of 
        the Social Security Act which the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services determines requires State legislation (other than 
        legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet 
        the additional requirements imposed by the amendments made by 
        subsection (a), the State plan shall not be regarded as failing 
        to comply with the requirements of such title solely on the 
        basis of its failure to meet these additional requirements 
        before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning 
        after the close of the first regular session of the State 
        legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a 
        State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such 
        session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the 
        State legislature.

                State''; and
                    (C) in item (dd), by striking ``the State plan 
                under this title or under a waiver of the'' and

        shall take effect with respect to foster youth who attain 18

                such youth regarding Medicaid coverage options for such 
                youth; and
            (2) which shall include examples of States that have 
        successfully extended Medicaid coverage to former foster youth 
        up to age 26.

                written notice of the selection or change of selection 
                and a rationale for the selection or change.

                any requirement imposed by the amendments made by this

                as failing to comply with the requirements of such

                an additional requirement before the first day of the 
                first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the 
                first regular session of the State legislature that

                of the session shall be considered to be a separate 
                regular session of the State legislature.

        that begins after the date of enactment of this section. For 
        purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State that 
        has a 2-year legislative session, each year of the session 
        shall be considered to be a separate regular session of the 
        State legislature.

Program Innovation.--
            (1) Stakeholder group best practices.--Not later than 6 
        months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the

        the National Association of Medicaid Directors, and other 
        relevant representatives from local, State, and Federal jail

        Secretary and Congress a report on such best practices) for 
        States--

                an individual who is an inmate of a public institution 
                from the public institution to the community, including 
                best practices for ensuring continuity of health 
                insurance coverage or coverage under the State Medicaid 
                plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act, as 
                applicable, and relevant social services; and
                    (B) to carry out, with respect to such an 
                individual, such health care-related transition not 
                later than 30 days after such individual is released

            (2) State medicaid program innovation.--The Secretary of 
        Health and Human Services shall work with States on innovative

        institutions and otherwise eligible for medical assistance 
        under the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social 
        Security Act transition, with respect to enrollment for medical 
        assistance under such program, seamlessly to the community.
    (b) Guidance on Innovative Service Delivery Systems Demonstration 
Project Opportunities.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services, shall issue a State Medicaid Director letter, based on best 
practices developed under subsection (a)(1), regarding opportunities to 
design demonstration projects under section 1115 of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1315) to improve care transitions for certain 
individuals who are soon-to-be former inmates of a public institution 
and who are otherwise eligible to receive medical assistance under

Security Act or any other provision of law precludes a State from 
reclassifying or suspending (rather than terminating) eligibility of an 
individual for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social 
Security Act while such individual is an inmate of a public 
institution.

``SEC. 1944. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO QUALIFIED PRESCRIPTION DRUG 
              MONITORING PROGRAMS AND PRESCRIBING CERTAIN CONTROLLED 
              SUBSTANCES.

subject to subsection (d), require each covered provider to check, in 
accordance with such timing, manner, and form as specified by the 
State, the prescription drug history of a covered individual being 
treated by the covered provider through a qualified prescription drug 
monitoring program described in subsection (b) before prescribing to 
such individual a controlled substance.

A qualified prescription drug monitoring program described in this 
subsection, with respect to a State, may have in place, in accordance 
with applicable State and Federal law, a data sharing agreement with 
the State Medicaid program that allows the medical director and 
pharmacy director of such program (and any designee of such a director 
who reports directly to such director) to access the information 
described in paragraph (1) in an electronic format. The State Medicaid 
program under this title may facilitate reasonable and limited access, 
as determined by the State and ensuring documented beneficiary 
protections regarding the use of such data, to such qualified 
prescription drug monitoring program for the medical director or 
pharmacy director of any managed care entity (as defined under section 
1932(a)(1)(B)) that has a contract with the State under section 1903(m) 
or under section 1905(t)(3), or the medical director or pharmacy 
director of any entity has a contract to manage the pharmaceutical 
benefit with respect to individuals enrolled in the State plan (or 
waiver of the State plan). All applicable State and Federal security 
and privacy laws shall apply to the directors or designees of such 
directors of any State Medicaid program or entity accessing a qualified 
prescription drug monitoring program under this section.
    ``(c) Application of Privacy Rules Clarification.--The Secretary 
shall clarify privacy requirements, including requirements under the 
regulations promulgated pursuant to section 264(c) of the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 1320d-2

requirement under subsection (a), with respect to a State, in the case 
of natural disasters and similar situations, and in the case of the 
provision of emergency services (as defined for purposes of section

`administering State') has in place agreements with all States that are 
contiguous to such administering State that, when combined, enable 
covered providers in all such contiguous States to access, through the 
prescription drug management program, the information that is described 
in subsection (b)(1) of covered individuals of such administering State

access through such program. In no case shall an increase under this 
subsection result in a Federal medical assistance percentage or Federal 
matching rate that exceeds 100 percent.

        opioid addiction and coverage and payment under the Medicare 
        and Medicaid programs of appropriate opioid addiction 
        treatments.
            (4) Recommendations for policies under the Medicare program 
        and under the Medicaid program that can expand access for 
        rural, or medically underserved communities to the full range 
        of medication-assisted treatment approved by the Food and Drug 
        Administration for the treatment of opioid addiction and other 
        therapies that manage chronic and acute pain and treatment and 
        minimize risk of opioid addiction.
            (5) Recommendations on changes to the Medicare program and 
        the Medicaid program to address coverage or payment barriers to 
        patient access to medical devices that are non-opioid based 
        treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the 
        management of acute pain and chronic pain, for monitoring 
        substance use withdrawal and preventing overdoses of controlled 
        substances, and for treating substance use disorder.

        eligible individuals enrolled in prescription drug plans under 
        part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act and MA-PD 
        plans under part C of such title to reduce access delays by 
        resolving coverage issues before prescriptions for such drugs 
        are transmitted; and
            (2) greater priority should be placed on increasing the 
        adoption of use of such electronic prior authorizations among 
        prescribers of such drugs, pharmacies, PDP sponsors, and 
        Medicare Advantage organizations.

       Subtitle I--Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren

SEC. 8081. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Supporting Grandparents Raising 
Grandchildren Act''.

SEC. 8082. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) More than 2,500,000 grandparents in the United States 
        are the primary caretaker of their grandchildren, and experts 
        report that such numbers are increasing as the opioid epidemic 
        expands.
            (2) Between 2009 and 2016, the incidence of parental 
        alcohol or other drug use as a contributing factor for 
        children's out-of-home placement rose from 25.4 to 37.4 
        percent.
            (3) When children cannot remain safely with their parents, 
        placement with relatives is preferred over placement in foster 
        care with nonrelatives because placement with relatives 
        provides stability for children and helps them maintain family 
        connections.
            (4) The number of foster children placed with a grandparent 
        or other relative increased from 24 percent in 2006 to 32 
        percent in 2016, according to data from the Department of 
        Health and Human Services.
            (5) Grandparents' lives are enhanced by caring for their 
        grandchildren; the overwhelming majority of grandparents report 
        experiencing significant benefits in serving as their 
        grandchildren's primary caregivers.
            (6) Providing full-time care to their grandchildren may 
        decrease grandparents' ability to address their own physical 
        and mental health needs and personal well-being.
            (7) Grandparents would benefit from better coordination and 
        dissemination of information and resources available to support 
        them in their caregiving responsibilities.

              GRANDCHILDREN.

        (1) shall not take effect until 30 days after the date of the

        in any schedule, and so advises the Attorney General in 
        writing, the Attorney General may not issue a permanent 
        scheduling order under subparagraph (A) and shall, within 30 
        days of receiving the Secretary's advice issue an order
