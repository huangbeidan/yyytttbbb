        incident;
            (3) the sources of potential members of such a Civilian

        to recruit, train, and manage such a Civilian Cyber Defense 
        National Resource;
            (5) the criteria required for persons to serve in such a 
        Civilian Cyber Defense National Resource;
            (6) the resources that could be pre-positioned and training 
        instilled to assure the effectiveness and responsiveness of 
        such a Civilian Cyber Defense National Resource in the case of 
        an incident that disrupts communications in a region or area;
            (7) the minimum requirements for consideration for 
        inclusion in such a Civilian Cyber Defense National Resource;

        on the effectiveness of a Civilian Cyber Defense National 
        Resource;
            (9) the recruitment and vetting costs for such a Civilian 
        Cyber Defense National Resource;

        training necessary for maintaining such a Civilian Cyber 
        Defense National Resource;

        adapted for use in creating command and control systems and 
        protocols for a Civilian Cyber Defense National Resource;
            (12) the logistics of allowing governors to make requests 
        of the Secretary of Homeland Security to use the Civilian Cyber 
        Defense National Resource in States during times of cyber 
        emergency;
            (13) the advantages and disadvantages of creating a 
        Civilian Cyber Defense National Resource on the cybersecurity 
        of the United States; and
            (14) whether a resource trained to defend the networks of 
        the United States in the event of a major attack or natural or 
        manmade disaster will benefit overall efforts to defend the 
        interests of the United States.
    (c) Report.--
            (1) Submission.--Not later than 240 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security
