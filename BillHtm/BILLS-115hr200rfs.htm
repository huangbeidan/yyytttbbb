    ``(m) Considerations for Modifications to Annual Catch Limit 
Requirements.--
            ``(1) Annual catch limit requirement for certain data-poor 
        fisheries.--Notwithstanding subsection (h)(6), in the case of a 
        stock of fish for which the total annual catch limit is 25 
        percent or more below the overfishing limit, a peer-reviewed 
        stock survey and stock assessment have not been performed 
        during the preceding 5 fishing years, and the stock is not 
        subject to overfishing, a Council may, after notifying the 
        Secretary, maintain the current annual catch limit for the 
        stock until a peer-reviewed stock survey and stock assessment 
        are conducted and the results are considered by the Council and 
        its scientific and statistical committee.
            ``(2) Consideration of ecosystem and economic impacts.--In 
        establishing annual catch limits a Council may, consistent with 
        subsection (h)(6), consider changes in an ecosystem and the 
        economic needs of the fishing communities.
            ``(3) Limitations to annual catch limit requirement for 
        special fisheries.--Notwithstanding subsection (h)(6), a 
        Council is not required to develop an annual catch limit for--
                    ``(A) an ecosystem-component species;
                    ``(B) a fishery for a species that has a life cycle 
                of approximately 1 year, unless the Secretary has 
                determined the fishery is subject to overfishing; or
                    ``(C) a stock for which--
                            ``(i) more than half of a single-year class 
                        will complete their life cycle in less than 18 
                        months; and
                            ``(ii) fishing mortality will have little 
                        impact on the stock.
            ``(4) Relationship to international fishery efforts.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Each annual catch limit, 
                consistent with subsection (h)(6)--
                            ``(i) may take into account management 
                        measures under international agreements in 
                        which the United States participates; and

                        developed by a Council for a species, shall 
                        take into account fishing for the species

                        life-history characteristics of the species 
                        that are not subject to the jurisdiction of the 
                        Council.
                    ``(B) Exception to annual catch limit 
                requirement.--If fishery management activities by 
                another country with respect to fishing outside the 
                exclusive economic zone may hinder conservation efforts 
                by United States fishermen for a fish species for which 
                any of the recruitment, distribution, life history, or 
                fishing activities are transboundary, and for which 
                there is no informal transboundary agreement with that 
                country in effect, then--
                            ``(i) notwithstanding subsection (h)(6), no 
                        annual catch limit is required to be developed

                        developed by a Council for the species, the 
                        catch limit shall take into account fishing for 
                        the species outside the exclusive economic zone 
                        that is not subject to the jurisdiction of the 
                        Council.
            ``(5) Authorization for multispecies complexes and 
        multiyear annual catch limits.--For purposes of subsection 
        (h)(6), a Council may establish--
                    ``(A) an annual catch limit for a stock complex; or

        subsection the term `ecosystem-component species' means a stock 
        of fish that is a nontarget, incidentally harvested stock of 
        fish in a fishery, or a nontarget, incidentally harvested stock 
        of fish that a Council or the Secretary has determined--

                overfishing or depleted in the absence of conservation 
                and management measures.
            ``(7) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be construed as providing an exemption from the 
        requirements of section 301(a) of this Act.''.
    (b) Action by the Secretary.--Section 304 (16 U.S.C. 1854) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``(i) International Overfishing.--'' and

        an individual, cooperative, community, processor, 
        representative of a commercial sector, or regional fishery

                    (B) recommending policies to address the inequities 
                identified in subparagraph (A); and
                    (C) identifying and recommending the different 
                factors and information a mixed-use fishery should 
                consider when designing, establishing, or maintaining a 
                limited access privilege program to mitigate any 
                inequities identified in subparagraph (A); and
            (2) submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a 
        report on the study under paragraph (1), including the

        shall be a moratorium on the submission and approval of a 
        limited access privilege program for a mixed-use fishery until 
        the date that the report is submitted under subsection 
        (a)(1)(B).
            (2) Exception.--Subject to paragraph (3), a Council may 
        submit, and the Secretary of Commerce may approve, for a mixed-
        use fishery that is managed under a limited access system, a 
        limited access privilege program if such program was part of a 
        pending fishery management plan or plan amendment before the 
        date of enactment of this Act.
            (3) Mandatory review.--A Council that approves a limited 
        access privilege program under paragraph (2) shall, upon 
        issuance of the report required under subparagraph (a), review 
        and, to the extent practicable, revise the limited access 
        privilege program to be consistent with the recommendations of 
        the report or any subsequent statutory or regulatory 
        requirements designed to implement the recommendations of the 
        report.
            (4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section may be
