                disclose to the head of the agency information limited 
                to describing whether the person has a seriously 
                delinquent tax debt.
            (2) Impact on responsibility determination.--The head of 
        any executive agency, in evaluating any offer received in 
        response to a solicitation issued by the agency for bids or 
        proposals for a contract, shall consider a certification that 
        the offeror has a seriously delinquent tax debt to be 
        definitive proof that the offeror is not a responsible source 
        as defined in section 113 of title 41, United States Code.
            (3) Debarment.--
                    (A) Requirement.--Except as provided in

                person after receiving an offer for a contract from 
                such person if--
                            (i) such offer contains a certification (as 
                        required under paragraph (1)(A)) that such 
                        person has a seriously delinquent tax debt; or

                        (as authorized under paragraph (1)(B)) 
                        demonstrating that such a certification 
                        submitted by such person is false.

                circumstances significantly affecting the interests of 
                the United States. If the head of an executive agency 
                waives subparagraph (A) for a person, the head of the

                    (A) certifying whether such applicant has a 
                seriously delinquent tax debt; and
                    (B) authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to 
                disclose to the head of the agency information limited

            (2) Impact on determination of financial stability.--The 
        head of any executive agency, in evaluating any application for 
        a grant offered by the agency, shall consider a certification

        delinquent tax debt to be definitive proof that the applicant 
        is high-risk and shall--
                    (A) decline the grant application;
                    (B) ensure that the applicant does not receive any 
                future grant offered by the agency; and
                    (C) in the case of an applicant that has, as of the 
                date on which the grant application is denied under 
                subparagraph (A), an existing grant previously awarded 
                by the agency, take appropriate measures under 
                guidelines issued by the Office of Management and
