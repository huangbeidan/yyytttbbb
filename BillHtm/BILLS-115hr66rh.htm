                                 A BILL


 
    To establish the Route 66 Centennial Commission, to direct the 
Secretary of Transportation to prepare a plan on the preservation needs 
                  of Route 66, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Route 66 Centennial Commission 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Route 66 was the Nation's first all-paved highway under 
        the U.S. Highway System connecting the Midwest to California 
        and has played a major role in the history of the United 
        States.
            (2) Route 66 was the symbol of opportunity to hundreds of 
        thousands of people seeking escape from the Dust Bowl in the 
        1930s, serving as a ``road to opportunity'' in the West and 
        providing employment during the Great Depression, as thousands 
        were put to work on road crews to pave the road.
            (3) Route 66 was invaluable in transporting troops, 
        equipment, and supplies across the country to the West, where 
        the government established multiple industries and armed force 
        bases during World War II. Upon the conclusion of the war in 
        1945, Route 66 was a key route taken by thousands of troops as 
        they returned home.
            (4) Route 66 symbolized the Nation's positive outlook 
        during the postwar economic recovery in the 1950s and 1960s, 
        serving as an icon of free-spirited independence and linking 
        people across the United States. During this period, the 
        tourist industry along Route 66 grew tremendously, giving rise 
        to countless tourist courts, motels, service stations, garages, 
        and diners.
            (5) Since June 27, 1985, when Route 66 was decommissioned 
        as a Federal highway, the popularity and mythical stature of 
        Route 66 has grown domestically and internationally, as the 
        road has experienced a rebirth of interest and support.
            (6) The year 2026 will be the centennial anniversary of 
        Route 66, and a commission should be established to study and 
        recommend to Congress activities that are fitting and proper to 
        celebrate that anniversary in a manner that appropriately 
        honors America's Mother Road.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.

    There is established a commission to be known as the Route 66 
Centennial Commission (referred to in this Act as the ``Commission'').

SEC. 4. DUTIES.

    The Commission shall have the following duties:
            (1) To study activities that may be carried out by the

        centennial anniversary, including any of the activities 
        described under section 8(b)(2)(B).
            (2) To recommend to Congress the activities the Commission 
        considers most fitting and proper to honor Route 66 on such 
        occasion, to be carried out by the Department of Transportation 
        and any other entity or entities within the Federal Government 
        that the Commission considers most appropriate to carry out 
        such activities.
            (3) To plan and host, in cooperation with such partners, a
