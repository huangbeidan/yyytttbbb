  Haitian students whose studies were interrupted as a result of the 
January 12, 2010, earthquake, or the October 2016 hurricane, Hurricane 
                                Matthew.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Haitian Educational Empowerment Act 
of 2017''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew devastated Haiti, 
        killing over 1,000 people, and directly affected 2.1 million 
        people, including the internal displacement of 175,000 and 1.4 
        million people in need of urgent humanitarian aid.
            (2) The storm damage has been estimated to be 
        $1,000,000,000, or about 11.4 percent of the gross domestic 
        product of Haiti.
            (3) Hurricane Matthew was the worst hurricane to hit Haiti 
        in over 50 years.
            (4) Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
            (5) Eighty percent of the population lives below the 
        poverty line, and approximately 45 percent of the population is 
        illiterate.
            (6) On January 12, 2010, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck 
        the country of Haiti.
            (7) The earthquake caused massive devastation across Haiti, 
        destroying government buildings, hospitals, schools, and vital 
        aid offices, including the headquarters of the United Nations 
        mission to Haiti.
            (8) An estimated three million people were directly 
        affected by the earthquake in Haiti, nearly one-third of the 
        country's population.
            (9) Many universities suffered significant structural 
        damage, including the State University of Haiti, the country's 
        main public university, which had 80 percent of its buildings 
        destroyed.
            (10) The earthquake claimed the lives of many students and 
        several prominent academics.
            (11) Before the earthquake, at least 85 percent of Haitians 
        with a university degree left the island.
            (12) A more highly educated population is vital to Haiti's 
        long-term development.
