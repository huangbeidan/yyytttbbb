SEC. 133. MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the 
        establishment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise 
        program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113), discrimination and 
        related barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for 
        minority- and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in 
        airport-related markets across the Nation. These continuing 
        barriers merit the continuation of the airport disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program.
            (2) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
        documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous 
        sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, 
        scientific reports, reports issued by public and private 
        agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by 
        organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits. 
        This testimony and documentation shows that race- and gender-
        neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address the problem.
            (3) This testimony and documentation demonstrates that 
        discrimination across the Nation poses a barrier to full and 
        fair participation in airport-related businesses of women 
        business owners and minority business owners in the racial 
        groups detailed in parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, and has impacted firm development and many aspects 
        of airport-related business in the public and private markets.
            (4) This testimony and documentation provides a strong 
        basis that there is a compelling need for the continuation of 
        the airport disadvantaged business enterprise program and the 
        airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprise program 
        to address race and gender discrimination in airport-related 
        business.

amending an existing procedure that would direct aircraft between the 
surface and 6,000 feet above ground level over noise sensitive areas, 
the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consider 
the feasibility of dispersal headings or other lateral track variations 
to address community noise concerns, if--
            (1) the affected airport operator, in consultation with the 
        affected community, submits a request to the Administrator for 
        such a consideration;
            (2) the airport operator's request would not, in the 
        judgment of the Administrator, conflict with the safe and 
        efficient operation of the national airspace system; and
            (3) the effect of a modified departure procedure would not 
        significantly increase noise over noise sensitive areas, as 
        determined by the Administrator.

SEC. 157. STUDY ON POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACTS OF OVERFLIGHT NOISE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of

institution of higher education to conduct a study on the health 
impacts of noise from aircraft flights on residents exposed to a range 
of noise levels from such flights.
    (b) Scope of Study.--The study shall--
            (1) include an examination of the incremental health 
        impacts attributable to noise exposure that result from 
        aircraft flights, including sleep disturbance and elevated 
        blood pressure;
            (2) be focused on residents in the metropolitan area of--
                    (A) Boston;
                    (B) Chicago;

                Administrator;
            (3) consider, in particular, the incremental health impacts 
        on residents living partly or wholly underneath flight paths 
        most frequently used by aircraft flying at an altitude lower 
        than 10,000 feet, including during takeoff or landing; and
            (4) include an assessment of the relationship between a 
        perceived increase in aircraft noise, including as a result of 
        a change in flight paths that increases the visibility of 
        aircraft from a certain location, and an actual increase in 
        aircraft noise, particularly in areas with high or variable 
        levels of nonaircraft-related ambient noise.
    (c) Eligibility.--An institution of higher education is eligible to 
conduct the study if the institution--
            (1) has--
                    (A) a school of public health that has participated 
                in the Center of Excellence for Aircraft Noise and

        (b);
            (3) applies to the Administrator in a timely fashion;
            (4) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator 
        that the institution is qualified to conduct the study;

        years after entering into an agreement under subsection (a), 
        the results of the study, including any source materials used; 
        and
            (6) meets such other requirements as the Administrator 
        determines necessary.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the Administrator 
receives the results of the study, the Administrator shall submit to 
the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate a report containing the results.

        aircraft in an unauthorized manner;
            (6) the Administrator should place particular priority on 
        continuing measures, including partnerships with 
        nongovernmental organizations, to educate the public about the 
        dangers to the public safety of operating unmanned aircraft 
        near airports without the appropriate approvals or 
        authorizations; and
            (7) manufacturers and retail sellers of small unmanned

        and women interested in pursuing careers in the aviation and 
        aerospace industry, the long-term personnel needs of the 
        aviation and aerospace industry, and the role of aviation in
