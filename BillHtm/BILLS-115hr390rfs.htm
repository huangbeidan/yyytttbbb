                                 AN ACT


 
  To provide emergency relief for victims of genocide, crimes against 
  humanity, and war crimes in Iraq and Syria, for accountability for 
         perpetrators of these crimes, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency 
Relief and Accountability Act of 2017''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria are 
        persecuted groups, and the Secretary of State of State declared 
        on March 17, 2016, that Daesh, also known as the Islamic State 
        of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), was responsible for genocide, crimes 
        against humanity, and other atrocity crimes against several of 
        these groups, including Christians and Yezidis.
            (2) According to the Department of State's annual reports 
        on international religious freedom, the number of Christians 
        living in Iraq has dropped from an estimated 800,000 to 1.4 
        million in 2002 to fewer than 250,000 in 2015, and the number 
        of Yezidis living in Iraq has dropped from 500,000 in 2013 to 
        350,000 to 400,000 in 2015.
            (3) The annual reports on international religious freedom 
        further suggest that Christian communities living in Syria, 
        which had accounted for between 8 and 10 percent of Syria's 
        total population in 2010, are now ``considerably'' smaller as a 
        result of the civil war, and that the population of 
        approximately 80,000 Yezidis in 2010 may now be larger because 
        of refugees from Iraq.
            (4) Local communities and entities have sought to mitigate 
        the impact of violence directed against religious and ethnic 
        minorities in Iraq and Syria, including the Chaldean Catholic 
        Archdiocese of Erbil (Kurdistan Region of Iraq), which has used 
        private funds to provide assistance to internally displaced 
        Christians, Yezidis, and Muslims throughout the greater Erbil 
        region, while growing needs and diminishing resources have made 
        it increasingly difficult to continue these efforts.
