                                 A BILL


 
  To establish in the Smithsonian Institution a comprehensive women's 
                history museum, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Smithsonian Women's History Museum 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since its founding, the United States has greatly 
        benefitted from the contributions of women.
            (2) Historical accounts, monuments, memorials, and museums 
        disproportionately represent men's achievements and 
        contributions and often neglect those of women. For example--
                    (A) a study of 18 American history textbooks 
                concluded that 10 percent of the material documented 
                contributions of women;
                    (B) 9 statues out of 91 in the United States 
                Capitol's National Statuary Hall depict women; and
                    (C) only one of the 44 monuments operated by the 
                National Park Service specifically honors the 
                achievements of women after the 2016 designation of the 
                Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument.
            (3) There exists no national museum in the United States 
        that is devoted to the documentation of women's contributions 
        throughout the Nation's history.
            (4) Establishing a comprehensive women's history museum 
        representing a diverse range of viewpoints, experience, and 
        backgrounds is necessary to more accurately depict the history 
        of the United States and would add value to the Smithsonian 
        Institution.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF MUSEUM.

    (a) Establishment.--There is established within the Smithsonian 
Institution a comprehensive women's history museum, to be named by the 
Board of Regents in consultation with the Council established under 
section 4.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the museum established under this 
section shall be to provide for--
            (1) the collection, study, and establishment of programs 
        relating to women's contributions to various fields and 
        throughout different periods of history that have influenced 
        the direction of the United States;
            (2) collaboration with other Smithsonian Institution 
        museums and facilities, outside museums, and educational 
        institutions; and
            (3) the creation of exhibitions and programs that recognize 
        diverse perspectives on women's history and contributions.

SEC. 4. COUNCIL.
