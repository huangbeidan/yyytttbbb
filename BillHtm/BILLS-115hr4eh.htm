SEC. 133. MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the 
        establishment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise 
        program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113), discrimination and 
        related barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for 
        minority- and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in 
        airport-related markets across the Nation. These continuing 
        barriers merit the continuation of the airport disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program.
            (2) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
        documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous 
        sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, 
        scientific reports, reports issued by public and private 
        agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by 
        organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits. 
        This testimony and documentation shows that race- and gender-
        neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address the problem.
            (3) This testimony and documentation demonstrates that 
        discrimination across the Nation poses a barrier to full and 
        fair participation in airport-related businesses of women 
        business owners and minority business owners in the racial 
        groups detailed in parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, and has impacted firm development and many aspects 
        of airport-related business in the public and private markets.
            (4) This testimony and documentation provides a strong 
        basis that there is a compelling need for the continuation of 
        the airport disadvantaged business enterprise program and the 
        airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprise program 
        to address race and gender discrimination in airport-related 
        business.

SEC. 599D. SPACEPORTS.

    (a) Sense of Congress on State Spaceport Contributions.--It is the 
Sense of Congress that--
            (1) State government-owned and -operated spaceports have 
        contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure 
        improvements to the national space launch infrastructure, 
        providing the United States Government and commercial customers 
        with world-class space launch and processing infrastructure 
        that is necessary to support continued American leadership in 
        space;
            (2) State spaceports play a critical role in providing 
        resiliency and redundancy in the national launch infrastructure 
        to support national security and civil government capabilities, 
        and should be recognized as a critical infrastructure in 
        Federal strategy and planning;
            (3) continued State and local government investments at 
        Federal and non-Federal launch facilities should be encouraged 
        and to the maximum extent practicable supported in Federal 
        policies, planning and infrastructure investment 
        considerations, including through Federal-State partnerships;
            (4) there is currently no Federal infrastructure investment 
        program funding or encouraging State and local government 
        investment in spaceport infrastructure, unlike Federal grant 
        programs to encourage continued investment in all other modes 
        of transportation, including aviation, highways, ports, and 
        rail, which limits opportunities for the Federal government to 
        leverage and coordinate infrastructure investments with State 
        and local governments;
            (5) Federal investments in space infrastructure should 
        enable partnerships between Federal agencies with state 
        spaceports to modernize and enable expanded 21st century space 
        transportation infrastructure, especially multi-modal networks 
        needed for robust space transportation that support national 
        security, civil, and commercial launch customers; and
            (6) States that have made investments to build, maintain, 
        operate, and improve capabilities for national security, civil, 
        and commercial customers should be commended for their 
        infrastructure contributions to both Federal and non-Federal 
        launch sites, and encouraged through a variety of programs and 
        policies to continue these investments in the national 
        interest.
    (b) Establishment of Office of Spaceports.--
            (1) Establishment of office of spaceports.--Title 51, 
        United States Code, is amended by adding at the end of subtitle

    (c) Report on National Spaceports Policy.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) A robust network of space transportation 
                infrastructure, including spaceports licensed by the 
                Federal Aviation Administration, is vital to the growth 
                of the domestic space industry and America's 
                competitiveness and access to space.
                    (B) Non-Federal spaceports licensed by the Federal 
                Aviation Administration have significantly increased 
                the launch infrastructure of the United States through 
                significant investments by State and local governments, 
                which have encouraged greater private investment.
                    (C) These spaceports have led to the development of 
                a growing number of orbital and suborbital launch sites 
                that are available to the national security, civil, and 
                commercial space customers at minimal cost to the 
                Federal Government.
                    (D) The Federal Government, led by the Secretary of 
                Transportation, should seek to promote the growth, 
                resilience, and capabilities of this space 
                infrastructure through policies and through 
                partnerships with State and local governments.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of

                carrying out subparagraph (A), the President may not 
                determine that a loan is a duplication of assistance,
