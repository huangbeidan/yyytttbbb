        (2) through (5).
            ``(2) Direct payment for employee education loans.--A plan

        plan are made on behalf of the employee directly to the lender 
        or loan servicer of a qualified education loan (as defined in

        in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees 
        (within the meaning of section 414(q))).

        Secretary may prescribe) the number of employees utilizing the 
        plan, the number of employees eligible to participate in the 
        plan, and the terms of such plan.
            ``(5) Notice.--A plan meets the requirements of this
