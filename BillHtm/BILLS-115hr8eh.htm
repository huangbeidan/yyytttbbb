environmental protection, restoration, and enhancement, and fish and 
wildlife mitigation benefit all Americans, and because water resources 
development projects are critical to maintaining the country's economic

SEC. 113. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress plays a central role in identifying, 
        prioritizing, and authorizing vital water resources 
        infrastructure activities throughout the United States.
            (2) The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 
        (Public Law 113-121) established a new and transparent process 
        to review and prioritize the water resources development 
        activities of the Corps of Engineers with strong congressional 
        oversight.
            (3) Section 7001 of the Water Resources Reform and 
        Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2282d) requires the 
        Secretary to develop and submit to Congress each year a Report 
        to Congress on Future Water Resources Development and, as part 
        of the annual report process, to--
                    (A) publish a notice in the Federal Register that 
                requests from non-Federal interests proposed 
                feasibility studies and proposed modifications to 
                authorized water resources development projects and 
                feasibility studies for inclusion in the report; and
                    (B) review the proposals submitted and include in 
                the report those proposed feasibility studies and 
                proposed modifications that meet the criteria for 
                inclusion established under such section 7001.
            (4) Congress will use the information provided in the 
        annual Report to Congress on Future Water Resources Development 
        to determine authorization needs and priorities for purposes of 
        water resources development legislation.
            (5) To ensure that Congress can gain a thorough 
        understanding of the water resources development needs and 
        priorities of the United States, it is important that the 
        Secretary take sufficient steps to ensure that non-Federal 
        interests are made aware of the new annual report process, 
        including the need for non-Federal interests to submit 
        proposals during the Secretary's annual request for proposals 
        in order for such proposals to be eligible for consideration by 
        Congress.
    (b) Dissemination of Process Information.--The Secretary shall 
develop, support, and implement education and awareness efforts for 
non-Federal interests with respect to the annual Report to Congress on 
Future Water Resources Development required under section 7001 of the 
Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2282d), 
including efforts to--
            (1) develop and disseminate technical assistance materials, 
        seminars, and guidance on the annual process as it relates to 
        non-Federal interests;
            (2) provide written notice to local elected officials and 
        previous and potential non-Federal interests on the annual 
        process and on opportunities to address local water resources 
        challenges through the missions and authorities of the Corps of 
        Engineers;
            (3) issue guidance for non-Federal interests to assist such 
        interests in developing proposals for water resources 
        development projects that satisfy the requirements of such 
        section 7001; and
            (4) provide, at the request of a non-Federal interest, 
        assistance with researching and identifying existing project 
        authorizations and Corps of Engineers decision documents.

SEC. 114. NON-FEDERAL ENGAGEMENT AND REVIEW.

    (a) Public Notice.--
            (1) In general.--Prior to developing and issuing any new or 
        revised implementation guidance for a covered water resources

        that--
                    (A) informs potentially interested non-Federal 
                stakeholders of the Secretary's intent to develop and 
                issue such guidance; and
                    (B) provides an opportunity for interested non-
                Federal stakeholders to engage with, and provide input

        alternatives;
            (5) an analysis of the methodologies utilized by the 
        Federal Government in setting and applying discount rates for 
        benefit-cost analyses used in the formulation, evaluation, and
