    ``(m) Considerations for Modifications to Annual Catch Limit 
Requirements.--
            ``(1) Annual catch limit requirement for certain data-poor 
        fisheries.--Notwithstanding subsection (h)(6), in the case of a 
        stock of fish for which the total annual catch limit is 25 
        percent or more below the overfishing limit, a peer-reviewed 
        stock survey and stock assessment have not been performed 
        during the preceding 5 fishing years, and the stock is not 
        subject to overfishing, a Council may, after notifying the 
        Secretary, maintain the current annual catch limit for the 
        stock until a peer-reviewed stock survey and stock assessment 
        are conducted and the results are considered by the Council and 
        its scientific and statistical committee.
            ``(2) Consideration of ecosystem and economic impacts.--In 
        establishing annual catch limits a Council may, consistent with 
        subsection (h)(6), consider changes in an ecosystem and the 
        economic needs of the fishing communities.
            ``(3) Limitations to annual catch limit requirement for 
        special fisheries.--Notwithstanding subsection (h)(6), a 
        Council is not required to develop an annual catch limit for--
                    ``(A) an ecosystem-component species;
                    ``(B) a fishery for a species that has a life cycle 
                of approximately 1 year, unless the Secretary has 
                determined the fishery is subject to overfishing; or
                    ``(C) a stock for which--
                            ``(i) more than half of a single-year class 
                        will complete their life cycle in less than 18 
                        months; and
                            ``(ii) fishing mortality will have little 
                        impact on the stock.

                    ``(A) In general.--Each annual catch limit, 
                consistent with subsection (h)(6)--
                            ``(i) may take into account management 
                        measures under international agreements in 
                        which the United States participates; and

                        life-history characteristics of the species 
                        that are not subject to the jurisdiction of the 
                        Council.
                    ``(B) Exception to annual catch limit 
                requirement.--If fishery management activities by 
                another country with respect to fishing outside the 
                exclusive economic zone may hinder conservation efforts 
                by United States fishermen for a fish species for which 
                any of the recruitment, distribution, life history, or 
                fishing activities are transboundary, and for which 
                there is no informal transboundary agreement with that 
                country in effect, then--
                            ``(i) notwithstanding subsection (h)(6), no 
                        annual catch limit is required to be developed

                        developed by a Council for the species, the

                        that is not subject to the jurisdiction of the 
                        Council.
            ``(5) Authorization for multispecies complexes and 
        multiyear annual catch limits.--For purposes of subsection 
        (h)(6), a Council may establish--
                    ``(A) an annual catch limit for a stock complex;

                overfishing or depleted in the absence of conservation 
                and management measures.

        shall be construed as providing an exemption from the 
        requirements of section 301(a) of this Act.''.
    (b) Action by the Secretary.--Section 304 (16 U.S.C. 1854) is 
amended--

                access privilege program;
                    (B) recommending policies to address the inequities 
                identified in subparagraph (A); and
                    (C) identifying and recommending the different 
                factors and information a mixed-use fishery should 
                consider when designing, establishing, or maintaining a 
                limited access privilege program to mitigate any 
                inequities identified in subparagraph (A); and
            (2) submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a 
        report on the study under paragraph (1), including the

        submit, and the Secretary of Commerce may approve, for a mixed- 
        use fishery that is managed under a limited access system, a 
        limited access privilege program if such program was part of a 
        pending fishery management plan or plan amendment before the 
        date of enactment of this Act.
            (3) Mandatory review.--A Council that approves a limited 
        access privilege program under paragraph (2) shall, upon 
        issuance of the report required under subparagraph (a), review 
        and, to the extent practicable, revise the limited access 
        privilege program to be consistent with the recommendations of 
        the report or any subsequent statutory or regulatory 
        requirements designed to implement the recommendations of the 
        report.
            (4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section may be

    (a) In General.--Before the approval and issuance of an exempted 
fishing permit under section 600.745 of title 50, Code of Federal 
Regulations, or any successor regulation, the Secretary of Commerce 
shall--
            (1) direct a joint peer review of the application for the 
        exempted fishing permit by the appropriate regional fisheries 
        science center and State marine fisheries commission; and
            (2) certify that the Council or Federal agency with 
        jurisdiction over the affected fishery has determined that--
                    (A) the fishing activity to be conducted under the 
                proposed exempted fishing permit would not negatively 
                impact any management measures or conservation 
                objectives included within existing fishery management 
                plans or plan amendments;
                    (B) the social and economic impacts in both dollar 
                amounts and loss of fishing opportunities on all 
                participants in each sector of the fishery expected to 
                occur as a result of the proposed exempted fishing 
                permit would be minimal;
                    (C) the information that would be collected through 
                the fishing activity to be conducted under the proposed 
                exempted fishing permit will have a positive and direct 
                impact on the conservation, assessment, or management 
                of the fishery; and
                    (D) the Governor of each coastal State potentially 
                impacted by the proposed exempted fishing permit, as 
                determined by the Secretary, has been consulted on the 
                fishing activity to be conducted.
    (b) Clarification.--The Secretary may not issue an exempted fishing 
permit under section 600.745 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, 
or any successor regulation that--
            (1) establishes a limited access system as defined in 
        section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
        Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802);
            (2) is consistent with section 303A of such Act (16 U.S.C. 
        1853a); or
            (3) establishes a catch share program as defined in section 
        206(a) of this Act.
    (c) Savings Provision.--Except for subsection (b)(2), nothing in 
this section may be construed to affect an exempted fishing permit 
approved under section 600.745 of title 50, Code of Federal 
Regulations, before the date of enactment of this Act.

        funded in the prior 5-year period and the research and 
        management needs that were addressed by those projects.''; and
