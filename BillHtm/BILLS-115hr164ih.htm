SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The CDC estimates 20,000,000 new sexually transmitted 
        infections (STIs) occur each year in the United States, and 50 
        percent of sexually active Americans will contract a STI at 
        some point in their lives, the majority of which may be 
        asymptomatic for an extended amount of time.
            (2) Over 1,200,000 people in the United States are living 
        with HIV, and someone is infected with HIV in the United States 
        every 9.5 minutes.
            (3) HIV/AIDS and STIs are syndemics. HIV infection can 
        increase a person's risk for acquiring certain STIs, as well as 
        affect their frequency, severity, and healing time, while STIs 
        increase the risk of HIV transmission, impaired fertility, 
        reproductive tract cancer, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
            (4) Many common long-term and initially asymptomatic STIs 
        such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, inflammatory 
        pelvic disease, viral hepatitis, and HIV/AIDS remain 
        undiagnosed, or diagnosed at later stages, leading to increased 
        rates of mortality, morbidity, disability, and transmission.
            (5) In fact, the CDC estimates over 3.6 million Americans 
        are living with chronic hepatitis and most do not know they are 
        infected. Chronic hepatitis B can remain asymptomatic for years 
        and, left undiagnosed and untreated, can lead to serious 
        complications. Additionally, individuals infected with 
        hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at risk for chronic liver disease 
        or other HCV-related chronic diseases decades after infection.
            (6) Stigma, culture, language, lack of education, lack of 
        insurance, limited time, cost and resources in medical 
        settings, and an inaccurate perception of risk among 
        communities and providers all contribute to insufficient rates 
        of screening for HIV/AIDS and STIs.
            (7) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the 
        United States Preventive Services Task Force recognize 
        screening as an effective public health tool that allows 
        providers to administer treatment before symptoms develop and 
        implement interventions that will reduce the likelihood of HIV/
        AIDS and STI transmission and reduce the development of adverse 
        outcomes.
            (8) The CDC recommends that voluntary screening for HIV/
        AIDS be integrated into routine clinical care while preserving 
        patient confidentiality and the right of the patient to decline 
        testing and screening.
            (9) The CDC also recommends that all unvaccinated, 
        uninfected persons being evaluated for a STI should receive 
        hepatitis B vaccination. Furthermore, anti-HCV testing is 
        recommended for routine screening of asymptomatic persons based 
        on their risk for infection or based on a recognized exposure.
            (10) Inaccurate perceptions of risk among health care 
        providers and patients, misdiagnosis, ageism, generational 
        mind-sets, and biological factors have contributed to increased 
        rates in transmission and late detection of HIV/AIDS and STIs 
        over the past decade.
            (11) Health equity and disparities remain a significant 
        public health challenge, with the burden of HIV/AIDS and STIs 
        falling disproportionately on different populations.
            (12) Although African-Americans account for about 13 
        percent of the United States population, they account for 
        nearly half of all HIV/AIDS cases and infections and have 
        higher instances of mortality and morbidity for most STIs and 
        HIV/AIDS. Also, African-American women who have sex with men 
        account for the majority of HIV/AIDS infections among all women 
        in the United States.
            (13) HIV/AIDS continues to be most prevalent among men who 
        have sex with men (MSM). Continued support and increased 
        funding for community-based programs and behavioral 
        interventions that are culturally competent are key to reaching 
        MSM, especially young MSM of color.
            (14) Transgender persons are particularly vulnerable to 
        contracting HIV/AIDS and STIs due to high rates of survival sex 
        among trans-females, discrimination in education, employment, 
        and housing, and the absence of education and prevention 
        methods culturally relevant to the transgender community.
            (15) Health care providers must be properly educated to 
        treat groups, such as MSM, transgender persons, African-
        Americans, and Latinos who are disproportionately affected by 
        HIV/AIDS and other STIs, and also improve interventions for 
        groups that have been historically underrepresented in health 
        interventions for STIs, such as women who have sex with women, 
        individuals over the age of 50, Asian and Pacific Islander 
        Americans, Native Americans, and persons living with 
        disabilities.
            (16) Women living with mobility impairments often lack 
        access to screening for STIs and other women's health services 
        such as pelvic examinations and mammograms due to, among other 
        factors, the lack of provider awareness, experience, and access 
        to equipment.
            (17) All individuals engaging in oral, anal, or genital 
        sexual contact must have access to voluntary screening for HIV/
        AIDS and other STIs. Screening must be confidential, rapid, 
        accurate, and medically appropriate. Screening must be offered 
        regardless of age, race, class, sexual behavior, sexual 
        orientation, gender identity, or disability.
            (18) The Congress supports the goals of the National HIV/
        AIDS Strategy and, in particular, the goal of 90 percent of 
        individuals knowing their HIV/AIDS status.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            (1) Increase access, quality, and affordability for 
        voluntary and medically appropriate screening for HIV/AIDS and 
        other STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, viral 
        hepatitis, and human papillomavirus, for all persons engaging 
        in various forms of sexual activity, including oral, genital, 
        or anal sex.
            (2) Reduce the spread, morbidity, and mortality of HIV/AIDS 
        and other STIs.
            (3) Reduce the disproportionate incidence of HIV/AIDS and 
        other STIs in certain groups through early detection and 
        treatment and comprehensive education for health care 
        providers, centers, and communities.
            (4) Support the execution of other scientifically based 
        interventions that are culturally competent and age appropriate 
        and are proven to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS and other 
        STIs.

        legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet 
        the additional requirement imposed by the amendments made by 
        this section, the State plan shall not be regarded as failing 
        to comply with the requirements of such title solely on the 
        basis of its failure to meet this additional requirement before 
        the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the 
        close of the first regular session of the State legislature 
        that begins after the date of the enactment of this Act. For 
        purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State that 
        has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such session 
        shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the State 
        legislature.
