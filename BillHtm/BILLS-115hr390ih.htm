To provide for emergency relief to victims of genocide, crimes against 
 humanity, and war crimes in Iraq and Syria, to provide accountability 
       for perpetrators of these crimes, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency 
Relief and Accountability Act of 2017''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On March 17, 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry 
        stated, ``in my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide 
        against groups in areas under its control, including Yezidis, 
        Christians, and Shia Muslims . . . the United States will 
        strongly support efforts to collect, document, preserve, and 
        analyze the evidence of atrocities, and we will do all we can 
        to see that the perpetrators are held accountable''.
            (2) Secretary of State Kerry stated in the ``Atrocities 
        Prevention Report'', transmitted to Congress on March 17, 2016, 
        ``The Department of State has a longstanding commitment to 
        providing support for the urgent humanitarian needs of 
        conflict-affected populations in Iraq, Syria, and across the 
        world, including but not limited to members of ethnic and 
        religious minorities.''.
            (3) The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on 
        the Syrian Arab Republic stated in its February 3, 2016, 
        report, ``The Government has committed the crimes against 
        humanity of extermination, murder, rape or other forms of 
        sexual violence, torture, imprisonment, enforced disappearance 
        and other inhuman acts. Based on the same conduct, war crimes 
        have also been committed. Both Jabhat Al-Nusra and some anti-
        Government armed groups have committed the war crimes of 
        murder, cruel treatment, and torture.''.
            (4) The International Criminal Investigative Training 
        Assistance Program and the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial 
        Development Assistance and Training of the Department of 
        Justice have provided technical assistance to governmental 
        judicial and law enforcement entities in Iraq, including with 
        funding support from the Department of State.
            (5) There were an estimated 800,000 to 1,400,000 Christians 
        in Iraq in 2002, 500,000 in 2013, and less than 250,000 in 
        2015, according to the annual International Religious Freedom 
        Reports of the Department of State.
            (6) Although Christians were an estimated eight to 10 
        percent of the 21,000,000 person population of Syria in 2010, 
        ``media and other reports of Christians fleeing the country as 
        a result of the civil war suggest the Christian population is 
        now considerably lower'' as of 2015, according to the annual 
        International Religious Freedom Reports of the Department of 
        State.
            (7) The Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil (Iraq) is an 
        example of an entity that has not received funding from any 
        government and has been providing assistance to internally 
        displaced families of Yezidis, Muslims, and Christians, 
        including food, resettlement from tents to permanent housing, 
        and rent for Yezidis, medical care and education for Yezidis 
        and Muslims through clinics, schools, and a university that are 
        open to all, and some form of these types of assistance to all 
        of the estimated 10,500 internally displaced Christian 
        families, more than 70,000 people, in the greater Erbil region.
            (8) In fiscal year 2015, the United States Government 
        admitted to the United States through the United States Refugee 
        Admissions Program persons from Priority 2 groups of special 
        humanitarian concern, as designated by Congress, including--
                    (A) Jews, Evangelical Christians, Ukrainian 
                Catholics, and Ukrainian Orthodox, from the former 
                Soviet Union;
                    (B) Iraqis at risk because they were, or are, 
                employed in Iraq by the United States Government, a 
                media or nongovernmental organization headquartered in 
                the United States, or an organization or entity that 
                received funding from the United States Government, or 
                are related to someone who is, or was, so employed;
                    (C) religious minorities in Iran; and
                    (D) members of other groups designated by the 
                United States Government, including--
                            (i) former political prisoners, active 
                        members of persecuted religious minorities, 
                        human rights activists, and forced labor 
                        conscripts in Cuba;
                            (ii) minors in Honduras, El Salvador, and 
                        Guatemala;
                            (iii) ethnic minorities from Burma in 
                        Malaysia;
                            (iv) Bhutanese in Nepal; and
                            (v) Congolese in Rwanda.
            (9) Through the United States Refugee Admissions Program, 
        the United States Government--
                    (A) admitted 12,676 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year 
                2015, including at least 2,113 Christians and 213 
                Yezidis;
                    (B) admitted 9,880 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year

                    (C) admitted 1,682 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 
                2015, including at least 30 Christians; and
