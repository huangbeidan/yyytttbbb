    <overview>Subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy, and Trade,</overview>
    <paragraph paraId="0" speaker="">Comer, Bacon, and Schneider.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Good morning. I call this hearing to order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Thank you for all being here today as we assess how our 
Nation is doing at building out broadband services to our rural 
areas. And do not let lack of attendance here indicate to you 
in any way lack of interest. As Ranking Member Schneider and I 
were just saying, it is a very, very busy day and a lot of 
things going on this morning. So everybody, maybe more so than 
usual, is being pulled in multiple directions. But rest assured 
it is a very serious issue. And I am from a rural district and 
it is talked about every time I am back in the State of Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Chairman BLUM">As we have all witnessed in the last decade, modern 
communications technology has provided endless opportunities to 
small businesses, and particularly new and exciting ones to 
small firms located in rural America. The growth of the 
telecommunications industry and the advances in the way we 
communicate with each other in recent history has been nothing 
less than astonishing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Because of this rapid advancement, we have seen a 
revolution of sorts for small businesses as well. Small firms 
can communicate now with potential buyers around the world. 
Family farmers are using wireless technologies to monitor and 
maximize their crop production. Entrepreneurs can launch a 
website or an application from their living room or from just 
about anywhere. I own a small technology company and we sell 
around the world, and we could not do it without the internet. 
And with the use of now commonplace smartphones, we can accept 
payments from just about anywhere there is a wireless signal. 
Most importantly, these new technologies provide the gateway 
and opportunity for economic growth and job creation, 
particularly in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Chairman BLUM">One of the most important tools the internet offers to 
small business is the ability to access the national and global 
electronic marketplace. From 2005 to 2015, electronic commerce 
in the United States, also known as online sales, grew from 
$291 billion to $342 billion. It is an average increase of 15.3 
percent from 2012 to 2015. Phenomenal growth. And this will not 
slow down anytime soon; I am sure you would agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Our small businesses, particularly ones in rural areas, 
depend on new telecommunications technologies to compete across 
town and across the globe. Our witnesses today represent a 
critical part of the infrastructure that allows them to do just 
that. The Nation's small telecommunications providers are the 
ones that traditionally supply the bulk of broadband services 
to the most rural parts of America, and that is no easy task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Chairman BLUM">For instance, it is certainly worth the investment when you 
connect broadband to a densely populated urban area with homes, 
apartments, businesses, and people all converging in a 
relatively small area. It is not uncommon to have hundreds, if 
not thousands, of potential subscribers in a 1 square mile 
area. In rural areas, where family farms dot the landscape, 
acres and acres and acres apart from each other, in towns with 
populations of 300 representing the center of the community, 
the bang for the investment buck is not quite as large. 
Unfortunately, the simple geographic fact of population density 
has led to a rather large disparity of 39 percent of our rural 
Americans not having access to high-speed telecommunications 
capacity--39 percent--compared to only 4 percent of Americans 
who live in urban areas. We have been making progress over the 
past few years, but more needs to be done to put rural America 
on par with urban America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Chairman BLUM">This issue is a double-edged sword in that we have small 
telecommunications companies serving the greater rural, small 
business sector at large with no small responsibility. We here 
in Congress must ensure that our Federal Government's 
regulatory regime is supporting and fostering growth in the 
telecommunications industry, not penalizing and limiting it, as 
we have seen in recent years. We have a new administration and 
new leadership at the Federal Communications Commission, or the 
FCC as most of us know it by, and other regulatory bodies that 
have a significant say about how and when broadband services 
can be delivered to rural areas in the United States. And I 
remain hopeful for continued, positive change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    Again, I want to thank everyone for being here, 
particularly our panelists. And I now yield to our ranking 
member, Mr. Schneider, for his opening remarks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to welcome
the chairman of the overall Small Business Committee, Mr. 
Chabot. I'm pleased to join you both at this very important 
hearing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">Technology is a major contributor to the U.S. economy and 
the engine for modern American economic growth. Last year 
alone, the internet created 10.4 million jobs across all 50 
States and contributed to 6 percent of the total U.S. GDP, 1.2 
trillion dollars. At a time when technology holds the key to 
remaining competitive in a globalized economy, it is worrisome 
that the United States is ranked number 16 in the world in 
broadband access. Let me repeat that, the United States is 
ranked 16th in the world in broadband access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">For those of us fortunate enough to have access to 
broadband, we have seen the benefits of technology and how it 
affects our daily lives. From being able to make decisions 
based on real-time data, to being able to work remotely from 
any location, internet access has changed the face of business. 
Yet 34 million Americans still lack access to high-speed 
internet, 39 percent of which live in rural communities. This 
is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">Even though broadband subscriptions have progressively 
increased, rural and low-income community access is being 
outpaced by the rest of the country due to a lack of network 
deployment. Unfortunately, the digital divide may further widen 
without adequate support for broadband deployment. The truth is 
that expanding access in hard-to-reach and sparsely populated 
areas usually comes with a high price tag and significant 
challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">The government plays a large role in ensuring all Americans 
have access to 21st century technology, and that is why we are 
holding this hearing, to learn just how we in Congress can 
improve broadband adoption. Eliminating the digital divide will 
not only assist rural communities; it will help our Nation's 
job creators. By enabling small business access to the global 
electronic marketplace, we encourage job creation and 
innovation. Thus far, Federal loan and grant programs have 
helped rural communities gain access to high-speed internet, 
but we need to do more. Substantial and direct funding to 
improve broadband nationally is critical to enabling both small 
telecom carriers and small consumers to thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">In the wake of a larger infrastructure package, we have an 
enormous opportunity to upgrade America's digital blueprint. We 
must harness the potential of robust technologies and find the 
sweet spot between government oversight and technological 
advancements, all without hindering business opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">I look forward to today's discussion on improving broadband 
access in order to strengthen rural communities and small 
businesses. The insights gathered today will allow us to 
evaluate the performance of the FCC and supporting network 
deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">    I would like to thank all of the witnesses for being here 
today and providing us your insight. And with that I yield 
back. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Chairman BLUM">I would now like to explain opening
statements, how that works and timing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman BLUM">If Committee members have an opening statement prepared, I 
ask that it be submitted for the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Chairman BLUM">I would like to take a moment to explain once again the 
timing lights for you. You will each have 5 minutes to deliver 
your testimony. The light will start out as green. When you 
have 1 minute remaining, it will turn to yellow. And finally, 
at the end of your 5 minutes, it will turn to red. And we ask 
that you please try to the best of your ability adhere to that 
timeframe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Now I would like to introduce our distinguished panel 
today. Our first witness today is Mike Romano, Senior Vice 
President of Industry Affairs and Business Development for 
NTCA, the Rural Broadband Association. In his role, he directs 
public policy, government affairs, business opportunities, and 
community initiatives for the nearly 850 small rural 
telecommunications providers it serves. Mr. Romano previously 
worked with the Bingham McCutcheon Law Firm and has had a 
diverse range of position within the telecommunications 
industry, including Founding Vice President and General Counsel 
of GTT Communications, following a merger between Global 
Internetworking, Inc., and European Technologies and 
Telecommunications. He has also held various positions with 
America on Line and Level 3 Communications. Thank you for being 
here with us today, Mr. Romano.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Our next witness is Dave Osborn, CEO of VTX1 in 
Raymondville, Texas, testifying on behalf of the WTA, Advocates 
for Rural Broadband. Mr. Osborn has been in his current 
position for 12 years, prior to which he had already worked in 
the telecommunications industry, holding various positions with 
multiple companies for more than 4 decades. Mr. Osborn began 
his career in the industry in 1970 with Southwestern Bell in 
Dallas, Texas, eventually climbing the corporate ladder to find 
himself at AT&amp;amp;T's corporate headquarters in Morristown, New 
Jersey, in the mid-1980s. He is now at his current position at 
VTX1 and also sits on the board of directors of the WTA. Thank 
you for being here with us today, Mr. Osborn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Up next is Tim Donovan, Senior Vice President of 
Legislative Affairs for the Competitive Carriers Association, 
otherwise known as the CCA. We have a lot of acronyms in 
Washington, D.C., that is for sure. Mr. Donovan previously 
served as Manager of Government Affairs for the Direct 
Marketing Association, where he is responsible for supporting 
the advocacy goals of the direct marketing community. In his 
current capacity, Mr. Donovan is tasked with presenting the 
association's legislative advocacy before policymakers on 
issues impacting wireless telecommunications providers, 
including broadband deployment, universal service, access to 
spectrum, devices, broadband policy, roaming, and other issues 
that affect the policy of these carriers. Does everyone 
understand all of that? Thank you for being here with us today,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    And now I yield to Ranking Member Schneider for their 
introduction of our final witness.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">Thank you. It is my pleasure to introduce
Mr. Chris Allendorf. Mr. Allendorf has served as the vice 
president of external relations and general counsel for Jo-
Carroll Energy since 2015. Joe-Carroll Electric Cooperative is 
located in my home State of Illinois and was founded with the 
goal of bringing electricity to rural residents not reached by 
investor-owned utilities. Since then, the cooperative has 
transformed to meet the needs of rural communities in modern 
times by providing other essential services, including 
broadband internet. Mr. Allendorf has transitioned from 
corporate counsel to other roles in the cooperative. As general 
counsel, Mr. Allendorf oversees legal and regulatory matters 
involving the cooperative's three business areas: electric, 
natural gas, and broadband internet. Mr. Allendorf also 
oversees the cooperative's economic development initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">    Mr. Allendorf holds a B.S. degree from Western Illinois 
University and received his J.D. from Northern Illinois 
University in 2012. Mr. Allendorf is a lifelong resident of 
rural northwest Illinois. He also serves on the Board of the 
Galena Area Chamber of Commerce and the Tri-County Economic 
Development Alliance. Welcome, Mr. Allendorf.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Very good. Very good. Thank you, Mr.
Schneider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Chairman BLUM">And now I would like to recognize our first witness, Mike 
Romano, for 5 minutes.

   ASSOCIATION; CHRIS ALLENDORF, VICE PRESIDENT OF EXTERNAL 
  RELATIONS AND GENERAL COUNSEL, JO-CARROLL ENERGY, INC.(NFP)
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Schneider, and members of the Subcommittee for the chance to 
testify on the importance of rural broadband to the U.S. 
economy and how sound policies can promote the deployment and 
sustainability of broadband in rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">NTCA's 850 members are small businesses, most based in the 
rural communities they serve. They rose to the original 
challenge of unserved areas, answering the call and getting 
telephone service at the time to rural America. Today, these 
small businesses and cooperatives deliver cutting-edge 
broadband critical to the well-being of rural America, 
translating into economic development and job creation. And the 
payback of these investments comes in economic activity that 
accrues mostly to the benefit of urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Small rural carriers have led the charge in deploying 
future-proof networks, with 71 percent of their customers 
having access to 25 megabits down speed that the FCC has 
defined as the access standard today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">But there is much more to do. With the remaining customers 
being harder to reach and with many rural areas served by other 
providers suffering from an even greater lack of access and 
even where networks are built, the job is not done. It is not 
just about the one-time act of getting broadband out there; it 
makes little sense to declare victory if the service is too 
expensive or if the network cannot keep pace with consumer 
demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Unfortunately, the business of rural broadband is hardly a 
money-making proposition. Distance, density, and topography 
undercut the business case in rural America. This is why direct 
support from the High Cost Universal Service Fund is essential. 
Without sufficient USF, it is difficult, if not impossible, to 
justify rural broadband loans or to charge reasonable rates for 
rural service. USF is perhaps the best example of a public-
private partnership in the broadband space, having helped to 
justify construction loans and private network investments that 
total tens of billions of dollars today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">But the USF program has been badly damaged. While the FCC 
took much-needed steps to update the program last year, the 
reforms also revealed more clearly than ever how insufficient 
the Universal Service Fund is. A flat budget in place since 
2011 that is now enforced by a firm control will deny $173 
million in USF support for small rural carriers over the next 
12 months. That is $173 million for broadband investments 
already made, forcing them to respond by hiking rural consumer 
rates, cutting jobs, and slamming the brakes on future 
investments. The fact that the budget control changes 
unpredictably only further undermines their ability to borrow 
or invest in long-term network assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">A survey that NTCA just completed and that we will actually 
be releasing today indicates that two-thirds of our members are 
pulling back on investments because of this problem, 
translating potentially to hundreds of millions of dollars in 
suspended investments and possibly hundreds of thousands of 
rural Americans locked in at lower speeds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Tack on another $110 million in shortfalls to fund a 
support model the FCC developed last year and this translates 
to lower speeds, higher prices, and less broadband network 
expansion across 40 percent of the U.S. landmass. This outcome 
undermines the great progress that has been enabled and 
achieved by these small companies leveraging the universal 
service program to date. It is contrary to the universal 
service mandates of current law. Fortunately, 170 members of 
Congress, including members of this Subcommittee, have already 
expressed concern to the FCC about how this affects rural 
consumers and communities, particularly prices for rural 
broadband that can remain twice as high as what urban consumers 
and businesses pay, if not even higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">We hold out hope, just like our members do, in continuing 
to try to build where they can, that Congress and the FCC will 
work together to make sure the promise of last year's USF 
reforms will be realized by the millions of Americans who badly 
need them to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Given these impacts and the sustainability and 
effectiveness of the USF program is a top priority, but there 
are other issues of importance, too. For example, as 
policymakers consider promoting infrastructure deployment, 
streamlining and standardizing access to Federal lands would 
help greatly, especially for small businesses that lack the 
staff and resources to navigate multiple layers of Federal 
agency process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Right size regulation is important, too. A survey NTCA did 
in 2016 showed that our small business members have only 40 
employees on average, but face just under 600 hours of burden, 
73 workdays per year in Federal telecom regulatory reporting. 
We need to strike a better balance between heavy-handed 
regulation, and, on the other hand, a complete lack of rules of 
the road that could put important goals, like universal service 
and interconnection at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Finally, better compliance across Federal agencies with the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act could help, too. All too often, 
agencies undertake cursory RFA analyses that do not recognize 
the realities of operating as a small business. We see great 
promise in several bills that the Full House has taken up, and 
we are eager to see those bills provide the guidance necessary 
to improve the RFA process and result in savings for small 
companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">We look forward to working with you on these important 
public policy initiatives and building upon the many successes 
these small businesses have had to date in deploying broadband 
in rural America.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF DAVE OSBORN</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DAVE OSBORN">    I would like to recognize our next witness now, Mr. Osborn. 
You are recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Thank you, Chairman Blum, Ranking Member
Schneider, and members of the Subcommittee. I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify today on improving broadband deployment 
in rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">I am the chief executive officer for the VTX1 Companies, a 
rural telecommunications provider based in Raymondville, Texas. 
Detailed information on my company and my personal work history 
have been submitted with my written testimony. Today I am 
representing our national association, WTA, Advocates for Rural 
Broadband, on whose board of directors I serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">I intend to focus on three main areas where I think 
Congress can work with the regulators to facilitate broadband 
deployment in rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">First is universal service policy. Without the support we, 
and other rural telecom providers, receive from the Fund, our 
cooperative members would never be able to afford the services 
we provide. For many years, the FCC has tried to modernize the 
Universal Service Fund, first with the National Broadband Plan 
in 2010, which recommended freezing support at 2010 funding 
levels. These reform efforts culminated in a March 2016 order, 
which resulted in companies like ours seeing their support 
reduced because of a budget reflecting the 2010 funding levels. 
We believe this approach attacks the problem from the wrong 
angle. Instead of setting the goal for broadband in rural 
America and attempting to determine what it would cost, the FCC 
has set an outdated budget and essentially said, ``See what you 
can do with this.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Our Federal USF from last year is down approximately a half 
a million dollars, with greater reductions anticipated in light 
of the caps and constraints the FCC has placed on the high-cost 
fund. These Federal support reductions have reduced our capital 
expansion within our Valley Telephone service areas and slowed 
the conversation to fiber optic. It is important to upgrade our 
networks to fiber because a fiber network will have a service 
life several times that of a copper one and the maintenance 
costs of a fiber network are much less than with copper. 
Additionally, serving the needs of cellular carriers with their 
forthcoming 5G LTE traffic will be very important. Instead of 
caps and cuts, the USF high cost program needs at least an 
inflationary adjustment so that high-quality broadband can be 
pushed further into rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Second is streamlining our permitting processes for 
existing rights of way. Congress should review and reform the 
permitting process for access to Federal lands and other right-
of-ways. We wait several months and spend many thousands of 
dollars on projects for environmental, archaeological, and 
historical preservation reviews. Many have little value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">For example, in 2010, VTX1 received a Broadband Technology 
Opportunity Program, BTOP, grant to construct a fiber-optic 
infrastructure for our universities. Our shovel-ready project 
had to wait 9 months to get environmental approvals needed to 
bore underneath the gravel right-of-way along two U.S. Federal 
highways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Third, regulatory reporting burdens. We are concerned with 
the increased quantity of reporting obligations and burdens 
placed upon us involving regulatory reporting to the FCC, USAC, 
NECA, and other Federal agencies when the recovery of these 
costs has been capped. VTXI performed a detailed wage analysis 
in 2016 and found that we spend around 3,200 hours completing 
just the Federal reporting requirements placed upon us. This 
costs us about $100,000 a year in wages and another $50,000 a 
year in benefit costs alone, with none of these dollars being 
recovered by any Federal support. A copy of our spreadsheet and 
study with our wage analysis is attached to my written 
testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Our conclusions are straightforward. First, the high-cost 
fund component of Federal USF needs to continue in remote-
serving areas in the rural communities, as well as having a 
cost-of-living escalator to keep the fund viable during periods 
of inflation. An increase in high-cost fund money should be 
considered as well to speed up broadband deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Second, permitting timelines should be greatly reduced in 
areas and the long roads where the land has been previously and 
continuously disturbed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Third, regulatory reporting should be streamlined and 
limited to items that have a significant, measurable benefit to 
broadband deployment in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">    That concludes my testimony. I await your questions. Thank 
you.

    <opening>STATEMENT OF TIM DONOVAN</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">    Next, I would like to recognize Mr. Donovan, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Thank you, Chairman Blum, Ranking Member
Schneider, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for 
inviting me to testify about improving mobile broadband 
deployment in rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">This hearing is timely, Mr. Chairman, following the 
President's emphasis on rural broadband in your district 
yesterday. It is great to hear that you were able to join in 
person in 5G meetings at the White House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">CCA represents nearly 100 wireless carriers and nearly 150 
vendors and suppliers. The vast majority of CCA's members are 
small businesses whose employees are the same consumers that 
live and work in the communities they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Mobile broadband use continues to increase exponentially. 
Ericsson recently forecasted a greater than five time increase 
in mobile data consumption over the next 5 years. Yet, a 
persistent digital divide continues to plague certain rural 
areas, leaving a subset of the Nation trailing behind their 
urban counterparts on the road to 5G, including small 
businesses and entrepreneurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">As FCC Chairman Pai noted last week, we do not bemoan the 
digital divide because some people cannot play games like Candy 
Crush. Internet connectivity is vital to full participation in 
modern life, and as he articulated at the inaugural Rural 
Prosperity Task Force meeting, these policies are important for 
demonstrating that the Federal Government cares about rural 
America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Access to mobile broadband is not only a telecommunications 
issue; it is a jobs issue, an education issue, public health 
and safety issue, and an issue of America's competitiveness on 
the international stage. Simply put, the future of rural 
economic, and so, small business growth, and leading the world 
in 5G is directly tied to the availability of mobile broadband.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">CCA's members are proud to serve rural and remote parts of 
the country with the latest mobile broadband technologies. That 
means preserving and expanding 4G LTE today and upgrading to 
5G.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Policymakers can support rural broadband deployment through 
three key issues. First, the FCC plans to distribute nearly $5 
billion for mobile deployment over the next decade through the 
Mobility Fund. But before the final eligible areas are set, we 
need better data. The current data is not standardized, nor 
useful, for determining where coverage gaps persist. Carriers 
know this, Congress has recognized this, and the FCC's website 
even acknowledges it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">It boils down to coverage, and you know better than anyone 
else where in your district you have coverage and where you do 
not, but bad data means that your district could be ineligible 
for support through the Mobility Fund. And as an accurate 
coverage picture is developed, policymakers should ensure that 
the Fund is sized to preserve and expand mobile broadband 
ubiquitously and ultimately meet Congress's mandate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Second, carriers must navigate a regulatory maze to deploy 
broadband infrastructure, meaning the towers, base stations, 
antennas, and wires, that are the skeleton for mobile service. 
It is critical to support carriers' abilities to expand and 
densify their networks for uses like precision agriculture, an 
important technology for this Subcommittee; telework 
opportunities and economic growth for America's small 
employers. Yet the obstacles continue to multiply. In fact, 
each step on the chart you have before you highlights potential 
costs and delays for businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">The bottom line is this: if we want to expand broadband 
throughout rural America and connect small entrepreneurs to the 
global economy, siting processes must be streamlined at the 
local, State, and Federal Government levels. The same 
regulations for 400-foot towers should not apply to modern 
small cells.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">This Committee should be a leader to ensure that policies 
enhance small businesses who have limited resources. To that 
end, the FCC deserves credit for establishing the Broadband 
Deployment Advisory Committee in which CCA participants. This 
stakeholder group should work alongside Congress to produce 
uniform policies that advance infrastructure deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Finally, spectrum is the lifeblood of wireless networks, 
meaning that carriers must have access to low-, mid-, and high-
frequency bands. In addition to deploying physical cells, 
carriers can enhance their network capacity by adding to their 
spectrum portfolios. The FCC recently completed the first-ever 
incentive auction where carriers bid nearly $20 billion for 600 
megahertz band spectrum voluntarily relinquished by 
broadcasters. Around 30 of the winning bidders are CCA members. 
Now, the FCC must act expeditiously to repack the band and make 
the spectrum available to the winning carriers so they can put 
their investment to use now and certainly before the 39-month 
transition deadline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Carriers need greater access to spectrum at all frequencies 
to continue to innovate and invest in mobile solutions. While 
low-band spectrum is necessary to address network coverage 
gaps, especially in rural America, the capacity needed for 5G 
and next generation technologies, which will be the foundation 
for transformative services, requires the use of mid- and high-
band spectrum resources as well. Small businesses in rural 
American can no longer afford to be on the fringe of the 
industry's shift to next generation networks, and policymakers 
are at the helm of this transition and can ensure that 
consumers in unserved and underserved areas are part of the 5G 
world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Policies established by Congress and implemented by the FCC 
determine whether small businesses in rural America have access 
to the latest services or are left behind modern mobile 
economy. Competitive carriers want to be part of the solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">    Thank you again for holding today's hearing. And I welcome 
any questions.

    <opening>STATEMENT OF CHRIS ALLENDORF</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="CHRIS ALLENDORF">    I now recognize Mr. Allendorf for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ALLENDORF</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Schneider, and members of the Committee, for the opportunity to 
address you regarding Jo-Carroll Energy's experience with rural 
broadband deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">Our company was founded as an electric cooperative in 1939 
as a result of the Rural Electrification Act. Today, we are a 
natural gas, broadband, and electric cooperative serving 
thousands of rural accounts across northwest Illinois. We are 
part of a broader electric cooperative industry that serves 
more than 40 million members nationwide over lines that cover 
more than half of our Nation. Most of these members and lines 
are in rural America. Rural utility cooperatives are not-for-
profit, private businesses that operate under democratic 
principles serving our members at cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">The goal of the REA was to bring electricity to rural 
Americans to ensure they enjoyed the same quality of life as 
those in urban areas when others could not see a business case 
to do so. There is a similar situation happening right now with 
broadband in rural America. We serve fewer customers spread out 
over greater distances than more urban investor-owned 
utilities. Low customer density is important to keep in mind 
when considering large scale deployment of broadband in rural 
America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">In 2009, Jo-Carroll began providing internet access to our 
members from a fixed wireless broadband system that we were 
utilizing for our electric and gas operations. Our hope was to 
bring higher speed broadband to rural subscribers than what was 
available, if anything, by leveraging our existing 
infrastructure. Our topography is challenging. We cover the 
highest terrain in Illinois down to river basins and all of it 
through dense forests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">We have not been able to reach as many people as we had 
hoped or offer the speeds that they need. Later, we transferred 
our internal network to fiber due to the need for reliable, 
high speed broadband for our utility operations. Fiber provided 
low latency and consistent high speeds unaffected by our 
topography. Most importantly for us, it is scalable to meet our 
future utility demands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">We sought to provide the same benefits to our members. Cost 
prohibited us from rolling out fiber to our entire service 
area, so we identified Galena, Illinois, as an ideal site for a 
fiber pilot project. It is a rural town of 3,500 amid farmland 
near the Mississippi. It is the second-most visited tourist 
attraction in Illinois after Chicago. That has created a robust 
hospitality and retail sector. Galena faces the same challenges 
as other rural areas regarding access to broadband. Service was 
only provided by cable companies or telcos over aging copper 
lines. Speed and reliability were big issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">Completed in 2016, our fiber project utilized existing 
overhead and underground utility infrastructure. Our take rate 
is over 60 percent among businesses in the project area. I have 
provided a few testimonials, but in summary, fiber has allowed 
businesses in the area to be more productive, more efficient, 
and increase sales; therefore, creating the potential to expand 
their business. It is now common to see merchants in Galena 
using mobile Bill Pay and other productivity applications which 
were not options before fiber broadband.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">For rural residents, high-speed broadband is not just about 
pastimes like Netflix, but more importantly, it is about a 
chance at a better living. Small businesses and farms are able 
to engage in commerce beyond their local area, which is a 
necessity in our global economy. It means rural students have 
the same access to high-quality education as their urban peers. 
It is critical for rural hospitals and clinics to provide 
modern patient care, and with experience in economic 
development, I can say it is one of the first things that 
businesses look at when deciding to locate in our area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">Studies have shown that greater broadband connection in 
rural areas result in higher income and lower unemployment. 
Without reliable broadband, these businesses and farms are at a 
competitive disadvantage. It has become as much of a necessity 
as the gas and electric services that we provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">The President's stated goal of a large infrastructure 
program is laudable, but we need broadband as much, if not 
more, than roads and bridges in rural America. Rural broadband 
access needs a place of special importance in these 
discussions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">Chairman Pai comes from a small Kansas town, and he has 
stated that government needs to rewrite regulations to cut red 
tape. He has created the Broadband Deployment Committee 
presumably to do just that. As you consider proposals to spur 
broadband deployment, we believe that all potential providers, 
including electric cooperatives, should be eligible to 
participate in open and inclusive processes to compete for 
funding opportunities. We urge policymakers to consider the 
scope of capital needed to bring broadband to rural America. 
Along with our density challenges, access to capital is a major 
issues for a small company like us. We need more grant funding 
to make large-scale deployment viable in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">Bringing electricity to rural America was a task of epic 
proportion and our success in doing so has been called one of 
America's greatest achievements over the last 80 years. The 
government created a strong, lasting partnership with rural 
cooperatives to accomplish that goal, which resulted in the 
same high quality of life for all Americans, regardless of 
economics and location. Jo-Carroll has seen that broadband 
access is essential for the continued success and well-being of 
rural America. It is our hope that Congress and this 
administration will build upon that partnership with support 
for the no less audacious goal of providing rural Americans 
with access to broadband service.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Thank you, Mr. Allendorf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Chairman BLUM">I am going to recognize myself for 5 minutes of questions 
and answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    The first question I have is, anyone on the panel can jump 
in, but as a technological, somewhat neophyte, I am continually 
amazed at the capacity of the system or the pipeline--I do not 
know if I am using the right terms. I live in a rural area and 
we have Netflix, we have Hulu, we have some of these other 
downloadable, on-demand services coming via the pipeline out 
there. My question is, reaching the capacity of what it can 
handle, is that an issue that we are bumping up against 
continually? And the second part of the question is, is it an 
even bigger issue in rural areas, this capacity, as more people 
want to download TV services like Netflix and Hulu? Whoever 
wants to jump in. And please keep it in terms I can understand.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. ROMANO"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will take a first
crack at that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> Is your microphone on?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. ROMANO"> It should be. It is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> All right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. ROMANO"> There we go. So thank you. So the challenge we
face is there is this tension between getting service to areas 
that are unserved and making sure that services are sufficient 
and robust enough to meet the challenges of broadband over the 
long haul. And that is a tension. It is a tough choice. It is 
not an easy one for policymakers or industry to work through. 
However, I think what you raise is a good point. As we are 
looking at this as an infrastructure challenge, one of the 
things we have to think about is building--these are assets 
that are intended to last for decades. And so if I were 
building a road and I had anticipated a level of traffic that 
was going to be coming across that road over the life of that 
asset, I would not build it as a two-lane road and then a few 
years come back and make it a four-lane road, then an eight-
lane road. I would have to go through all the permitting that 
CCA's chart I think demonstrates well, all over again. You 
would have to go through all these different challenges. So 
building a network upfront for anticipated demand over the life 
of that asset, we would submit, represents the most efficient 
use of resources to handle the kinds of capacity demands that 
you are expecting both now and into the future. Designing a 
network for 10-1, for example, when you know that just a few 
years ago it was 4-1 was the speed that was used and today is 
25-3 going to 100 megabits or a gigabit worth of speed and 
capacity over the use of that network, that sort of challenge 
is something that you have to engineer a network for up front 
to handle not only video and Netflix and things like that, but 
distance learning, telemedicine, all these applications that 
depend upon a robust network to make sure that you are going to 
attract healthcare, education, high commerce businesses to 
these communities.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> In your analogy, it probably makes it
tougher because that eight-lane highway you mentioned has not 
been invented yet. So you have to design a system, if you are 
trying to design it for 15 years from now and things have not 
even been invented that are going to be here 10 years from now, 
7 years from now, 12 years from now, correct? I mean, it is a 
heck of a challenge.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. ROMANO"> It is. It is. One of the benefits, I think, of
some of the systems we are moving towards with both fiber and 
5G, which I see as actually very integrated pieces of the 
puzzle because 5G is driven in large part, the capacity of the 
promise of 5G is driven by a densified fiber network. If you 
have fiber and you are moving towards 5G, you are starting to 
build for the ability to adjust, upgrade the network, scale it 
over time to respond to the kinds of demands. So you may not 
have invented that electronics yet that will deliver the speeds 
that we might see in the future, but you have at least laid the 
groundwork, the foundation to scale it for the things that 
might come to be in the best position to answer those calls.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ALLENDORF</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF"> Yes, Mr. Chairman. We need fiber as a
building block to all of these technologies that are being 
talked about today, like 5G. Rural areas simply do not have the 
infrastructure to utilize these technologies, like 5G. And as 
we have seen firsthand, we need a robust fiber infrastructure 
to, as Mr. Romano made the analogy, plan for the future and be 
able to handle the demands that will come from that. We have 
seen that firsthand.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> The future is fiber? Is it ever going to get
to the point where we do not need something buried under the 
ground? Where we do not even need the fiber? Or is that, well--
--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ALLENDORF</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF"> It is hard to imagine that, but----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> It is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ALLENDORF</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF"> The future is, in part, built on fiber. I
will say that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">The consumer is not going to plug into
something is where the future is going. The delivery vehicle is 
going to be wireless. And to add capacity to wireless network 
it is twofold. It is building more towers, and that is where 
all of the challenges and red tape in deploying the 
infrastructure are a big issue, but it is also adding spectrum 
to your network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">    And for your question on rural areas specifically, that is 
why this incentive auction spectrum is so important. It covers 
a very long distance. Think wherever you could pick up a 
broadcast TV signal, that is the same bandwidth that has been 
repurposed for wireless use. That is going to be 5G in rural 
areas. We need to make sure that carriers that bid and won that 
spectrum can put it to use to serve your constituents.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> How much was raised in that auction?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> Nearly $20 billion. So about $10 billion of
that goes to the Treasury for deficit reduction. About $12 
billion went to the broadcasters to compensate them for moving 
off the spectrum.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Chairman BLUM">You just answered my next question. Thank
you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    My time is up. And, oh, go ahead, Mr. Osborn.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">I was just going to make a point. You mentioned
what do you do when you run out of bandwidth? At any given time 
of day, we run between 40 and 50 percent of our traffic is 
either Netflix or Amazon Prime. The internet is not about email 
anymore; it is about video. And video takes massive amounts of 
bandwidth, particularly when everyone does it at the same time. 
We buy more. We have between three and five upstream tier one 
internet providers that we connect to so that we are never 
down, but we are selling 10 times what we did 5 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">When I took this job in 2005, a meg and a half of internet 
was a big deal. That was big stuff. We offer gigabit service in 
our fiber exchanges. That is a thousandfold and they are 
talking petabyte for fiber in 2020, and I thought, wait a 
minute, something is missing. Terabyte. What happened to 
terabyte? They are skipping that. So this 25-3, my god, we can 
do that with a tin can and a string.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">It is fiber. Fiber. The capacities of fiber are unknown. 
You ask any engineer and they will tell you they do not know 
what the capacities are; they are that vast. Wireless is 
applied physics, and when you take that down and say no matter 
how fast the wireless go, theoretically, the fiber will always 
go faster. So we see it as both. We offer fixed wireless 
service, and we can give up to 50 megabits on wireless with a 
dish on top of your roof. But we see it as the future of both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">    We need the wireless to reach customers that it is not 
economical to build to, and they need us to transport these 
huge amounts of data because 5G LTE is going to have, depending 
on how far you are from the tower, up to a gigabyte worth of 
service. That is huge. Absolutely huge.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Tin can and a string. Now it is something I
can understand. Thank you for bringing it down to my level and 
probably a few folks out there as well. Thank you so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    I would now like to recognize our ranking member, Mr. 
Schneider, from Illinois. You have 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">Thank you. And again, thank you to the
witnesses for our insightful testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">Mr. Romano, you used the term that I want to focus on a 
little bit which is future proof, because the rate of 
technology is changing, and Mr. Osborn, you just touched on 
something. There is a leapfrog effect. Well, it is not really a 
leapfrog. Going from mega to giga to peta, skipping tera. Just 
the pace is so fast. Fiber is a connection, but we need to have 
the ability to keep it up to date across the rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">    We're talking 5G. What is the life expectancy of each 
generation? Because we've already gone through 1, 2, 3, and 4G?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Yeah. This is the thing, especially, both on
the wireline and the wireless side, I think we are seeing 
massive amounts of disruption and the technology, the 
electronics change, the uses of the spectrum change in a way 
that could not be predicted years ago. I mean, think about it. 
You know, 15 years ago, actually, I worked at America On Line. 
AOL used to get those disks, right? I mean, things moved by DVD 
and CD at that point. Now we are moving at a pace that is 
unimaginable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">    But I think to your question, we cannot anticipate exactly 
what will come, but I know that 5G--we have not even seen what 
5G is yet. The standards for it are still being developed. 
People are talking about deploying 5G. They are kind of 
guessing and marketing what 5G is, but we actually do not know 
what those standards are. The best thing we can do is get 
networks into place that are scalable. If we have a limited, 
finite pool of resources, what is the best use we can make of 
those resources? We could try to spread them thinly and hope 
that the networks we build will keep up, or we could try to 
think through how do we make the best use of these so that over 
time those networks where they are built, they are not just 
there for the one time act of getting broadband there; it is 
keeping it there and keeping it useful and enabling 5G, 
enabling terabyte service, and greater over time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER"> Real briefly, just because we're so tight on
time, Mr. Donovan, you used a word that caught my attention 
which is densify. As we move to these next generations, does it 
mean that we are going to have to increasingly densify the 
modular parts of the networks, the towers, everything else?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> Yes. So thank you for the question.
Densification means bringing the transmitters for the wireless 
network closer to where the users are. So it is a lot fewer of 
the 400-, 500-foot towers and more and more cell sites that 
are, you know, about this big that you could put up on the side 
of a building, on existing light poles, and using existing 
infrastructure. That is what is going to be a big part of 5G, 
to fill up on kind of the generational shifts in wireless 
technology. You know, 5G is not a replacement for 4G services, 
and that is why it is so important that we have a base layer of 
4G rolled out today while industry is still working on the 
standards for 5G. In rural areas, there are still 2G networks 
that are operational because people are still using those. So 
it is not that one technology replaces the other; it is that we 
keep evolving and adding on top. And it is important for rural 
America to keep up with their Gs if we want to keep giving them 
the latest services.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">And let me just add to that as we broadly
think about rural America. It is the breadbasket of our 
country. It provides a vast quantity of our food. It is where 
we are developing new technologies. It's not that these are 
backwaters. It defines who we are as a country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">    And Mr. Allendorf, I want to turn to you because you grew 
up where you work. You've seen the impact of broadband. Can you 
tell us a little bit about some of the effects you've seen and 
the opportunities created by bringing broadband to a community 
like where you live?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ALLENDORF</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">I did not have experience with broadband
until I went to college in the early 2000s. Before that we had 
dial-up. And so getting to college and seeing what broadband 
can do for the first time was pretty eye-opening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">    What we have seen is, anecdotally, businesses are able to 
do more with the resources they have at hand. They are able to 
utilize productivity software, like I mentioned. It has really 
enabled them to truly compete in a global economy. You know, 
they do not have to drive to the nearest really good site for a 
broadband connection to transact business or something like 
that. And it has just increased their productivity overall. And 
so the effects that we have seen, especially in our fiber pilot 
project area are immense compared to what was there before. And 
I would say that they did not know what they had until they had 
it because it was not an option before. And now that they do 
they are finding new and creative ways to be more productive.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">As my time winds down, not having broadband
until college, I will tell you I got to college with card 
decks. So you can overcome these challenges in life. But that 
is the rate of our technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">I will also share that I, early in my career, worked on 
developing software, initially for the oil and gas industry. We 
migrated it to agriculture into these rural communities. This 
was back in the 1980s. We saw the revolutionary impact it was 
having then. Today, with broadband, as you well know, these 
communities, to be able to bring technology for agriculture, 
for medicine, for education, distance learning, the future is 
unlimited. But it cannot be unlimited unless we provide the 
resources to these communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">    So thank you very much. And with that I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    Now I would like to recognize the gentleman from Kentucky, 
Mr. Comer, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. COMER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. COMER">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. COMER">I represent a very rural district in Kentucky. It is a very 
poor district. We have a very high Medicaid population. I want 
to see people get off Medicaid and get into the workforce. To 
do that in my rural district, we are going to have to create an 
environment where we can attract better paying jobs that 
provide benefits. One of the biggest issues for me as a 
freshman member of Congress is to try to help improve broadband 
in my rural district, so I am very interested in this subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. COMER">    Mr. Allendorf, since your primary focus has been delivering 
electricity, can you talk a little bit about the regulatory 
obstacles that other folks on the panel may not have when 
building out their broadband capacity? Because we are going to 
have to do that I would assume through the electric 
cooperatives and the rural electric cooperatives in our 
district.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ALLENDORF</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">First let me say that with our fiber
project, we were able to utilize existing infrastructure much 
more than we were with fixed wireless solutions. So it requires 
less permitting, which is always a concern, both locally and 
from the State. So being able to use our overhead and 
underground infrastructure is a huge benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">    Regulatory challenges we face, pole attachments, something 
that always comes up, that is an issue. There is a Federal case 
out of Missouri that dealt with pole attachments for fiber use 
by a cooperative. I believe that is currently on appeal. We are 
anxiously waiting to see what the result of that is to see what 
barriers there may be going forward to deploying broadband over 
our existing infrastructure.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. COMER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. COMER"> Okay. Mr. Donovan, what kinds of reforms could
help alter the outlook for a company interested in deploying 
broadband?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Thank you for the question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">    You know, in Kentucky, carriers like Bluegrass Wireless and 
Appalachian Wireless----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. COMER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. COMER"> My cellular carrier.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">That is a great company out of Elizabethtown
there. We are proud to have them as a member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">One challenge that wireless carriers are facing now is the 
FCC's mobility fund has a lot of opportunity in making 
resources available to make that last piece, the economic case, 
to serve these rural areas. The biggest problem we have right 
now is the data. The map that they show on their website 
overstates coverage. And you have to take my word for it. It 
says at the bottom, ``These coverage calculations have certain 
limitations that result in overstatement of the extent of 
mobile coverage.'' Looking at it quickly, it looks like all of 
Iowa, most of Illinois, most of Kentucky, on down the line, are 
fully served. I think you know that is probably not the case or 
else we would not be here today talking about how we can get 
service out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">    Before we decide how $5 billion is going to be spent over 
the next decade and lock those areas out, we need to make sure 
that we are acting on sound data so that the unserved parts of 
your district are eligible to bid in that auction and gain 
support.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. COMER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. COMER"> If Congress moves on an infrastructure bill with
money for broadband, should that money go through the high-cost 
fund or through other programs or agencies such as RUS or NTI?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> So we have structures that are put in place
through the FCC, like the Mobility Fund. I think there is 
unanimous agreement of the panel that USF is not fully funded 
today, so this could be a great opportunity to plus that up. 
The thing to also consider is making sure that however the 
funds go out, that carriers that are receiving those can have 
some long-term certainty that those are going to be available, 
that you are not subjected to some of the fits and starts of 
the appropriations process moving forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. COMER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. COMER">Okay. Very good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. COMER">    Mr. Romano, one last question here for you. Would it be 
better to get everybody connected even if it is at lower 
speeds? Or should we focus on the future and invest more in 
developed technology? What is the right balance on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. ROMANO"> Thank you, Mr. Comer. That is the challenge
that we face, as I mentioned earlier, the tension that we face 
between trying to get as many of the unserved covered as 
possible. However, if you are building a dirt road to everybody 
when you think you are going to have a lot of traffic there, 
you are potentially wasting resources. So we think it is best 
to try to strike a balance where you look to get the most 
future proof networks you can. Aim for the highest networks you 
can to as many people as possible. It may take a little bit of 
time, but the more we build for the future, the more we are 
going to attract the kinds of jobs and businesses that you were 
talking about. Somebody is not going to relocate a plant to a 
district connected to DSL.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. COMER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. COMER"> Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Thank you, Mr. Comer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    I would now like to recognize for 5 minutes the gentleman 
from Missouri, Mr. Luetkemeyer, who is also the Vice Chairman 
of our full Small Business Committee. You are recognized for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to
the guests who are here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">Like the other members of the Committee, I come from a 
very, very rural part of my State. In fact, I always tell 
people I live so far out that I am in the middle of nowhere, 
but when you get there you are finally somewhere. So when I 
have discussions with telecom companies, I always tell them, 
you know what? I live so far back, if you can get me broadband 
and that sort of stuff, then you come talk to me. Until then, I 
have got a lot of constituents who have got problems. If you 
cannot serve me and them, we do not need to talk. So this is a 
very, very important hearing, and I appreciate the chairman's 
indulgence here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">Also, in my county, our county seat sits right square in 
the middle of our county, and until about a year ago it did not 
even have cell phone service. Can you imagine that? We did not 
even have cell phone service in our county seat. So the 
sheriff, obviously, he had no ability to contact his deputies 
on a regular cell phone and had to find other ways to 
communicate with them with his other phones, which is fine, 
but, I mean, it just shows the difficulty that some of us in 
the rural parts of the country live through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">So I guess my question would be to each of you, what can we 
do as a Committee to help promote or do whatever we need to do 
to help all of you provide the broadband and the 
telecommunications services that our people, our businesses, 
our health providers in our part of the world need to be able 
to do their job and protect our citizens? And I guess the first 
question is how do you speed up the regulations? And I know 
more money is always added. But when you do that, I want to 
know how do you estimate the return on your investment? Because 
I can tell you, you know, I grew up a long, long time ago. I 
remember the old TV show, ``Get Smart.'' And the guy had a 
phone in his shoe and today I have got two phones sitting right 
here that when I grew up that was a fantasy. How can you have a 
phone without a line to connect it to the rest of the world? 
And yet today it is a convenience we cannot live without.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">So I understand the difficulty that you have in predicting 
the future, which you talked about, and how you make that 
investment, how you figure out that return investment. If you 
could kind of go into some of that, I would appreciate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">    And then I would like to go to Mr. Donovan, I believe, with 
regards to the data. So let me stop and let you answer some 
questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> Thank you. It sounds like the county seat
would be a perfect place for some small cells to go up on some 
of the existing poles build out service in there. The problem 
in these rural areas, as this Committee knows, is the margins 
are already very tight for small carriers to serve them. And 
the opportunity costs of fees that you pay to site them, 
especially on small cells, if it is the same fees you are 
paying to build a massive tower, it could be enough to make it 
so it is no longer economical to provide that service. So 
anything we can do to streamline the process to get some of 
those fees in line is going to help us be able to expand 
service in areas like that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Okay. How do you figure your return on
your investment? How do you work the numbers on that? Do you 
figure 5 years, 10 years, 15, 20, 25? What kind of timeframe do 
you look at when you figure out the return on your investment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> So it does vary carrier to carrier. One thing
that is exciting in the wireless world is that the future 
customers may not be, yourself sitting here with two phones, 
two lines of service, but it could be your tractor in the 
field, each head of cattle that is out there that is being 
remotely monitored, you know, there is a new internet of 
things, customers that are changing the equation that you do 
for your cost-benefit analysis, but that is only going to 
happen if we have the networks in place to support that. 
Otherwise, the investment is going to flow elsewhere. If you do 
not streamline how we can invest in those areas, then those 
areas are going to miss and it is going to go to places that it 
is easier to make those deployments.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Does anybody else want to comment? Mr.
Romano?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Yes. I will jump in. Thank you. Thank you,
Congressman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">    So I think the challenge, or one of the things I think the 
panel has in common actually, is we all represent or all are 
associated with community-based providers. So one of the things 
that is interesting when you look at ROIs, if you live in that 
community, if you are based in that community, you have a 
different view perhaps of ROI than if you are investing from 
far away because if you are investing from far away or you have 
allegiance or you have fiduciary duties to faraway 
shareholders, that creates a very different circumstance than 
when, you know, you have got to get your money out because you 
have got capital in. In this case, some of these loans these 
folks are taking out are 20-year loans, so, therefore, the ROI 
is very different. They are also, again, headquartered in the 
community. They might be cooperatives that actually their 
members are their owners.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">Okay. One more quick question before I
lose my time here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">    Mr. Donovan, you talked about the study to make sure that 
you have the data there to be able to make sure you disburse 
funds where it is needed. Number one, who does the study? And 
number two, who pays for it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> Thank you. So the data, it is required by the
FCC to be submitted by carriers. So far, so good. The problem 
is the FCC does not tell carriers how to standardize that data. 
So you could have one carrier that is reporting at a signal 
strength that varies dramatically from another carrier. The 
calculation that they do, we will not go into----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> So you need some better direction from the
FCC then on the reporting of this data, is that what you need?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> We need to make it standardized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">Standardized. Okay. Very good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Thank you, Mr. Luetkemeyer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    I now recognize the gentleman from the great State of Iowa 
for 5 minutes, Mr. King.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. KING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. KING">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding
this hearing and taking the lead on this issue. I was just 
listening to the remarks of my friend, the neighbor to the 
south, Mr. Luetkemeyer, whose district I have visited and he 
lives in the middle of nowhere and I live in the center of the 
hub of the wheel in the middle of nowhere. I have cell phone 
coverage; he does not. And so I am sitting here listening 
thinking why is that the case for me and not for Mr. 
Luetkemeyer and many of his constituents?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. KING">One is hills. The degree of difficulty is a lot greater if 
you have got hoops and valleys rather than the flatter 
countryside that predominates a lot of the great State of Iowa. 
That is part of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. KING">    But another part of it, I think, and I wanted to ask the 
question, whoever wants to volunteer to answer it, is that in 
Iowa we had, the last time I kept track, about 142 independent 
telcos. And I know that they are more personally connected with 
their customers than the more remote larger companies. And the 
map says that Iowa is in pretty good shape. There are 
exceptions there. Mr. Donovan, you pointed that out. But how 
much impact has it had to have a large number of competitive 
independent telcos that are neighborhood telephone companies 
using everything they can to make that pipe as big as possible 
for the long-term future of their neighbors and relatives?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">It is critically important, Congressman. And
like my colleague, Mr. Romano, mentioned, being in the 
community makes a difference as you make decisions about where 
you are going to invest and where you are going to serve. When 
you have to see your consumers, not just in the office when 
they come to your store, but in the grocery store and around 
the community. So that changes how you make your investment 
decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">    One success story in Iowa is that rural carriers like 
iWireless have been able to band together some of those 
smaller, independent operators so that you can have some scale, 
so that you can gain access to buy devices. If you do not get 
to some of those scale levels, like across many issues for 
small businesses, if you cannot deliver enough scale, then you 
cannot get access to economically priced resources that you 
need. For wireless service, that is the devices. It is the 
network infrastructure. It is the things you have to build to 
provide that service.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. KING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. KING">And so at least in my theory, if other States
were beneficiaries of a lot more competitive, a lot of times 
family-owned telcos, we might have seen a better buildout here 
on broadband.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. KING">    So the resources have been there for everybody equally? Was 
that true?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> Not always the case, unfortunately. In the
wireless world, so spectrum is our primary resource. You are 
not making any more of them. You need to get it from license 
from the government. Different spectrum bands are made 
available differently. One thing that is important for small 
businesses, if the license size is not sufficiently small for a 
small business to be able to bid on it, win it, and provide 
service, then they are not going to be able to get access to 
that critical resource and they will not be able to provide 
service.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. KING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. KING">And the license size applies. And then also the
ability to have the infrastructure built that can handle the 
capacity into the future. A narrative popped into my head when 
I heard that. As I recall, I had a construction office in town 
for a number of years and it was fed by a 3/4-inch water line 
underneath the highway, a very wide highway with a long boring 
project to replace it. I went to the city and said I cannot 
provide water out of my place to the blacksmith who is next 
door to me and he is trapped if I do not get it to him. We need 
to expand this water line. I made a powerful case they should 
do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. KING">I finally sold them on the idea and they let me go up to 1-
inch from 3/4. So I finally, out of frustration, said I will 
put the water line in, and I bought the 2-inch line and now 
everybody is living happily ever after on that one. That is how 
I equate with what you are talking about. Let's, well, 
overbuild this because the actual cost of the equipment is 
minimal in comparison to the cost of the labor to do the 
installation process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. KING">    I wanted to turn to Mr. Romano and give you an opportunity 
to say whatever you need to say, but I also have a question. I 
have some neighbors, and myself included, that use cell phone 
boosters in our homes. Is there a future for that or are they 
minimal in their ability to have impact?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">No, I think they will have impact. Wireless and
wired services are I think, in many respects, complementary 
both at the network level and the access level. You know, a lot 
of times you see people talk about how much mobile data 
consumption there is. People are using tablets more to connect 
to devices. A lot of times those mobile tablet devices are 
actually, in fact, hopping onto a wired network, a Wi-Fi 
network. These are complementary integrated networks that are 
going to need each other, I think, to thrive and survive and 
serve the needs of a community like you are talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">    I did want to come back to the one point you made about 
local community interest, ownership, family-owned businesses, 
cooperatives working together. We have actually started an 
initiative with a number of folks trying to get telcos and 
electric co-ops who have a shared interest in serving these 
communities together. Bring broadband expertise together with 
the assets, the community interest of the electric cooperatives 
and municipalities, and tribal entities even. Think about 
different ways of tackling these so we can make the most 
efficient, most effective use of resources on the ground level.

    <speaker>Mr. KING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. KING"> To anybody that wants to answer this, is it our
future that everybody in America eventually will have access, 
not only in the undefined broadband is for me, I did not hear 
that, but is there a future that we will be able to do 
livestream HD anywhere, anytime, for anybody with a cell phone 
or sitting in their home with their television? Is that where 
we are going to end up with an unlimited capacity beyond our 
imagination? Today, I should say, not unlimited, to go beyond 
that if need be?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. ROMANO"> It could be, but what you are going to need is
the small cell deployment that is robust enough, fed by fiber 
networks that are robust enough, and spectrum assets that are 
robust enough to hit those small cells. Again, while I say it 
is all integrated, but it could be there. But you are going to 
need those small cells every few hundred feet, which is a big 
challenge in rural America, with robust enough spectrum or 
fiber capacity behind them to feed the kind of demands that you 
are talking about. But that is the dream at least.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. KING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. KING">We can get there. And they would have loved to
have this on Apollo 13.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. KING">    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the hearing, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Thank you, Mr. King.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Chairman BLUM">I would like to start the second round of questioning, if I 
could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    Somebody mentioned having, I guess, transmitters on phone 
poles, telephone poles. It kind of reminds me of the concept of 
the democratization of electrical grid, that if each home in 
America, or particularly in rural America, could generate our 
own electricity, we could sell some of that electricity back to 
the power companies. In essence, we would be democratizing the 
electrical grid. This concept fascinates me. Could this 
possibly be an answer in rural America for wireless is to have 
every farm, every home, my home for example could not only 
receive, but could also maybe send, transmit to the next home--
not back to the tower, but to the next home--and we would have 
this interrelated network? Because I have heard of this very 
thing for aircraft. And if every aircraft that is in the air, 
we know their position, and if they can communicate with each 
other, then we have this grid. And so there would be no dark 
spots or black spots over the ocean, for example, that 
currently we cannot capture with radar. It fascinates me the 
concept. Could you comment on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> Absolutely, Mr. Chairman. And you are right,
that we are going to need the cell sites brought that close to 
you so you can have that kind of mesh network that does not 
have any gaps. The problem right now----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> Mesh network? Is that what that is called,
mesh network?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> That is. It is mesh networking. But right now
you probably are not going to go through the process to work 
with a carrier to put up a cell site on the side of your house 
if it means that you are going to have to do a new 
environmental review to see whether you disturbed anything when 
you built that house, to go through a new historical review. We 
need to cut through some of that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> Remove the word ``probably.''
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> Well, exactly. And that means that you will
not have that cell site available. So we need----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> Well, today, in today's environment. That is
what it would entail?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> That is right. You would have to go through
every step of this in order to put that cell site up on the 
side of your building.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Chairman BLUM"> But a fascinating concept nonetheless?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> Absolutely. And the densification that we need
to provide that service going forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Chairman BLUM">And my second and last question is for Mr.
Osborn. And Mr. Donovan just mentioned the regulations. 
Regulatory burden is a big topic in Washington, D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    I would like to ask you, Mr. Osborn, with the change in 
leadership at the FCC with Chairman Pai coming in, have you 
seen any indications that the FCC is serious about reducing the 
regulatory burden in this industry, particularly as it relates 
to rural areas?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Yes, we have. The first few months have been
very encouraging. What Chairman Pai seems to be very sensitive 
to is the red tape and the regulations. And I mentioned the 
permitting process that we were involved with, and understand 
there is a Bill S604 that would essentially give a categorical 
exclusion to environmentals along operational rights of way. 
That type of legislation would help quite a bit in removing 
some of the regulatory issues that I call environmental 
regulatory. But that would speed things up greatly, reduce 
cost, and I think make things more efficient in laying fiber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Once you lay fiber, it is there forever. We lay our fiber 
in double plow ducts, undisturbed. We go down as far as we can, 
6 feet, 8 feet if we can, and we run it. Once it is there, we 
can replace it without having to dig. So that investment, we 
can look at that as a 20-year rate of return. We have to 
replace the electronics every 3 to 5 years. So that is the one 
where we have got to get our money out of that quickly. The 
wireless, the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">So the rate of returns that we are trying to work toward 
varies largely by the technology. But the regulatory issues 
more faces with the terrestrial piece of it. I mentioned the 
reports that we have to do. If we saw value in this, I think it 
would be different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">    Mapping is a big part of our business. We have maps of 
everything in our serving area. It is about 10,000 square miles 
of serving areas. And to deal with the FCC's requirements to go 
down to the census block, I can show you those census blocks in 
my map. I should not have to do a separate report and 
essentially duplicate what I have paid hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for in a software system to come up with a report. I 
have the information; all they have to do is ask for it. And 
that would help greatly in terms of moving things along.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    I would now like to recognize the gentleman from the great 
State of Nebraska, Mr. Bacon, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. BACON">Thank you. I apologize for coming in just a
little bit late, but two other simultaneous meetings. So I am 
running around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. BACON">I used to be raised on a farm until 1985, joined the Air 
Force, but my main problem of getting some kind of linkage 
prior to 1985 was finding that AM radio so I could listen to 
the Chicago Cubs play at 120. In the military, too, we are 
starting to do every aircraft, you know, receiving and sending 
various links. And what has impressed me is now I am out of the 
Air Force and I am starting with the ag community again, and 
talking to my family, it is just so impressive that all the new 
combines, all the new tractors all have these links. Our 
irritation systems are doing the same. Just phenomenal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. BACON">    And you may have already mentioned this, and I may have 
missed it, so I apologize if you did, what is the actual scope 
of investment that we need nationwide to field this the way we 
want to? And I will just open it up to whoever can respond.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. OSBORN"> Thank you, Congressman. It is an evolving
level. We need to make sure we are keeping up with everything, 
but you hit on an important point. There has been a lot of talk 
in D.C. recently about connected cars. Well, on farms we have 
had those for a while. They are combines and they are tractors, 
but they are using those connections. So Cost Quest has done 
one model of what it would take to have wireless coverage 
across the country to power all those things and they came in 
at about $25 billion.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. BACON"> Twenty-five billion?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. OSBORN"> With a B. With about another billion in
operational costs once you have it built just to keep it going 
in areas that private capital will not sustain.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. BACON"> And that gives us the capability for all of our
newest equipment to be able to communicate with maintenance 
facilities? And so, I mean, all that networking that is going 
on. So you would get that capability. What other capability 
would that provide our agriculture?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. OSBORN"> So the combines, the tractors are connected.
You know their maintenance schedules. They tell you before they 
break down that you need to get someone out there. You can more 
efficiently use resources. You know, what fields need water? 
What needs what going on? But you also have real-time 
connections to markets and you know when it is time to harvest 
certain amounts of the yields. So your productivity goes up 
overall as well as profitability of the farm.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. BACON">Right. I think that is incredible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. BACON">    Are there certain portions for our country right now that 
need this more than others? Are there areas that are more 
advanced? Is there some portions of the country that were 
falling behind?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. OSBORN"> You know, I think for different use cases, we
need this nationwide. You probably are not going to be using a 
tractor on a mountain, but you still are going to want to be 
connected so you can take part in other educational and 
business opportunities.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. BACON">Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the
time. And I can just second the importance of it because my 
family that is still involved in the farming, when you go out 
there and they are using a GPS. I had the most curveous rows 
when I was a 16-year-old out there. Now you do not have to 
drive it at all. It is perfectly straight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. BACON">    Well, thank you so much. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Thank you, Mr. Bacon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    I now recognize our ranking member, Mr. Schneider, from 
Illinois, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">Thank you. And I will not be long and take
the full time. I just want to wrap up on a couple of things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">You do use tractors on a mountain. I grew up in Colorado. 
Ski areas are, seriously, using those for maintaining their 
slopes during the winter. So this is something that affects us 
all across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">And Mr. Donovan, I will go back to something else you said. 
You talked about the idea, the Internet of things they did. 
Every head of cattle will have a device that is sending back 
information about that individual cattle, which means their 
food will be healthier, our cost to produce that food will be 
lower, and the impact it has, again, across the whole Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">    So I really just want to give each of you a last chance for 
a reflective comment, perhaps. As we talk about providing rural 
communities with broadband access, which was the subject of 
this meeting, this is something that I believe really is of 
national interest. It don't affect just our rural communities; 
it affects all of us regardless of where we live. And so start 
with you, Mr. Romano, just a last word of why this is important 
to our Nation and why it deserves a national investment.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ROMANO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">Thank you, Congressman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">The Hudson Institute did a study a couple of years ago 
showing that the payback from investment in rural broadband, 
just from the active investment in rural broadband, not the 
follow-on effects of rural broadband, were $24.1 billion in 
2015 to the national economy with much of that accruing back to 
urban areas actually because of the vendors and contractors 
that are hired to build this stuff and the tower manufacturers 
and what have you. So there is that direct impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. ROMANO">    There is the indirect impact, of course, of the mission of 
universal service first sort of thought of last century and 
embodied in different forms throughout, but the network effect 
in our country is stronger and better and more efficient and 
effective if every American is connected. And that is one of 
the things that I think is important in the concept of 
universal service. We have a lot of folks who focus on let us 
connect this type of institution, this type of customer, this 
type of user. We need community-wide access to all of them. To 
focus on any one type of user and silo it in that way I think 
undercuts the notion of universal service. We should be asking 
the folks who are out there building to build to every user, 
irrespective of what kind of user they are, so that everybody 
gets the benefit of that network effect, which is why we are 
building these networks in the first place.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. OSBORN"> Thank you. Just a quick word on the Hudson
Institute study. It did not come as a great surprise to us 
because we have communities where it is an hour, hour and a 
half to the nearest Walmart, hour and a half to the nearest 
Best Buy, you name it. So boy, you can get on there to go to 
Amazon. Two days, right? And buy and purchase. So rather than 
run into town, people, that is how they do their commerce is 
get on that internet and make purchases. And that adds up.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER"> I am going to date myself. I used to work at
Sears Catalogue.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">Oh, my. You get it. You totally get it. You
totally get it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. OSBORN">    The other topic, though, you know, we are part of a world 
economy and somebody mentioned we are number 16. I think that 
is pitiful.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER"> That was me.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. OSBORN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. OSBORN"> Of course, number 1 through 15, the
telecommunications infrastructure is probably owned by the 
government. That is the common model. The U.S. is the exception 
to that with the formation of AT&amp;amp;T 100 years ago. If we are 
going to be competitive with India, with China, with the rest 
of the world, we are going to have to kick it up a notch and we 
are going to have to bite the bullet and put some money in it, 
not just in rural. But you are going to have to put the money 
everywhere and get us competitive. And it needs to flow out to 
the rural areas because they are doing some important stuff. 
That is where food, water, and oil come from that we need.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">Fair point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER">    Mr. Donovan?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">Well, I have to associate myself with my
colleague's comments on the economic impact. It is incredible 
to see what a multiplier it is bringing broadband services out 
to these areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN">    I guess Congress got it right, you know, directing the FCC 
that we will have policies for reasonable comparable----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER"> Will you just repeat that again?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DONOVAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. DONOVAN"> On Universal Service Fund, in 1996, Congress
got it right directing the FCC to have reasonably comparable 
services and an evolving standard in urban and rural areas. We 
need to make sure we are putting policies in place to make sure 
that that is the case on the ground.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER"> And the last word to you, Mr. Allendorf?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ALLENDORF</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">Thank you, Congressman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. ALLENDORF">    Building on Mr. Donovan's comments, Congress got it right 
with rural electrification as well. And it is going to take 
that kind of commitment from Congress, from the administration, 
to bring broadband to rural areas. And it is going to take 
partnerships with many different industries to do that. And I 
would encourage that kind of broad thinking as you have done 
today in achieving rural broadband deployment. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHNEIDER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. SCHNEIDER"> Great. Thank you. I'm going to steal a few
extra seconds if that's okay just to reflect on your comments, 
because I think as we are here talking about what broadband can 
do and the comments you made, three things jump out at me. If 
we get this right again, we can grow our economy. At a time of 
great division in our country, broadband can unite us. And it 
is necessary, Mr. Osborn, what you said. If we are going to as 
a Nation lead the world, lead the world economically in a 
global economy, lead the world with information, lead the world 
with our values, this is a step towards that. So I just want to 
thank the witnesses again and thank the chairman for having 
this hearing. Thanks very much.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Thank you, Mr. Schneider. I noticed today
you mentioned you used to carry around punch cards and worked 
for Sears Catalogue. So I must say I think you are younger 
looking than obviously you are. But thanks for sharing that 
with us. It makes me feel better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Chairman BLUM">    I would now like to recognize Mr. Luetkemeyer for 5 minutes 
from Missouri.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> I am fine.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BLUM</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Chairman BLUM">Fine? Are there any further questions anyone
has?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Chairman BLUM">If not, then I would like to thank each of our panelists 
for taking the time today to testify. It is truly fascinating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Chairman BLUM">As this hearing comes to a close, I hope that we have 
opened some eyes--certainly have opened mine--and educated a 
few folks about how important advanced telecommunication 
services are to our Nation's rural small businesses and how 
important it is to create a positive regulatory environment for 
the businesses represented on our panel. I am heartened to hear 
that the FCC has begun to make things a little more user-
friendly for folks like our witnesses today, but more must be 
done. These small businesses are ready, willing, able, and 
frankly, itching, to get out there and build these networks, if 
only Washington, D.C., would get out of their way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Chairman BLUM">I ask unanimous consent that members have 5 legislative

    Chairman Blum, Ranking Member Schneider, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on 
the important topic of improving broadband deployment in rural 
America.
    Introduction
    I am the Chief Executive Officer of the VTX1 Companies, a 
rural telecommunications provider based in Raymondville, Texas, 
which is about 35 miles north of the US border with Mexico on 
US-69E. I have served in this position for over 12 years, and 
prior to that worked for several large telecommunications 
equipment manufacturers. My beginning in the industry dates 
back to July, 1970, when I started with Southwestern Bell in 
downtown Dallas, Texas. I progressed with them in jobs of 
increasing responsibility in Dallas, St. Louis, Ft. Worth, 
Kansas City, Houston, and finally Morristown, NJ, at AT&amp;amp;T's 
company headquarters. Thirty plus years later, after leaving 
AT&amp;amp;T in the mid-1980s, I now reside in the Texas Rio Grande 
Valley in my current position. Today, I am representing WTA - 
Advocates for Rural Broadband, a national trade association, on 
whose board of directors I serve.
    VTX1 got its start as Valley Telephone Cooperative, Inc., 
or ``VTCI'', in April 1952, when a group of local farmers and 
ranchers formed a non-profit telephone cooperative under the 
Texas Telephone Cooperative Act of 1946. They did so because 
Southwestern Bell and General Telephone of the Southwest, GTE, 
had refused to bring telephone service out to the rural south 
Texas communities due to the enormous expense of doing so. With 
the help of several loans from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, our cooperative finally began providing service in 
1957 after laying cables and establishing equipment switching 
centers. We began with four brand new ``exchanges'', or 
geographic service areas, and grew by continued construction 
and by purchasing exchanges from General Telephone. By 1979, we 
had 17 exchanges within 19 counties in deep South Texas that 
comprised a total of 7,300 square miles. Our current density is 
only .7 access lines per square mile which is one of our 
state's lowest density ratios.
    In the late 1980's, VTCI saw an opportunity with 
transporting long distance up from Mexico and back and 
partnered with AT&amp;amp;T in this endeavor. An unregulated, for-
profit, subsidiary VTX Communications, LLC, was formed in 
December, 1987, to provide carrier transport services for 
almost a dozen Mexican carriers through fiber-optic bridge 
crossings at Laredo and Hidalgo, Texas. Long distance service 
was added around 1991, fixed-wireless broadband service in 
2004, then finally television entertainment service in 2005. 
VTX Telecom, LLC, a for-profit subsidiary, was formed in 
December 2000, after the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was 
signed into law to provide telephone, and now internet and 
television service to underserved communities outside of the 
VTCI communities. VTX Telecom receives a nominal amount of 
Federal support (i.e., federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF) 
support) and some Texas USF funds (TUSF); VTX Communications is 
not eligible to receive either FUSF or TUSF because, as stated 
above, it is an unregulated entity. The primary recipient of 
FUSF support is the original cooperative entity, Valley 
Telephone Cooperative. Utilizing a very complex accounting 
system of cross charges for work-time and other expenses, we 
are able to run our company efficiently as a single entity, and 
to avoid confusing customers with all the different company 
names, we took the name VTX1 Companies in 2012.
    Through expansion, diversification, and acquisitions, VTX1 
now provides broadband internet access, television, security, 
and voice telephone service to approximately 16,000 residents, 
businesses, schools, libraries, government buildings, and other 
anchor institutions in a 10,000 square mile service area--the 
boundary is loosely defined by Laredo, San Antonio, Corpus 
Christi, and Brownsville, Texas. We have just under 200 
employees, around 120 buildings and around 150 service trucks 
and vehicles. Our impact on the South Texas economy is 
significant.
    Solutions for Rural America
    I intend to focus on three main areas where I think 
Congress can work with regulators to encourage broadband 
deployment in rural America.
    1. Universal Service Policy
    Serving rural America is incredibly costly, and we couldn't 
do it in the rural areas we serve without the federal Universal 
Service Fund (USF). The principle of universal service, that 
every American, regardless of where he or she lives, should 
have access to communications technology, has its roots in the 
Communications Act of 1934. The USF, as we know it today, was 
created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Without the 
support we and other rural telecommunications providers receive 
from the fund, our cooperative members would never be able to 
afford the services we provide. According to the Telecom Act, 
USF support is supposed to be ``predictable and sufficient'' to 
the task of providing ``advanced telecommunications and 
information services...in all regions of the Nation.'' 
Unfortunately, the principle of sufficiency seems to become 
less and less important to federal policymakers over time.
    For the past several years, the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) has labored to modernize USF, most recently 
after the release of the National Broadband Plan in 2010, which 
recommended freezing support for small, rural broadband 
providers at 2010 funding levels. The reform efforts culminated 
in an Order in March of 2016, which has resulted in companies 
similarly situated to VTX1 seeing their support reduced because 
of a budget target reflecting 2011 funding levels. 
Incidentally, the 2011 support levels were based on support for 
voice networks as opposed to broadband networks, which is what 
the reformed USF would focus on post-2011. This approach 
attacks the problem of getting broadband to rural America from 
the wrong angle. Instead of setting a goal for broadband in 
rural America and attempting to determine what that would cost, 
the FCC has arbitrarily set a budget and essentially said ``see 
what you can do with this.''
    So far, VTX1's USF reimbursement from mid-2016 to June 2017 
is down approximately a half million dollars on an annualized 
basis with grater reductions anticipated in light of the caps 
and constraints the FCC has placed on the overall High Cost 
Fund to stay under its self-imposed budget cap. This despite 
the fact that we have had to increase our fiber to the home 
investments in fiber, electronics and maintenance fees to meet 
the FCC's goals of no less than 10 mbps down with a preferred 
25 mbps down broadband service. In the last two and a half 
years, VTCI has spent almost $27 million in capital expense 
(CAPEX) dollars that had been previously committed to as part 
of our five-year CAPEX plan to bring high-speed broadband 
service to our rural cooperative members. These federal support 
reductions have now reduced our capital expansion within our 
VTCI service areas and slowed the conversion to fiber-optic 
technology. It is important, and necessary, to upgrade all 
terrestrial networks to fiber because, while it does cost money 
to upgrade to a fiber-optic infrastructure, a fiber-optic 
network will have a service life several times longer than that 
of a copper one--plus the maintenance costs of a fiber-optic 
network are much less than a copper infrastructure. 
Additionally, serving the needs of our national cellular 
companies to ``backhaul'' their soon to be deployed 5G LTE 
traffic from their towers to their regional switching centers 
will be very important. Because of the speeds involved, 
cellular carriers will be hard pressed to backhaul their 
traffic by radio technology alone.
    Instead of caps and cuts to support, the High Cost Program 
within USF needs to be fully funded so that carriers can 
upgrade their networks to deploy broadband further throughout 
their service territories. If that cannot be done at the very 
least an inflationary adjustment to the High Cost Program is 
warranted so that high-quality broadband can be pushed further 
out into rural America. If the country wants to get serious 
about catching up with the rest of the world's broadband 
deployment, the High Cost Program support should actually be 
increased.
    2. Streamlining the Permitting Process for Existing Rights 
of Way
    If Congress wants to improve the efficiency by which USF 
dollars are put to use, it should review and reform the 
permitting process for access to federal lands and other rights 
of way. Small companies like mine wait years and spend hundreds 
of thousands of dollars per project on environmental, 
archaeological, and historical preservation reviews. It is not 
uncommon for small companies like mine to experience delays of 
up to 18 to 24 month in getting broadband projects going 
because of these types of review. This is particularly 
problematic in parts of the country that have shorter 
construction seasons than Texas.
    While some of these reviews are necessary and important, 
particularly when it comes to previously undisturbed ground, it 
makes little sense to require extensive reviews for projects 
that make use of existing and operational rights-of-way. I'll 
share an anecdote from my own experience, which is not 
atypical.
    VTX1 received both a Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) 
loan/grant combination from the Department of Commerce and a 
Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) grant from the 
Department of Agriculture to construct a fiber-optic 
infrastructure as part of the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act (ARRA) stimulus program. The intent of these 
projects was to be shovel-ready, and ours was but for the fact 
that we had to wait nine months for our environmental reviews 
needed to bore underground within 20 feet of ``center line'' 
along a U.S. federal highway.
    Obtaining environmental permits to use rights-of-way that 
have been and are continually being disturbed should be fast-
tracked for approval.
    3. Regulatory Reporting Burdens
    We continue to be concerned with the increased quantity of 
reporting obligations and reporting burdens placed upon us 
involving regulatory reporting to the FCC, the Universal 
Service Administrative Company (USAC), and the National 
Exchange Carriers Association (NECA) and other federal agencies 
when the recovery of those costs has been capped by not only 
the FCC's Corporate Operations cap but the maximum $250 per 
line per month cap. VTCI performed a detailed labor study in 
2016 and found that we spend around 3,200 hours completing just 
the federal reporting requirements placed on us. This costs us 
about $100,000 a year in wages and another $50,000 a year in 
benefit costs alone with none of these dollars being recovered 
by any federal support. A copy of our spreadsheet showing the 
regulatory burden wage analysis is attached. Total benefit cost 
was estimated at fifty percent of wage cost. While we recognize 
the need to justify all of our support expenditures and 
requests, we believe the FCC must take all necessary steps to 
ensure that high cost rural companies such as VTCI are allowed 
to recover every dollar of these regulatory burden expenditures 
from the high cost support mechanisms. Without such assurances, 
small rural companies such as ours may very well be squeezed by 
having ever increasing reporting requirements while receiving 
ever smaller support due to caps and constraints on the high 
cost fund.
    Conclusion
    Our conclusions are straightforward:
          &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The High Cost Fund component of Federal USF 
        needs to continue in remote rural serving areas as well 
        as having a cost of living escalator to keep the fund 
        viable during periods of inflation. An increase in High 
        Cost Fund monies should be considered as well to speed 
        up broadband deployment;
          &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Permitting timelines should be greatly 
        reduced in areas and along roads where the land has 
        been previously and continuously disturbed;
          &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Regulatory reporting should be streamlined 
        and limited to items that have a significant, 
        measurable impact on broadband deployment in America.
    This concludes my testimony. Thank you for your attention 
and I look forward to answering any questions you may have.
