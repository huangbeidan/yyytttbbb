    <Statement>
    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK D. LUCAS, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM OKLAHOMA</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">    The Chairman. This hearing of the Subcommittee on </paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">Conservation and Forestry entitled, Small Watershed 
Infrastructure: Continuing the Mission, Building Upon Success, 
will come to order. I recognize myself for an opening 
statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">Good morning, and welcome to today's hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">Nearly 70 years ago, our predecessors exhibited exceptional 
foresight through their investment in watershed infrastructure 
projects. The lasting benefits of those investments through the 
Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program, commonly 
known as P.L. 83-566, have allowed the NRCS to partner with 
local communities to provide technical and financial assistance 
to build structures necessary to protect communities, allowing 
them to thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">Since 1948, nearly 12,000 small flood prevention dams have 
served local communities by providing both economic and 
conservation benefits. It is unsettling to imagine the 
destruction of property that would have taken place if these 
investments had not been made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">While we celebrate the success of these programs, we cannot 
overlook that their strategic infrastructure is aging and 
requires upkeep. By the end of 2017, nearly 5,500 structures 
will have reached the end of their intended life-span. 
Maintaining and updating these structures is often unaffordable 
for the communities that have benefited from the P.L. 83-566 
program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">In 2000, understanding the urgency of this issue, I 
introduced legislation to rehabilitate many of our watershed 
projects through the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Act. At the 
time, my message was simple: If we take no action to 
rehabilitate, we will be left with the cost of removing these 
structures or faced with constant threats to life and property 
as these dams continue to age. And we would definitely watch 
our $8.5 billion investment in the successful partnership wash 
away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">Those concerns are as important today as they were 17 years 
ago. I am confident that a modest investment now will pay off 
greatly over the next 70 years, across rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">Both watershed construction and rehabilitation are 
necessary and important to maintaining and expanding our rural 
infrastructure, which is why I made those programs a priority, 
helping secure several hard-fought gains over the past several 
years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">For example, in the 2014 Farm Bill, we created partnership 
opportunities to target and leverage Federal conservation funds 
through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program. 
Additionally, Congress agreed to $250 million in mandatory 
funding for small watershed rehabilitation to address the 
program backlog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. FRANK D. LUCAS">And, finally, I am pleased that the 2017 appropriations 
language included funding for P.L. 83-566 also. While those 
represent important steps in working towards the current 
backlog of P.L. 83-566 programs, more work must be done. This 
rural infrastructure may be largely out of sight, but it is of 
critical importance to those communities affected.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Fudge</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Fudge">Thank you very much, Chairman Lucas, and thank
you for holding this hearing today. I know that watershed 
programs are near and dear to your heart, and I am pleased to 
hear more about them today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Fudge">The Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program and 
the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program are important tools 
in our conservation toolkit. These programs play an important 
role in preserving the viability of our farming communities and 
landscapes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Fudge">One of the biggest benefits of the watershed programs is 
the flexibility and engagement provided at the local level 
through project sponsors. These projects are largely dictated 
by local interests to help address resource concerns and the 
health and productivity of individual watersheds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Fudge">With over 1,300 active or completed watershed projects, 
this program has left a mark around the nation. As I learn more 
about this program, I am amazed at the scope of the projects 
that can be undertaken within this authority, from water 
quality, to soil erosion control, to fish and wildlife 
enhancement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Fudge">This program seems even more important as we acknowledge 
the effects of climate change. Programs that help address flood 
mitigation and drought for our farmers only become more 
important with each passing day. These programs make our 
watersheds more resilient in the face of escalating extreme 
weather events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Fudge">As you may know, Lake Erie, where I live, faces challenges 
from toxic algae blooms that wreak havoc on ecosystems and 
taint drinking water for many Ohioans. As we discuss watershed 
programs today, I hope to learn more about the advances to 
improve water quality that may be beneficial to Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Fudge">As we begin moving toward the next farm bill, I am looking 
forward to hearing more about watershed programs and the 
Regional Conservation Partnership Program which can utilize 
P.L. 83-566 authority.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. COLLIN C. PETERSON">I know these watershed programs, especially the Small 
Watershed Rehabilitation Program, are important to you, as we 
have discussed this over the years, and you have been a 
longtime advocate and been part of including it in the farm

    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. COLLIN C. PETERSON">Watershed programs are incredibly important, as the 
Chairman said, and part of our conservation toolbox. But, 
unfortunately, a lot of folks are not really aware of the 
programs themselves or the benefits that they provide, which is 
why today's hearing is so useful. For example, a decade ago, 
the Small Watershed Program relied on earmarks for funding, 
which despite its broad support in Congress is what led to the 
program's demise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. COLLIN C. PETERSON">As part of the 2014 Farm Bill, we allowed project sponsors 
to use P.L. 83-566 authorities under the Regional Conservation

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">All right. Very good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Thank you, Chairman Lucas, Ranking Member Fudge, and 
Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you all, actually, for the 
opportunity to be here today to talk about the Natural 
Resources Conservation Service and our watershed programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">We appreciate the ongoing support this Subcommittee has 
demonstrated for voluntary private lands conservation that help 
us improve the nation's soil, water, and related natural 
resources. But before I talk specifically about the watershed 
programs, I would like to make a couple of comments about NRCS' 
organizational structure and our mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">We have 2,800 field offices fanned out across the country, 
and that is important because these field offices provide 
technical and financial assistance to local landowners. And as 
you may know or may not know, more than 70 percent of land 
ownership in this country is held by private landowners. Those 
individuals make decisions every day that not only impact their 
operation, but also impacts their neighbors, impacts their 
watersheds, and impacts, in fact, the entire U.S. population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Our Conservation Technical Assistance Program basically is 
the backbone of offering that technical assistance to these 
private landowners. Through CTA, in combination with our 
delivery system, we invoke a conservation planning process that 
basically helps us analyze local landowners' needs, interests, 
desires, on their property, at their location, and in 
combination with them develop a conservation plan of operations 
to help them meet their objectives as well as to help improve 
their natural resources and productivity for today and for 
future generations, while at the same time complying with all 
Federal, state, and local laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">The sound science that we bring to these private landowners 
on a daily basis not only helps improve the nation's natural 
resources, it also informs policy development to make sure that 
taxpayer investments and conservation achieve the greatest 
return on investment as is possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">So with that backdrop, the focus here today on the 
Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act is actually a 
very enlightening conversation. The Watershed Protection and 
Flood Prevention Act not only helps us deliver that technical 
and financial assistance to private landowners where they live, 
on individual property, but it also gives us the authority to 
work with communities and through eligible sponsors. And in 
those communities, we can work with them and do conservation 
planning for critical infrastructure activities that help also 
address broader natural resource issues that may be realized 
other than by what is happening on an individual farm or a 
ranch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">The value of such an integrated approach has been 
demonstrated over the past 80 years, and particularly over the 
past 63 years with the Watershed Protection and Flood 
Prevention Act. Since 1947, even with its predecessor, the 
Flood Control Act of 1944, we have invested in over 2,000 local 
projects with local sponsors and we have constructed almost 
12,000 watershed dams to date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And through this process, we are realizing on an annual 
basis almost $2.3 billion a year in average annual benefits. 
Some examples of those benefits include protecting 610,000 
homes, 61,000 bridges, 46,000 businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">If you think about farms, an average farm being 200 acres, 
the 180,000 farms that are being protected would equate to 
roughly 36 million acres. That is about the size of the State 
of Georgia, the largest state east of the Mississippi. And it 
is not just the size of the State of Georgia, it is some of the 
most productive cropland we all benefit from that is the size 
of the State of Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">But despite these successes, we are talking about manmade 
infrastructure here. Manmade infrastructure does require 
continued attention. And to date, NRCS has identified about 
2,000 structures that are high-hazard structures needing 
attention for public safety concerns. We estimate that it would 
take approximately $7 billion to address some of those public 
safety concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And we also think investing in those upgrades today may 
help us benefit by reducing the overall investment should we 
continue to delay. Future investments for continued degradation 
of these type of structures may require more investments in the 
future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Congress has also recognized this by continuing to fund 
this program; recently, in this fiscal year, $150 million for a 
variety of projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, as you can see, the Public Law 83-566 program is 
a very beneficial program across this country. We have done a 
lot of work with landowners at larger scales of the Mississippi 
River Basin, the Chesapeake Bay. We have demonstrated 
tremendous success at that scale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">But this 250,000 acre watershed scale gives us the ability 
to really put a lot more focus and energy and attention in an 
appropriate scale to realize the benefits to our natural 
resources and to our local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">We are always working for ways to try to improve our 
business practices, to help get more conservation on the 
ground. Protecting our nation's small watersheds is no small 
task, and when it comes to protecting lives through proper 
maintenance and upkeep, it is something USDA does not take 
lightly.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">Washington, D.C.
Introduction</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">Chairman Lucas, Ranking Member Fudge, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today 
to discuss the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) watershed 
programs. I appreciate the ongoing support and leadership this 
Subcommittee has provided for voluntary, private lands conservation and 
the improvement of our soil, water, and other invaluable natural 
resources. Before I dig too deep into the NRCS watershed programs and 
activities, I want to briefly provide some introductory comments on our 
structure and mission that help to augment our critical watershed 
activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">NRCS provides technical and financial conservation assistance to 
individual, private landowners. More than 70 percent of land in the 
United States is held by private landowners. Decisions those landowners 
make every day not only have an impact on their land, but that of their 
neighbors, their watersheds, and ultimately the entire U.S. population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">A series of programs (i.e., Environmental Quality Incentives 
Program, Conservation Stewardship Program, and the Agricultural 
Conservation Easement Program) have been created and revised through 
the farm bill process to help NRCS facilitate its unique delivery 
system, carried out through local field offices that provide assistance 
to individual landowners across the nation. Through these programs, 
NRCS has made tremendous strides in helping farmers, ranchers, 
foresters, and other private landowners restore and enhance our 
nation's natural resource base in a voluntary, incentive-based fashion. 
Perhaps most importantly, the decisions surrounding the implementation 
and prioritization of these programs and funding are made on the local 
level, through Local Working Groups and State Technical Committees to 
ensure local needs are addressed.
Proven Success</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">Our latest science-based modeling under the Natural Resources 
Inventory (NRI) and assessment through the Conservation Effects 
Assessment Program (CEAP) continues to show voluntary, incentive-based 
conservation is effective. In the Chesapeake Bay, voluntary adoption of 
conservation practices has led to reductions in erosion and 
sedimentation by over 60 percent, and reductions in nutrient losses, 
specifically of nitrogen, approached 40 percent. Through a landscape 
focus to our conservation investments, some 80 percent of the Bay's 
critical cropland acreage has had conservation measures implemented. 
NRCS conservation investments in the Bay have resulted in a reduction 
of 15.1 million tons of sediment per year, enough to fill 150,000 train 
cars--which would stretch from Washington, D.C. to Albuquerque, New 
Mexico. Improvements in water quality monitoring data and aquatic 
habitat identified by external parties also confirms the positive 
impact of these investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">This science-to-solutions approach has been demonstrated to 
positively affect critical wildlife species as well. Through another 
targeted landscape initiative, our Working Lands for Wildlife 
Initiative, NRCS has helped private landowners install appropriate 
science-based conservation practices on over 6.7 million acres. 
Wildlife species targeted for listing on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service's Threatened and Endangered Species List have recovered to the 
point where a pending listing decision is no longer being considered. 
As a result, thousands of landowners will not face increased regulatory 
pressures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">The sound science that NRCS brings to the table not only improves 
our nation's natural resources, it also directs policy development to 
ensure that taxpayers receive the greatest return on their conservation 
investments. The aforementioned accomplishments have been realized 
through our Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) Program, the 
backbone of our Agency's conservation delivery machine. Many customers 
begin their relationship with NRCS through requests for technical 
assistance that later evolve into conservation plans that may include 
financial assistance through one of the farm bill programs. Our CTA 
Program, in combination with our organizational delivery system, 
affords us the opportunity to visit with landowners on their property, 
to analyze their land, learn their objectives, and then collaboratively 
formulate a plan to help them meet their objectives, comply with 
Federal, state, and local laws and ordinances, sustaining their 
operation for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">Landscape-scale approaches are foundational to progress toward 
meeting today's challenges. In addition to the Chesapeake Bay, and 
Working Lands for Wildlife initiatives, NRCS is also collaborating with 
others in critical landscapes to address water quality concerns in the 
western portion of Lake Erie, water quantity efficiencies in 
California's Central Valley and the Colorado River Basin; fisheries 
improvements in the Pacific Northwest; acid mine drainage remediation 
needs in Appalachia and the Intermountain West; and flood protection 
for communities in the Central Plains and the Northeast.
Importance of Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">In addition to demonstrated success in larger landscapes, NRCS's 
Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program, authorized by the 
Flood Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954, as amended (Public 
Law 83-566, also known as P.L. 83-566) encourages focused conservation 
investments in smaller landscapes (i.e., watersheds) of 250,000 acres 
or less. P.L. 83-566 gained support from successes of a preceding 
program, the Flood Control Act of 1944 (Public Law 78-534). The Flood 
Control Act placed a primary focus on watershed protection by 
preventing floodwater damage and stabilizing stream channels, 
tributaries, and banks to reduce erosion and sediment transport. P.L. 
83-566 extended the authorities of the Flood Control Act of 1944 to 
capitalize on NRCS's flexibility for delivering additional conservation 
investments beyond those focused solely on flood damages. Through P.L. 
83-566, NRCS can offer conservation practices to individual landowners 
and work with local communities to create vital infrastructure 
protecting and restoring natural resources. The value of such an 
integrated approach has resulted in significant positive contributions 
to local economies and natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">Since 1947, NRCS, through our watershed programs, has worked with 
our watershed partners to:
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Invest in over 2,000 projects within local communities for a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">cumulative total investment of $6.2 billion.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Construct 12,000 watershed project dams.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Realize $2.2 billion in average annual benefits. Such</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">benefits come from:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">&amp;lt;ctr-circle&amp;gt; 610,000--homes protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">&amp;lt;ctr-circle&amp;gt; 46,000--businesses protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">&amp;lt;ctr-circle&amp;gt; 180,000--farms protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">&amp;lt;ctr-circle&amp;gt; 61,000--bridges protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">&amp;lt;ctr-circle&amp;gt; 28,000--domestic water supplies protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">&amp;lt;ctr-circle&amp;gt; 48,000,000--people benefited.
(Source: NRCS Program Operations Information Tracking System database).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">Notwithstanding such success, both past and current, man-made 
infrastructure requires continued attention. NRCS has identified a 
current need of almost $7 billion to address public safety concerns for 
some 2,000 structures that have been identified as high hazard. A 
majority of NRCS watershed dams are over 50 years of age. Investing in 
needed upgrades today may help mitigate against more expensive future 
investments as these facilities continue to degrade. This investment 
could also result in removal of public safety concerns and help to 
avoid losing a portion of the aforementioned benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">The cyclical nature of P.L. 83-566 related funding for NRCS 
watershed programs introduces a set of unique challenges for program 
management of projects requiring a multi-year commitment on behalf of 
eligible project sponsors, permitting agencies, and the private-sector 
assisting with such work. For example, planning, design, and permitting 
requires significant up-front non-Federal investments to conduct 
environmental assessments, secure necessary land-rights, complete 
requisite engineering designs, and obtain required permits. Non-Federal 
partners have to make critical risk management decisions related to 
financial commitments in the face of budget uncertainty for project 
completion. For the past 4 fiscal years, funding for this program has 
been:
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; FY 2014 = $260 million,
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; FY 2015 = $70 million,
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; FY 2016 = $12 million, [and]
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; FY 2017 = $150 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">Because public safety cannot be ignored, NRCS has worked with a 
number of organizations to develop tools and business practices 
intended to mitigate against risks from limited investments in capital 
improvements. One example of these efforts includes collaboration with 
state dam safety officials to develop Emergency Action Plans (EAPs) for 
high hazard structures. The plans identify potential downstream hazards 
and which emergency personnel are to be notified in advance of 
undesirable conditions at any given location. These plans are 
supplemented by annual emergency exercise drills for added 
preparedness. Finally, NRCS has recently released DamWatch, which 
quickly alerts essential personnel electronically through email, text 
message, or pager when dams are experiencing a high rainfall or 
earthquake event. These efforts allow for the agency's limited 
resources to be directed to the right place at the right time.
Utilizing Watershed Funding</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">While these efforts to remain vigilant for public safety have 
proven successful to date, Congress has also recognized the need for 
continued conservation, and capital improvement, investments as well. 
Through the FY 2015 appropriations process, Congress directed NRCS to 
establish a long-term, multi-year plan to guide needed investments in 
watershed surveys and planning, and watershed operations as authorized 
under P.L. 83-566. While completing the plan, NRCS determined a 
prioritized need to invest in 220 projects. These projects would 
address a variety of issues, ranging from flood prevention and 
watershed protection, to agricultural water management, to municipal 
and industrial water supply. The total cost of these 220 projects is 
estimated to be $1.4 billion from FY 2017 through FY 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">During the current fiscal year, Congress provided $150 million for 
necessary expenses in accordance with P.L. 83-566 and related laws 
relating to activities of the Department. This $150 million is to 
remain available until expended, provided that $50 million be allocated 
to projects and activities that can commence promptly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">NRCS is preparing to first address a project backlog, remediation 
of existing structures, and then focus on new projects. Our agency has 
done a good job of preparing for and prioritizing project work in the 
face of cyclical funding realities. We use a risk index to identify a 
combination of physical, economic, and social factors ensuring that 
taxpayer investments address the highest risks first. Currently, the 
following are in progress: 70 watershed plans, 80 engineering design 
efforts, and 30 ongoing construction projects.
Conclusion</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Bramblett ">    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Subcommittee, P.L. 
83-566 enables NRCS to bring all of the agency's technical, scientific, 
and financial resources to bear at the appropriate geographic scale--
the small watersheds of 250,000 acres or less--where we can have the 
greatest impact on our nation's resources. This program reflects our 
commitment to local leadership on critical conservation issues and has 
a reach that touches every Committee Member's District. NRCS 
continually seeks to take responsible steps toward streamlining and 
modernizing our operations, while maximizing opportunities to get more 
conservation on the ground. Protection of our nation's small watersheds 
is no small task and when it comes to protecting lives through proper 
maintenance and upkeep, it is something USDA does not take lightly. I 
would like to thank all of you for continuing to invest in the safety 
and functionality of our small watersheds, voluntary conservation, and 
of course for the opportunity to appear before you this morning. I 
would be happy to respond to any questions.

be recognized for questioning in the order of seniority for 
Members who were at the start of the hearing, and after that 
Members will be recognized in order of arrival. I appreciate 
Members' understanding, and I recognize myself for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Deputy Director">Let's visit for a moment, Deputy Director, just in the 
broad general sense about what we are talking about when we 
discuss P.L. 83-566 projects. Many people, when they think of 
dams, think of huge things from Hoover Dam on down, these giant 
monstrosities designed and built and maintained by the Army 
Corps of Engineers, a classic example in the general public's 
mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Deputy Director">But, P.L. 83-566 dams work under a different concept, 
correct? Instead of giant structures, you have networks of 
smaller earthen dams working in an interlocking fashion to 
provide in many instances tremendous amounts of flood 
protection, but not one big structure. Fair statement?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Deputy Director">    But that also means that from the agency's perspective and 
the community's perspective, there are a lot more of these 
facilities to maintain, correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">That is correct. In general, you are exactly
correct on all fronts. These structures basically, when 
originally planned, were put in the upper reaches of the 
smaller watersheds to help catch some of that early rainfall. 
And you are right, they are also positioned and laid out in 
such a fashion to maximize flood prevention from an early 
perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    The early rainfall, 100 year storms, basically individuals 
downstream are not going to see any change in the channel, 
because in addition to being a floodwater-retarding structure 
and being strategically placed, they are designed for 10 day 
drawdown. Most of them are designed for a 10 day drawdown, 
which is where the real beauty and the benefit from these 
structures come, because that is allowing not only the 
mitigation of flood downstream, it is also allowing it to 
dissipate at a rate that doesn't cause any damages.

    <speaker>The Chairman. Whatever that may be</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="The Chairman. Whatever that may be"/>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="The Chairman. Whatever that may be">And let's talk for a moment about the nature of the 
structures themselves, the original technology dating back to 
the 1940s. Science has improved that, the metals in the valve 
works, the design works, the letdowns, the way we build 
spillways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="The Chairman. Whatever that may be">    I have had folks tell me in the field that these 50 year 
designs that we originally went with, with the new technologies 
and the new materials, while not rated for it, we might 
potentially get a century's worth of good out of the 
rehabilitation process. Is that a fair assessment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">That is a fair assessment. In fact, many of
the early structures that were built were built with a 50 year 
design life. And even into the 1970s, some of that technology 
was coming on board, and many of the later structures were 
built with a 100 year design life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Today, anytime we do a rehabilitation activity, we really 
work toward trying to get that 100 year design life. And so not 
only the new technology for the materials that we use, but the 
way we do planning, the efficiencies that we can gain with some 
business practices associated with that, help make for a much 
more efficient delivery of conservation to individuals and to 
landowners.

very few infrastructure projects the Federal Government is 
involved in or partnering with other entities that have 
potentially a century's life expectancy. Think of bridges. 
Think of roads. Think of everything else. This is an exception 
in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Let's talk for a moment about the nature of the 
Rehabilitation Program and how this is not just a Federal 
effort, but the local entities are required to put up resources 
to do things as a part of that rehabilitation cost coverage.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">That is exactly right. That is one of the
beauties of basically all of the voluntary programs that NRCS 
brings to bear. It is not just Federal taxpayer, the taxpayers 
that are carrying the brunt of the investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">NRCS, as I mentioned, works through a voluntary approach. 
We operate off of a request for assistance. And many times when 
we provide information to local sponsors as they articulate to 
us their issues and their concerns, when we talk about the 
flexibilities and the authorities of Public Law 83-566 and its 
related legislation, they are willing, sometimes in the face of 
budget uncertainties, to make some financial commitments on 
their own to try to progress in addressing those resource 
issues and concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    In the end, though, the way the authorities are set up, 
generally NRCS provides 65 percent cost-share associated with a 
lot of these activities and private eligible sponsors provide 
the other 35 percent.

could be completed, because we are only talking about a small 
percentage of the potential sites in North America that could 
be addressed in these projects, just off the top of your head, 
if the resources were available, how many more structures are 
there at some stage in the process, initial planning, initial 
consideration on the new construction side, off the top of your 
head, Director?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Bramblett"> Right. We have roughly 30 projects in
construction today and roughly 80 projects in the design phase 
and another 70 with watershed plans ready to move into the 
design phase; and then many more in the assessment phase, 
looking at these structures, looking at the downstream hazards 
and trying to identify those to get those prepared for 
planning. And so it is a sequence of preplanning, planning, 
design, and construction.

district that does not have any structures in place, whether in

    <speaker>Ms. Fudge</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. Fudge">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Ms. Fudge">Thank you for being here as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. Fudge">    Mr. Bramblett, in your written testimony, you comment on 
how flexible P.L. 83-566 can be, particularly in delivering 
additional conservation investments beyond those focused solely 
on flood damage. Could you talk a bit about the scope and types 
of projects other than those that directly address flood 
damage?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Sure. Originally, in the 1954 legislation, a
lot of the work we did, land treatment, when I say land 
treatment, I am talking about that one-on-one conservation 
technical assistance we offer to private landowners to help 
them plan and install conservation practices that will reduce 
soil erosion, improve water quality, increase wildlife habitat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Some of the early work we did was primarily to make sure 
that we reduced erosion that possibly could get into these 
watershed structures and reduce sedimentation, siltation, and 
try to extend the life of these structures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    As time moved on, the flexibility of this program grew in 
popularity. And so from a water quality perspective, we had 
more requests come to us, in addition to just the structural 
measures, we had many community requests come to us asking for 
us to address some of those soil erosion, water quality, 
wildlife habitat-type resources alone. And we have been able in 
later years to address those as resources have been available 
to us.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Fudge</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. Fudge">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. Fudge">    Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana are currently leading a 
national RCPP Program designed to reduce the chances of harmful 
algae blooms developing in Lake Erie's western basin. How has 
or might P.L. 83-566 be used within such a project?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">P.L. 83-566 can do basically everything that
the programs our agency has to offer. That is why I talk about 
the beauty of the integrated approach from P.L. 83-566.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Many of you are aware of our Environmental Quality 
Incentives Program, our easement programs, as well as our RCPP 
Conservation Stewardship Program. Through those programs, we 
typically work one on one with landowners to address their 
needs. Through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program, 
we are looking at a geographic area. Generally, it is a larger 
geographic area than the 250,000 acres outlined in Public Law 
83-566.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">As we work with those landowners, we have seen demonstrated 
success even at those larger scales. In those larger scales, 
basically what we are finding is we can remove a variety of 
streams from EPA's 303(d) listing of impaired streams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Some of the wildlife-focused activities we have done out 
West, we have brought species back from being on the brink of 
being listed on the threatened and endangered species list. And 
what that has allowed is those landowners to avert potential 
regulations associated with the Endangered Species Act that 
they might otherwise face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">P.L. 83-566 gives us the ability to work with those private 
landowners but at the same time work with those leaders in 
local communities who also are seeing issues. Sometimes when we 
are working with private landowners we can make a lot of 
progress. But when community leaders get together and see 
issues beyond individual farms in a collective fashion, then 
through eligible sponsors we can connect with them, and then 
they can help lead and guide some of that local prioritization 
for conservation planning and conservation investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And so with this delivery network that I have talked about, 
to me, that is one of the beauties of our delivery system, is 
that we have local people in local communities who understand 
the local soils, who understand the local climate, who 
understand the local agriculture, the agricultural economy, the 
limitations on individuals, and the limitations on communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    From that integrated approach of both the community and the 
individual landowner, P.L. 83-566 is a fantastic program to 
bring to bear.

    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back">    The chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Bost, 
for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Bost">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Bost">    Mr. Bramblett, in Illinois we don't have a lot of the small 
watersheds, but we do face a lot of challenges with the 
watersheds as they relate to the Mississippi, Ohio, and 
Kaskaskia River in deep southern Illinois, which are huge 
watersheds. That being said, P.L. 83-566, that is implemented 
by the NRCS, how does this program function differently than 
larger management systems that we do on these larger rivers?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Well, the authorities of P.L. 83-566 limit
us basically to 250,000 acres. The measures that the Corps of 
Engineers might use on large watersheds, as the Chairman 
identified, some of those larger structures that come to bear 
in these larger watersheds, we can apply many of the same 
structural measures in smaller watersheds of 250,000 acres or 
less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    If you are thinking in terms of a levee or a dike or 
something like that, we have installed those type of facilities 
in smaller communities to help them be protected from flooding 
on a smaller scale, exactly what you are describing on a larger 
scale in the Mississippi River.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Bost"> Okay. Also, on these watersheds a lot of things
that we face, it is sediment buildup, okay, particularly with 
the Kaskaskia River, because of the agricultural area around 
and as a large a watershed as it is. But what I am trying to 
figure out is, if P.L. 83-566 is put in place up on the 
watershed further up, and maybe it is disqualified because it 
is all one plain, but would that stop that sediment as well?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">No. That is actually a very good
illustration, and that goes back to the Chairman's observation, 
about where we placed small watershed dams and watersheds. 
Generally, we did those upstream in those watersheds to help 
mitigate flooding originally. But with the land treatment 
protections upstream of those structures even more, we also 
prevented additional erosion and sedimentation from moving 
downstream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Even in a larger, broader watershed of beyond 250,000 
acres, we can use P.L. 83-566 in such a means where we can 
break up that watershed to smaller 250,000 acre increments 
where these eligible sponsors have an interest, desire, and a 
willingness to sponsor such projects and help alleviate the 
larger, bigger issues that you might see on the Mississippi in 
the situation like what you are describing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Bost">Well, I appreciate that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Bost">    With that, I yield back.

point. By building these interlocking systems, they benefit 
everyone from the raindrop that hits the ground to the Atlantic 
or the Pacific.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Bost">With that, the chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota, Mr. Peterson, for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Bost">Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Bost">    Mr. Bramblett, did you read Mr. Finney's testimony?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">No, sir, I sure did not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. Okay. Well, are you going to be 
here to listen to it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Yes, sir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. Okay. We have been struggling 
with controlling the water in the Red River because it flows 
north and it is flat and there are a lot of problems. And we 
appreciate the help that we have gotten from NRCS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And right now they are trying to spend $2.5 billion in 
Fargo to run the water around Fargo-Moorhead because we haven't 
been able to control it before it gets there. And we have had 
problems with the Corps trying to recognize what we are doing 
and so forth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">But one of the things that is in Mr. Finney's testimony is 
one of the problems we are having out there is the way they 
have implemented these cost-benefit deals. They do it by 
individual watersheds. And what we are doing is we are trying 
to manage the whole basin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And the way this gets implemented, I guess, they don't take 
into account the overall impact, the situation, and so it makes 
it difficult to make these projects qualify. We tried to get 
some changes when this RCPP thing was set up, but they weren't 
completely implemented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And so whatever you could do to help us work through this, 
because the amount of money that has been wasted over the years 
in the Red River Valley with the erosion that has happened and 
everything else, all the money that we have spent on these 
floods, we could have controlled all of this with that money 
easily and been a much better situation for the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">We are caught up in it, because the P.L. 83-566 authorities 
are limited to some certain amount of size and then they want 
to limit the benefits to that size or something, but that 
doesn't necessarily always make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Whatever you could do to help us try to get through that 
and try to have a more effective response it will save the 
taxpayers money.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Yes, absolutely. While I am not familiar
with that situation, we are more than happy to look at it and 
provide information back to this Committee and others about 
what limitations we have within the existing authorities we 
have and then what kind of potential remediations there might 
be associated with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. See, and I don't know if there 
are some limitations on your authority that preclude you from 
doing what needs to be done. If there is, maybe there is a way 
we could legislatively do something to give you those 
authorities, because it just seems like a wasted opportunity 
and a waste of resources to not address it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Right. Again, not being familiar with the
specific case, it could be a situation with how the watersheds 
were set up also. There could be some reconfiguration of the 
250,000 acres in order to be able to try to achieve the cost-
benefit. Maybe that has already been attempted. But if there 
are other limitations, we are happy to look at that and provide 
feedback to let you know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. Yes, that is one of the issues. 
We did look at trying to make it larger. We had one of the most 
successful projects we have out there, the North Ottawa 
Project, which was a subject of a press opportunity last week. 
That got funded with all state money because it didn't qualify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    And just what it is doing is phenomenal, not only from 
surrounding area being eliminated from flooding, but the 
wildlife that has benefited and everything else that goes on 
with it. If we had 30, 40 of those North Ottawa Projects, they 
wouldn't have to spend $2.5 billion trying to protect Fargo-
Moorhead, whatever you could do.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Okay. We look forward to seeing that
information and providing a response.</paragraph>

problems partnering with any watershed projects that could 
benefit a community?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">At this point, we, as I mentioned earlier,
operate off of a request for assistance. And so being voluntary 
in nature, and having a backlog, that kind of demonstrates that 
we really haven't had a problem trying to partner with 
communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Now, there are times when we are working and making 
information associated with P.L. 83-566 aware to potential 
sponsors. And so because, as we mentioned earlier, this is a 
collaboration of Federal and non-Federal resources, sometimes 
local sponsors work for years with us to try to find the means 
to put up the non-Federal resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    But from the P.L. 83-566 side of the equation, it is a very 
well-received program, and I would have to say we have not had 
any challenges trying to find partners or working with partners 
out there across the landscape.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Abraham</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Abraham"> Would you recommend any policy changes, or are
there any policy changes that need to be implemented to help

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Right. Well, as I mentioned, we are always
looking for improvement on business practices associated with 
how we deliver the program in a streamlined fashion. We talked 
about new technology of materials for construction and the 
like.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. Kuster">I wanted to talk about what is going on in New Hampshire, 
which is a reaction to the changes in our climate, which are 
rather dramatic. It is close to 100&amp;#15; in New Hampshire today, 
which, in my lifetime, is a rare occurrence, and we are in for 
another long, hot summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Ms. Kuster">Last summer we had a drought for our farmers. But a few 
years back, just a couple years ago, I have one community in 
Keene, New Hampshire, that had the 100 year flood 2 out of 3 
years. I am definitely concerned about flooding, and I am 
particularly concerned about the budget cuts that are coming 
down from the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. Kuster">    I appreciate the Chairman bringing this topic to us. I 
support the programs, but I understand you have a tremendous 
backlog. And I want to have a discussion, if we could, about 
how we are going to address the backlog, how we are going to 
help our farmers and ranchers, and create these dams and 
preserve our communities from floods, given the cuts that we 
are facing in your budget and other budgets across the 
Agriculture Department.

    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Thank you so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">In 2015, Congress asked NRCS to develop a multiyear plan 
for addressing some of these aging infrastructures, and we 
basically delivered that report in December 2015. I mentioned 
in my verbal testimony that we have identified some 2,000 
structures that need roughly $7 billion of investment for 
public safety concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">As a big part of that report back to Congress there were 
roughly 220 projects needing more or less $1.4 billion of 
investments. And so we have a prioritization mechanism in 
place. We call it a risk index. And what that does is it looks 
really at what is downstream of these structures as far as 
hazard concerns, what is the shape of that valley like 
downstream, how many people might be impacted, what other kind 
of utilities and what other kind of infrastructure might be 
impacted, and then what is the likelihood that the sponsors are 
going to be able to and willing to participate with us on a 
collaborative effort to try to address those issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Through that process, this is how we have identified and 
lined projects up in such a fashion where we have those that 
are in construction right now, followed by those that are in 
the design phase, followed by those that are in the planning 
phase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    In New Hampshire, we have one project basically for rehab 
that is current, but we also have in that preplanning phase 
that I mentioned earlier 18 watershed structures where we are 
looking at those assessments downstream to try to get them into 
that process so we can address those local concerns as quickly 
as we can.

    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Ms. Kuster">We have had loss of life from floods. We have
had tremendous damage to property. We have had whole towns 
washed away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Ms. Kuster">    If you talk to Vermont that had never had a hurricane until 
Hurricane Irene came through, millions of dollars, whole towns 
were cut off, no roads, no bridges getting to them. I mean, 
this is serious and we need to take care of this. And meanwhile 
the budget that comes forward is cut. I don't understand how we 
are going to protect our constituents.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">From an NRCS perspective, what we are doing
is trying to take advantage of this integrated approach. And, 
again, that is the beauty of P.L. 83-566.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Outside of P.L. 83-566, and we talked about bringing on new 
technology, there is a lot of science just in natural resource 
management that has unfolded since we started this whole 
process of watershed protection and flood prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Some of you may have heard of our Soil Health campaign as 
an example. Soil Health is a mechanism whereby we are working 
with private landowners to increase the organic matter and the 
viability of their soils.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Every one percent increase in organic matter holds an 
additional 27,500 gallons of water. And when you start to 
multiply that out across all of the acreage above some of these 
watershed structures, that is a big deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And not only does it hold more water for drought times and 
from a climate change perspective, but also when you have 
floods there is more aggregate stability, more structure, there 
is more infiltration. That also helps reduce flooding as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Those are just a couple of examples of complementary 
activities that we have with that individual landowner delivery 
system that I keep talking about, along with the integrated 
capacity of the community delivery system under P.L. 83-566.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    When we can work with individuals, we can make a lot of 
progress and we can do a lot of good things. When we can work 
with communities and individuals, we can do a lot more.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kuster</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Ms. Kuster">Well, thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Ms. Kuster">    My time is up. I thank the chair for having the hearing.

way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. Kuster">The gentlelady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. Kuster">    The chair now turns to the gentleman from Mississippi for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Kelly">Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member,
again, for holding this important meeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Kelly">Thank you for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Kelly">Seven, 8 years ago, I didn't understand the value of 
watersheds and backwater levees, and I thought the Corps of 
Engineers just handled all the flooding things. It was in 2013 
when we had the Mississippi River flood in Mississippi. And as 
a serving guardsman, I got to go down there and was shocked to 
find out that the majority of the things that we were depending 
on to save our citizens from a massive flooding and the levees 
and dams breaking, it was not the Corps of Engineers. It was 
these watershed projects and these backwater levees and all 
those things. I came to really value the importance of those 
things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Kelly">That being said, that 2013 flood stressed those levees and 
those backwater levees and watersheds to the point that there 
is damage done. When you stress something to that degree, it is 
imperative that we continue to reinvest in this program 
because, as most people say, an ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure. If we don't put the money on the front-end, we 
will pay for property damage on the back-end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Kelly">    So that being said, Mr. Bramblett, you note in your 
testimony that NRCS strives to not only preserve resources, but 
also to make the taxpayers get the most out of their 
investment. How does the collaborative approach stretch dollars 
farther?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Through this program, as well as a lot of
other programs, but as has been highlighted earlier here, we 
provide Federal resources but only to a certain extent. Non-
Federal resources come into play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">That way, not only do collectively we as Federal taxpayers 
have an investment in these resources, but those who are living 
in the local community and realize those benefits also have 
that investment. And the other thing about that, it is not just 
that investment. They have that ownership, that sense of 
achievement, that success, that appreciation, that social 
capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Everything that goes with being part of a project like this 
is realized as we are successful in constructing, completing, 
averting flood damages, improving soil quality, improving water 
quality, reducing soil erosion, increasing productivity. All of 
those things just make all local communities feel much better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">In addition to that, when we do these projects, not only 
are we trying to make sure that there is that balance of 
Federal and non-Federal resources that come to bear for the 
investment part of it, but we pursue, as Mr. Peterson was 
talking about, a pretty rigorous cost-benefit analysis to make 
sure that whatever Federal taxpayer benefits are being 
invested, there is a greater return on that investment than 
what is actually put forth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    And then, finally, I would just point out that as we are 
talking about some of the risk associated with these aging 
infrastructures, we have mentioned this before, but it bears 
mentioning again, and that is making sure that as we have this 
backlog right now those structures and those situations that 
have the highest risk are the ones that we invest in first as 
well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Kelly">And I also think people don't realize, we are
all pretty parochial in Congress or seem to be, but it matters 
what Illinois does with their watersheds even though I am way 
down in Mississippi, and it matters what Arkansas does and what 
Mississippi does when it applies to New Orleans, because all 
those run to the same headwater which runs into those places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Kelly">    Mr. Bramblett, with the recent appropriation for P.L. 83-
566, how quickly will local communities be able to move forward 
on construction for rehab of new projects?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">As I mentioned, we have 30 dams in
construction right now, 80 in the design phase. With the 
allocation that we recently received, we expect to expend all 
of those funds within 12 months. That just shows you, as the 
process continues to unfold, we continue to work with local 
sponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    I mentioned that they often are making critical risk 
management decisions from a financial perspective, many times 
in the face of uncertain budget circumstances. But it is pretty 
amazing to watch them work with us, enjoy, understand, 
appreciate the process and the partnership between the Federal 
and the non-Federal resources, and continue to work to a point 
where they can be ready to go in helping put conservation 
practices on the ground, works of improvement, other community 
construction activities as soon as resources become available.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Kelly">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Kelly">    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. The gentleman yields back</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"/>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back">The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona for 5 
minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back">Mr. O'Halleran. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back">Mr. Bramblett, first of all, I appreciate the work that the 
agency does. It does an outstanding job given the funds it has. 
I just want to briefly go over a couple things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back">    When you had indicated $7 billion to address public safety, 
that is just for the 2,000 structures that are at very high 
risk. Is that right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">That is correct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Mr. O'Halleran. And then you go onto, they include the 
5,400 structures by the end of 2017 that are at risk also but 
at a lower level. And then we have unmet needs in new 
construction on top of that. The $7 billion is not the real 
number. There is an extended number past that. What is that 
number?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Well, it is a dynamic system, and the
dynamic system in that every year we have more dams come out of 
life, or rather meet their 50 year age requirement. Others are 
meeting their end of design life. And then we have others that 
still maybe need to be addressed because of high public safety 
concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">For example, when we originally built these 12,000 
watershed structures, only 970 of them were built as high 
hazard structures. But being from Arizona, you understand the 
urban sprawl of Phoenix, me being from Georgia, I understand 
the urban sprawl of Atlanta, and so what we had originally 
planned to have only 970 high hazard dams, now we have over 
2,000, almost 2,100 high hazard dams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And any day of the week, in any structure of these 12,000 
structures across the country, someone can put a mobile home 
below that structure and make it a high hazard dam. The exact 
figure is constantly changing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">The best answer I can give you with respect to where we are 
today is the report that we gave in December 2015 regarding the 
2,000 for $7 billion we have 220 projects that are on a higher 
critical need for $1.4 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Mr. O'Halleran. And I believe that partnerships are 
important in this process, but it appears that the current 
Administration and two previous Administrations have all 
decided that the burden should fall mostly on local government 
and local organizations and not the Federal Government, 
although we built many of these structures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And it helps us to improve, as the gentleman from Louisiana 
indicated, clearly the entire downstream process that is going 
on, whether it is Federal lands or private lands that are 
downstream from these structures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">I have 12 Native American Tribes in my district. I have a 
tremendous amount of rural communities. I represent about \1/2\ 
the State of Arizona as far as landmass. And so drought is a 
major concern to everyone across my district and across the 
state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    What changes would you like to see in the next farm bill or 
the budgeting process also to prioritize and enhance drought 
tolerance?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">As I mentioned before, some of the policy
ramifications come from this Committee and others in Congress. 
If you have proposals that you would like us to react to, we 
are more than happy to look at those and give you some feedback 
on how that might mesh with the existing statute, how we 
deliver that particular program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Some of the other activities, I know it is a different 
animal out West when we are talking about soil health and range 
as it is in the East versus highly managed cropland versus 
landscape situations in the West. But the principles of P.L. 
83-566 have been applicable across the board, whether it is 
agricultural water management, rural water supply. Some of 
those authorities that this program has to offer are there to 
come to fruition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">The challenge that we constantly face is the fact that we 
do have a backlog and local communities and sometimes these 
more expensive projects without the Federal investment would 
have a hard time making those improvements in and of 
themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Mr. O'Halleran. You would agree that the Federal investment 
prior to this equation cannot be just passed off to the side, 
that we don't have any skin in the game, we need to have skin 
in the game to protect those Federal lands that are also at 
risk.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">It has been my experience in 20+ years of
doing watershed planning at this scale that there are some 
communities that without that Federal investment would not be 
able to install those works of improvement themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And in many cases, where they have not been able to, there 
are other Federal resources below that, such as Federal 
highways, Federal interstates, and other Federal public lands 
as well that could sustain damages if those works of 
improvements are not realized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Mr. O'Halleran. And then the only other difference that I 
can see, and this is just the scale of size in the West as far 
as the watersheds and even sub-watersheds in relationship to 
the current statute.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">And that is a really good point. I was in
Colorado last week, and the first thing they asked me, are you 
amazed about how wide open it is? And yes, I am always amazed 
every time I go West about how wide open it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Having said that, with the current authorities that we 
have, we do continue to try to construct projects or 
multifaceted projects, if you will, to address scaling issues, 
like those identified by Mr. Peterson or maybe some of the 
things that you are facing in Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Mr. O'Halleran. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. The gentleman yields back</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back"/>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back">    The chair now turns to the gentleman from California for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Mr. Bramblett, welcome today. Again, I have a lot of 
interest in this DamWatch Program that you are speaking to us 
about here today. And I have it is not really related as a 
Federal project, but I have the Oroville Dam, right. I can see 
it from my front window, so to speak. It is monitoring the 
levee infrastructure, all that, extremely important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Obviously, a project like that being a state project or 
Federal ones, I imagine they are using a lot of the technology 
that you are talking about here that can be used more on a 
district basis or a private basis where you have levees and 
dams on that smaller scale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">    Can you walk us through how the collected information is 
used when you receive that to allocate efforts, resources after 
some type of alert has come across, or even if there is not an 
alert situation, just how that would integrate into a regular 
maintenance schedule? How is that information applied? It is 
through an app, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">Right. I need to give you a little bit of
background information to fully answer your question. And we 
talked a lot about public safety, and we have talked about the 
need for capital and investments for upgrades and improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">That said, public safety can't be ignored. And so we 
continue to work with local sponsors, even though these 
structures are their responsibility, to try to help them 
address public safety issues and concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">One of the ways we do that is each year for these high 
hazard structures we go out with them and do an operation and 
maintenance inspection. And as a result of that, if we identify 
issues and concerns, we alert them to those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">In some cases, they have the resources to try to develop 
the designs for remediation, in other cases they depend on us 
to develop designs. In some cases, they have the resources to 
address it, in other cases they don't. We are talking almost 
12,000 structures here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">In addition to having that annual operation and maintenance 
inspection, we also have on these high hazard structures 
developed what we call emergency action plans. And this is part 
of the assessment activity and some of this preplanning effort 
that I talked about a little bit earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">What we do as a part of that process is we look downstream, 
and, God forbid, should there be a dam failure, we identify 
what that flood zone would be. We call it a breach zone. That 
emergency action plan is meant to identify what structures are 
in play, what utilities, what bridges, who the local emergency 
management personnel happen to be, what their phone numbers 
are, what their contacts are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">This DamWatch system basically is a means of collecting all 
that information along with the original designs associated 
with these structures, so that if there ever is a situation 
that we can get to and address in a quick fashion, we know the 
original design information. That helps us more efficiently 
address any kind of catastrophic event that may be unfolding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">So far, we have been fortunate, even though we have had 
even in 2016 these high hazard structures, and this highlights 
the public safety issue, we have had these emergency spillways 
or the portion of this dam that flows water before it overtops, 
54 of those flowed in 2016. It is happening out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">What happens with DamWatch basically is we utilize USGS' 
alert system for stream gauges, for seismic activity. And we 
have all this information that I just described in this 
DamWatch system. What DamWatch then helps us do is it helps us 
send out electronic automated alerts to those critical 
personnel that are identified in this emergency action plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Bramblett">    Depending on the simulated rainfall, we will take that as 
the example, depending on the simulated rainfall, there is a 
certain stage of triggering that goes to these individuals to 
begin monitoring the situation. That is not just local 
emergency management officials. That is state emergency 
management officials as well as Federal emergency management 
officials.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> That is all in real-time then as you----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Bramblett"> That is all real-time information. And it is
for all of our watershed structures, 11,000 of our watershed 
structures, 11,000 of our 12,000 watershed structures right 
now.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> With the preplanning you talked about here,
what if you had a very severe situation or lesser ones, use the 
preplan, and then as the data comes in what is actually 
happening there, you keep track of what water levels are 
looking like. Is this going to reach some kind of an alert 
stage where you have to start planning for something maybe a 
little worse?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Bramblett"> Right. We are taking the next rainfall from
Doppler Radar. We know based off of the soil information our 
agency has and land use what the runoff is going to be like. We 
can simulate what the water levels are going to be in these 
structures.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Let me ask, does it look different for an
emergency event than it does for this ongoing maintenance?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bramblett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Bramblett"> Well, the difference between ongoing
maintenance and this type of activity, the ongoing maintenance 
basically is trying to make sure that there is no large-scale 
vegetation that appears on the embankments, the earthen 
embankments, that there is regular mowing, that if there are 
routine maintenance activities associated with a trash rack 
that collects trash before it goes into the riser, needs to be 
replaced. Those are examples of regular type of ongoing 
maintenance. This type activity is more of a monitoring for 
public safety.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Yes, sir. I better cut off there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">    I will yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back">Would the gentleman yield for one moment before we dismiss 
our witness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back">The discussion we have had today about all the planning and 
the organization that is going into these structures, the 
maintenance and the emergency plans and everything, it is 
coordinated. The success of this program is really quite 
astounding, whether it would be a Federal Government program or 
anyone else's. But part of the problem we have historically had 
is, in a body where all the grease goes to the squeaky wheel, 
this works so well it is hard to get people's attention about 
maintaining and expanding the success. That is the difficult 
part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back">The gentleman yields back. I yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman yields back">    The chair and the Ranking Member wish to thank the Deputy

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Good morning. My name is Jimmy Emmons. I want
to thank the Committee, Chairman Lucas, Ranking Member Fudge, 
for this opportunity today. It is a great honor, and I do not 
take it lightly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Emmons">I am a farmer and rancher from Dewey County in western 
Oklahoma. My wife Ginger and I farm 2,000 acres of farmland, 
run cattle on about 7,000 acres of rangeland. The Emmons home 
place has been in our family since 1926.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Emmons">I am speaking to you this morning because I serve on the 
District Conservation Board there in Dewey County, the local 
sponsor of two watershed program projects, 22 dams, multiple 
land treatment practices associated with these projects. I live 
and farm around these projects as we speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Emmons">There are more than 600 of these flood protection dams 
within a 75 mile radius of my farm. I am very passionate about 
stewardship and conservation as it relates to our soil and our 
water resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Emmons">It would be easy for me to testify about the rich history 
of the watershed programs in part because western Oklahoma and 
the watershed programs go way back. I can recount one story my 
grandfather told me about a small drainage ditch he started on 
our farm in 1934 that became a gash 40&amp;#127; wide and 50&amp;#127; deep in 
one night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Emmons">That ditch turned out to be a warning sign that we still 
talk about 83 years later known as the deadly Hammond Flood, 
which killed 17. That piece of our history is just one of the 
reasons that Oklahomans now have 2,107 watershed program dams 
and countless conservation practices. The USDA Small Watershed 
Program changed the face of western Oklahoma, and when it did, 
it changed our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Emmons">When I became a grandfather, it sharpened my thinking about 
my future. My 4\1/2\ year old grandson now is my motivation to 
speak up about the watershed programs. The program represents 
an estimated $15 billion investment in conservation 
infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Emmons">As a local project sponsor, it is essential that we are 
good stewards of this investment. This requires a healthy 
Federal, state, local partnership that brings administrative, 
technical, and financial assistance to bear on matters relating 
to the watershed programs infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Emmons">If you travel on the county roads in my area and state 
highways, even Interstate 40, some portion of that road is 
protected by a watershed programs dam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Emmons">The local economy is driven in part by grain, cattle, oil, 
and natural gas that relies daily on this protection. The roads 
and bridges that carry our children to and from school are 
protected by these dams. Our schools, along with other key 
elements in the community, are protected by these dams. The 
partnership between NRCS and local sponsors is critical in 
keeping this protection in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Nationally, in 2018--we have talked about this, this 
morning--will be a milestone of the watershed programs where 
nearly \1/2\ of the 11,840 dams will reach their engineered 
expected life that were constructed by SCS and NRCS. We are 
reaching a critical point this coming year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Emmons">While nine out of ten Oklahomans live and work within 20 
miles of the watershed program dams, many of these folks are 
unaware of the solace that they do. If we let this investment 
in protection slip away it won't take long for them to be 
affected. The watershed programs needs Congressional attention 
if the future Americans want to enjoy the same safety, 
protection, benefits, and productivity the watershed programs 
presently delivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Emmons">In 2000, Representative Lucas led the development of the 
rehabilitation legislation that ensured our nation's investment 
in the watershed programs had the opportunity to continue. The 
legislation gave the Congress the ability to reinvest in these 
structures. Congress has taken the right step in the direction 
with local sponsors. Statewide partners have responded with O&amp;amp;M 
dollars, rehabilitation matching funds, technical and other 
financial assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Emmons">I cannot overemphasize the importance of the Congress, the 
USDA, and NRCS full partnership in the watershed programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Emmons">In closing, where I live, we have something we call farm 
sense. Farm sense is a good thing. Some folks have it; some 
folks don't. Farm sense would tell me, if I invested $750,000 
in a tractor, tillage and seeding equipment, and refused to 
grease that and safely operate that before it goes to the 
field, knowing that that equipment would have a significant 
capital investment that I put into it and still would not 
protect it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Emmons">We have invested $15 billion into conservation 
infrastructure. It is no different. Farm sense tells me that 
Congress needs to reinvest in this important conservation 
program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Thank you.
Prepared Statement of Jimmy Emmons, President, Oklahoma Association of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Conservation Districts, Leedey, OK</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Good morning, my name is Jimmy Emmons, I want to thank the 
Committee, Chairman Lucas and Ranking Member Fudge for the opportunity 
to speak to you today. It is an honor and an opportunity I do not take 
lightly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">I am a farmer and rancher from Dewey County in western Oklahoma 
where my wife Ginger and I farm 2,000 acres of cropland and run cattle 
on 7,000 acres of rangeland. The Emmons home place has been in our 
family since 1926. I'm speaking to you this morning because I serve on 
the Dewey County Conservation District board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">We are local sponsors of two USDA watershed program projects 
(Barnitz Creek and Quartermaster Creek Watersheds) and the 22 project 
dams and the multiple land treatment practices associated with these 
watershed projects. I live and farm in and around these projects. Six 
of the 22 flood control dams in Dewey County are considered high hazard 
dams with the threat of loss of life if the dams were to fail. The 
Dewey County Conservation District with the assistance of NRCS has 
currently rehabilitated four of these dams. (Barnitz Creek Watershed 
Dams No. 1, 5, 11 and 14).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">There are more than 600 of these flood protection dams within a 75 
mile radius of my farm. I am also deeply involved and committed to soil 
and water conservation issues at the local, state and national levels. 
I am passionate about stewardship and conservation as it relates to our 
soil and water resources. I also currently serve as President of the 
Oklahoma Association of Conservation Districts.
Watershed Rehabilitation Program</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Watershed Dam Rehabilitation is a critical component of the 
Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Program. NRCS and its local 
sponsors are responsible for over 11,800 flood control structures 
nationwide. This flood control and conservation related infrastructure 
affects 2,000 watersheds and they represent nearly \1/3\ of all dams 
ever built by the Federal Government. Every year this system saves an 
estimated $2 billion through flood damage prevention. Another way to 
view these benefits is by the number of people and communities who 
benefit directly from watershed projects. The existing projects are 
protecting over 610,000 homes, 46,000 businesses, 180,000 farms and 
ranches, 61,000 bridges, and 28,000 domestic water supplies. As a 
result, over 48 million people across the United States benefit from 
the watershed program every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Many dams today are in a far different setting than when they were 
constructed. Population has increased; residential and commercial 
development has occurred upstream and downstream from the dams; land 
uses have changed; sediment pools have filled; and concrete and metal 
components have deteriorated. Many of these dams do not meet current 
state dam safety regulations that have been enacted and revised with 
more stringent requirements than when the dams were built. In addition, 
many of these structures built by NRCS had a design life of only 50 
years. Since most of this construction occurred from the 1940's to the 
early 1970's, many of these dams are now past their design life and are 
in need of rehabilitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Chances are as you travel in my area whether on county roads, State 
Highways or Interstate 40 some portion of the road you travel receives 
flood protection from an upstream USDA Small Watershed Program Flood 
Control dam. The local economy that is driven in part by grain, cattle, 
oil and natural gas relies daily on this protection. The roads and 
bridges that carry our children to and from school are protected. In 
several cases the school itself along with other key elements of 
community are protected. Just as it is across much of the nation, the 
water that these flood control lakes collect is also essential to our 
economy and quality of life in western Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Many of our most productive farms and our healthiest soils are 
located in these protected watersheds. There are many less obvious 
benefits that come in the form of the prosperity and opportunity made 
possible by these projects. The partnership between USDA and local 
sponsors that brought us this protection is extremely important in 
keeping it in place. CY 2018 will be a milestone year for the watershed 
program when more than 50% of the 11,840 dams engineered and 
constructed by SCS/NRCS will have exceeded their original evaluated 
life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Nine out of ten Oklahomans live or work within 20 miles of a 
watershed program dam. These folks may be unaware of the watershed 
program, but if we let this investment in protection slip away it won't 
take long for them to be affected. I'm sure a similar statement could 
be made for our neighboring states. The watershed program needs 
Congressional attention if current and future Americans are to enjoy 
the same safety, protection, benefits, and productivity the watershed 
program has given us. Rehabilitation is necessary to ensure dams 
continue to protect lives, businesses and homes. Failure to provide 
rehabilitation of these dams could result in dam breaches which would 
have catastrophic consequences. The flooding crisis and potential 
failure of the Oroville Dam in California this past February 
illustrates the need for infrastructure operation, maintenance and 
repair of dams. While Oroville Dam is not an NRCS dam its does show 
what could happen when dams are not properly repaired or maintained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">In 2000, Mr. Lucas led the development of rehabilitation 
legislation that ensured the nation's investment in the watershed 
program had the opportunity to continue into the future. Under the Dam 
Rehabilitation Program, dams are selected for rehabilitation through a 
competitive grant process and Federal are funds are limited to 65% of a 
project's cost. This commitment from state and local partners is 
necessary to ensure that sponsors are fully committed to a project. 
This legislation gave us the pathway and the procedure for 
reinvestment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">As the significantly invested local sponsors of watershed projects, 
state and local partners have felt that we have suffered from an 
inadequately funded Federal partner for much of the past decade. In my 
opinion, Congress has taken a step in the right direction by wisely 
investing through the 2014 Farm Bill and the 2017 Omnibus 
Appropriations bill. Local sponsors and state watershed program 
partners have responded with O&amp;amp;M dollars, rehabilitation matching 
funds, technical and financial assistance. I cannot over emphasize the 
importance of Congress and the USDA-NRCS as full partners in the 
watershed program. We hope these recent investments are a signal to 
USDA about the importance of these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">It would be easy for me to spend my time before you this morning 
talking about the rich history of the watershed program in my part of 
the world because western Oklahoma and the watershed program go way 
back. I could recount the story my grandfather shared about a small 
drainage ditch across our farm that in 1934 became a gash in the 
landscape 40&amp;#127; wide and 25&amp;#127; deep literally overnight. Folks in the area 
still talk about the deadly Hammon Flood that killed 17 Oklahomans. 
That flood, that piece of our history, is just one of the reasons that 
Oklahoma is now covered with 2,107 watershed program dams and countless 
conservation practices. The USDA Small Watershed Program changed the 
face of western Oklahoma and when it did . . . it also changed our 
future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">When I became a grandfather it sure sharpened my thinking about the 
future. My 4\1/2\ year old grandson, a budding farmer and rancher in 
his own right, is my motivation to talk to you about the present and 
the future as it relates to the benefits the watershed program 
continues to bring to our nation. The program represents an estimated 
$15 billion investment in conservation infrastructure. As responsible 
citizens and local project sponsors, it is essential that we are good 
stewards of this previous investment. This requires a robust Federal, 
state and local partnership that brings administrative, technical and 
financial assistance to bear on matters relating to this infrastructure 
created by the watershed program. From routine operation, maintenance 
and repairs to full-fledged dam rehabilitation each of the partners has 
an important and specific role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">In closing, where I live there's something we call ``Farm Sense''. 
Farm sense is a good thing. Some folks have it, some don't. A day or 2 
on the farm quickly reveals who has a good measure of farm sense. A 
person with farm sense wouldn't invest $750,000 in a new tractor and 
tillage equipment and then refuse to grease the equipment every time it 
goes to the field, fail to change belts, hoses, filters and fluids 
regularly or leave it parked outside where the tires can dry rot in the 
sun and the mice and packrats can devour the wiring. Knowing they 
depend on that equipment and have lots of capital tied up in it they 
would take care of it and do everything they could to hold its value 
and protect the investment. A $15 billion investment in conservation 
infrastructure is no different. Farm sense tells us its time for the 
partnership to reinvest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">As the Subcommittee moves toward the next farm bill and the 2018 
budget bill comes into focus I encourage you to support and provide 
adequate funding for new watershed projects and for the rehabilitation 
of aging watershed dams. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Attachment
Flood Control Dams in Dewey County</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Oklahoma has 2,107 flood control dams in 61 counties. These dams 
have been constructed through local watershed project sponsors with 
financial and technical assistance from the USDA Natural Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS) authorized through Public Law 78-534 
(Washita River Watershed) and Public Law 83-566 Watershed Protection 
and Flood Prevention Program. Twenty-two of these dams are in Dewey 
County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">The primary purpose of flood control dams is to reduce flooding. 
The secondary benefits of the dams address a myriad of public needs 
such as water supply, water quality, soil health, water management, 
wetland enhancement, fish and wildlife habitat, and recreation. Flood 
control dams improve public safety, contribute to a healthy economy and 
support a strong nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Watershed projects also include the installation of natural 
resource conservation practices such as terraces, waterways, ponds, 
gully repair, and pasture and rangeland plantings. These conservation 
practices improve water quality and soil health and reduce 
sedimentation into the lakes formed by the dams.
Operation and Maintenance of Dams</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">The annual operation and maintenance of dams is the responsibility 
of project sponsors (local units of governments such as conservation 
districts).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Operation is the administrative and management activities necessary 
to ensure the dams function as designed and remain safe. Operation work 
includes annual dam inspections and inspection immediately following 
heavy rains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Maintenance work includes removing trees from dams and spillways, 
repairing erosion damage, repairing damage to the spillway and dams 
after heavy rainstorms, and keeping the principal spillway inlet towers 
cleared of debris.
Operation and Maintenance Needs</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Operation and maintenance of dams can be expensive and labor 
intensive. $4 million is needed to operate and maintain all 2,107 flood 
control each year. Only through continued investment in operation and 
maintenance will future generations enjoy the promise of safety these 
dams offer.
Annual Benefits</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">The 2,107 flood control dams and conservation practices in 
watershed projects provide $91 million in average annual benefits. The 
table on the back of this page lists the annual benefits provided by 
watershed projects in Dewey County.
Rehabilitation and Dam Safety</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">As dams age some will need rehabilitation to remain safe and 
protect the people that live or work downstream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">At the conclusion of 2016, 260 flood control dams in the state have 
been classified as high hazard. Of these 115 do not meet current state 
or federal safety criteria. Approximately $300 million is needed to 
upgrade the 115 dams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">Six of the 22 dams in Dewey County are classified as high hazard 
and have the potential for loss of life if they should fail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">The number of high hazard dams will continue to increase as long as 
residential and business development is allowed downstream of the dam 
in the breach flood area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">NRCS can provide 65 percent of the rehabilitation costs and 
technical assistance to rehabilitate high hazard dams. Local project 
sponsors provide 35 percent of the cost and obtain any needed 
additional land rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Emmons ">As of December 2016 thirty-five dams in the state have been 
rehabilitated and 18 others are in various stages of planning, design 
or construction.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. KEVIN BURNS">The chair now recognizes the Honorable Kevin Burns for 5 
minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. KEVIN BURNS">                       TEXAS, DECATUR, TX
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Burns">Chairman Lucas, Ranking Member Fudge, and other
Members, thank you very much for this opportunity to speak 
today. I am Kevin Burns from Decatur, Texas. I have been 
serving the citizens of Wise County for 15 years as County 
Commissioner. I have been a teacher, a volunteer fireman, 
small-business owner, small rancher. And I still raise some 
cattle and hay crops in a small way in Wise County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Burns">I am the past chair of the National Watershed Coalition. It 
supports watershed sponsors with training through conferences, 
materials, and then some boots-on-the-ground, hands-on training 
in operation and maintenance in cooperation with NRCS, and I 
have enjoyed that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Burns">My written testimony contains some national facts and 
figures about the benefits of the watershed programs, but what 
I really want to share with you today is, and why I traveled 
here, is just to talk about what happens on a daily basis in my 
experiences in Wise County and what it means to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Burns">Wise County has 108 flood control structures in our little 
900\2\ mile county. We have 85 dams that normally contain a 
pool of water, and I learned today that that the slow release 
was 10 days. I didn't know that until today. I just knew that 
they worked very well. We have 23 grade stabilization 
structures that are just small levees with V-cuts to either 
slow or direct the flow of water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Burns">I was lucky enough when I ran for Commissioner that the 
late former Wise County Judge Charles Wilhite came see me. This 
old family friend can to me with a little different attitude. 
He wanted to give me a little education, telling me that at the 
time we had 80 dams in the county. He also told me about a 
regional multi-state drought that we had between 1950 and 1957.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Burns">Our economy in Wise County was mostly agricultural based, 
so most of the folks had to move into the city to get a job. 
Our economy was terrible. What little commerce was going on in 
the county was killed overnight, or almost overnight, by 
rainfall in 1957. It rained 24". It washed out 85 bridges in 
the county. What little was going on came to a halt. That was 
catastrophic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Burns">The county had yet to invest anything locally in P.L. 83-
566. The problem was solvable, and they had chose, because of 
budget, not to invest. It was in our best interest, obviously, 
at the time, that we needed to start investing. In 1961 we 
completed our first project and went on from there. We are well 
protected now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Burns">A major part of my responsibilities is roads. We have 990 
miles in our county. I maintain 340 of them in my precinct. 
Forty-six of those flood control structures are in my precinct 
because of the highly erodible soils and the change of 
elevation. They are near and dear to my heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Burns">The importance of those dams was exemplified in 2015, in 
the spring. Our yearly average rainfall fell in the month of 
May that year. We had nine washouts in my precinct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Burns">Now, realize the difference here: 85 bridges washed out in 
1957, and now just nine small washouts. And those nine small 
washouts were in areas unprotected by P.L. 83-566 dams. They 
are incredibly effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Burns">I have heard arguments that these P.L. 83-566 dollars, it 
needs to be a local investment and not a national investment. 
But we do put skin in the game. We put in conservation 
practices above these dams. We get the right-of-ways. And it is 
just not local benefits. Those benefits go downstream. There 
are areas outside of our county, other counties. And the lakes 
that are formed provide recreational opportunities, and two 
major lakes downstream from my county provide the water 
supplies for the City of Fort Worth and surrounding Tarrant 
County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Burns">The NRCS district really needs to plan and do some new 
projects. We have several deficiencies in my county. My story 
of this program benefiting my county is one of thousands across 
the nation. I appreciate you letting me share it with you. As 
you move forward in the 2018 Farm Bill, I encourage you to 
provide adequate funding for this program. It is much needed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Burns ">4I'm Kevin Burns from Decatur, Texas. First, thank you all for the 
opportunity to speak today. I've had the privilege of serving the 
citizens of Wise County almost 15 years as County Commissioner. I've 
been a teacher, a volunteer fireman, small business owner, and small 
rancher prior to running for local office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Burns ">I serve the State of Texas on the Board of Directors for the 
conference of urban counties. Wise County is not considered an urban 
county having only about 70,000 people in 900\2\ miles, but our growth 
rate and proximity to the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex qualify us to join 
that group. I'm a past chair of the National Watershed Coalition, which 
supports Watershed sponsors with training through regional conferences, 
hands on training, and resource materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Burns ">I still raise cattle and hay crops in rural Wise County near 
Decatur, TX. I've never thought of myself as a conservationist, but I 
was taught to maintain land that I owned or leased and to be conscious 
that the practices we do on the land affects its productivity in the 
future. That stewardship of our nation's resources is one of the things 
I wish to talk to you about today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Burns ">While the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) may be 
better known for providing a financial safety net for farmers and 
ranchers, USDA also provides an actual safety net for our rural 
communities. The Watershed and Flood Prevention Program (watershed 
program) is a vital, but often overlooked, infrastructure program 
within the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) portfolio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Burns ">The watershed program authorizes NRCS to work with local units of 
government, like conservation districts and city/county governments, to 
install watershed protection and improvement projects that provide 
communities with flood prevention, agriculture water management, 
municipal water supply management, fish and wildlife habitat 
enhancement, as well as public recreation development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Burns ">These projects create and protect vital infrastructure while 
conserving natural resources and contributing to local economies. The 
watershed program focuses on both the design and construction of 
structural water control measures and on land treatment measures. 
Watershed planning provides a basis for partnering at state and local 
levels to identify and co-invest in projects reflecting the highest 
priority needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Burns ">Flood prevention and reliable water quality created by the 
watershed program are essential to developing and maintaining strong 
rural communities. Watershed projects not only protect lives, property 
and reduce flood damages, but also create economic growth and 
strengthen local economies. Flood protection is essential to prevent 
the unnecessary loss of infrastructure and capital to developing 
economies in rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Burns ">Investing in the watershed program expands opportunities for 
natural resource conservation and provides important national economic 
and environmental dividends for all Americans. There are countless 
successful examples that verify the value the watershed program brings 
to rural areas in the form of water supply, recreation, flood 
protection, and sustainable economic development. Watershed program 
projects are an economic engine that make participating communities 
more productive places to live, work and play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Burns ">More than 11,800 flood control structures have been constructed in 
2,000 watersheds nationwide and they represent nearly \1/3\ of all dams 
ever built by the Federal Government. Every project requires that a 
portion of the watershed must be covered with installed best management 
conservation practices. Every year this system of flood control lakes 
and conservation measures protects over 47 million Americans and saves 
an estimated $2 billion through flood damage reduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Burns ">In a recent report to Congress,\1\ NRCS estimates that this 
program, by avoiding and reducing flood damages, annually provides more 
than $352 million in benefits to agriculture and more than $462 million 
in benefits to non-agricultural uses, such as roads, bridges, and 
homes. Other benefits, such as erosion control, water conservation, 
water quality improvement and irrigation efficiency, exceed $441 
million on agricultural lands and over $957 million in recreation, fish 
and wildlife, rural water supply, and municipal and industrial water 
supply, annually.

Prevention Program Multi-Year Plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Burns ">The watershed program also plays an important role in protecting 
resources vital to the agricultural economy as well. Agricultural water 
management includes measures that help to manage water supply for 
agriculture and rural communities. Measures include drainage water 
management, ground water recharge, irrigation management, water 
conservation, water quality improvement, and rural water supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Burns ">The watershed program is federally-assisted, but locally planned 
and implemented. Local project sponsors use local resources to maintain 
constructed project measures which contribute directly to a stronger 
national economy and a responsible national environmental future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Burns ">Wise County has 108 flood control structures built under authority 
of Public Law 83-566 established by the United States Congress in the 
mid 1950s. We have 85 dams that normally contain a small pool of water 
and a larger pool with a slow controlled release during flood 
conditions. We have 23 grade stabilization structures that merely 
retard or direct water flow. These dams protect our county roadways 
which is a major portion of my responsibility as County Commissioner. 
My county has 990 miles of road. I am responsible for the maintenance 
of 340 miles in Precinct 2. Forty-six of those 108 dams are in my 
Precinct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Burns ">I was lucky enough to be visited by the late former Wise County 
Judge Charles Wilhite during my first campaign. Judge Wilhite stressed 
the importance of the P.L. 83-566 program and gave me a short local 
history lesson that I would like to share with you. There was a 
regional/multi state drought from 1950 to 1957 that brought 
considerable hardship to our region. Our local economy was mostly 
agriculture based. It was tough to make a living, so a large portion of 
population moved from the area to find jobs in the city. That drought 
was relieved almost overnight in a flood in 1957.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Burns ">What little commerce going on in the county was further hindered 
due to that 24" rainfall over a weekend in 1957 that washed out 85 
bridges in my county alone. Even though the population had dwindled and 
revenues were low, the commissioner's court, the Wise County Water 
Control and Improvement District, and the Wise County Soil and Water 
Conservation District started investing local match funds and 
participating in the P.L. 83-566 programs, with our first project 
completed in 1961.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Burns ">I am fortunate to live in an area in which there continues to be 
cooperation between those and other entities to maintain our flood 
control dams. The importance of those dams was exemplified in the 
flooding in my county in the spring of 2015. We received more than our 
yearly average of rainfall in the month of May that year. We had a 14" 
rainfall in one afternoon in a small area of Precinct 2 and only had 
nine road washouts that made roads impassable. Please note the 
difference here; we had nine spots that were impassable opposed to the 
85 bridges that were washed out prior to the dams being built. All of 
those washouts were in watersheds not yet protected by P.L. 83-566 
projects. All roads were passable in Precinct 2 in the drainage 
protected by P.L. 83-566 dams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Burns ">I've heard arguments against funding the P.L. 83-566 program that 
claim that it should be funded with local dollars. Local project 
sponsors do provide their share of the cost of projects in providing 
easements, right of ways, the cost of installing conservation 
practices, cost of working with landowners and more. But the benefits 
of these projects are not all local. These projects provide benefits 
many miles downstream often in other counties or even other states. 
These projects provide not just local benefits, but state and national 
benefits. Many of the lakes formed by flood control dams provide 
recreational areas, water supplies and hunting and fishing 
opportunities that are utilized by people from many miles away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Burns ">Another benefit of the watershed program is the enhancement of 
water quality in urban areas. We recently developed a relationship with 
the Tarrant Regional Water District to help us maintain our dams and 
install conservation practices. The water district serves an area 
downstream from the watershed projects in Wise County that includes the 
majority of the population in Congressional District 12 and a small 
portion in District 13. Watershed projects and conservation practices 
in Wise County help protect both water quantity and quality in two 
major lakes downstream managed by the water district. These lakes 
provide water supplies for the City of Fort Worth and other areas of 
Tarrant County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Burns ">My passion for the program was cultivated when first taking office 
by former Commissioner's Court members and conservation district 
members that lived through the floods in 1957, but now it is reinforced 
by the demonstrated benefits during my term in office. There are 
opportunities to provide benefits to many more citizens in this country 
through the P.L. 83-566 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Burns ">    The recently passed FY 2017 Appropriations bill acknowledges the 
need for this important infrastructure program and appropriated $150 
million for Watershed Operations. We thank Congress for that support. 
As Members of Congress, you are key partners in extending the benefits 
of the watershed program. Your support for the program is vital. Thank 
you.

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Peterson">Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, I
am representing the Land Improvement Contractors of America 
today, and it is our contractors that have installed many of 
these watershed dams throughout our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Peterson">In my previous years with the Soil Conservation Service I 
also have planned projects, designed dams, constructed dams as 
a project engineer, and directed the watershed programs 
nationally. While serving as the Executive Director of the 
National Watershed Coalition, I worked with Chairman Lucas as 
he championed the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Peterson">I am now also Chairman of the Northern Virginia Soil and 
Water Conservation District, and we have a watershed project in 
our district that has had four dams rehabilitated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Peterson">There are about 2,100 watershed projects in the United 
States covering 145 million acres of projects in every state; 
11,845 dams have been constructed. The total average annual 
benefits is nearly $2.3 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Peterson">Conservation practices are a vital part of each of these 
projects. They also increase the service life of the dams by 
reducing sediment accumulation. There are watershed dams in 218 
Congressional districts. The watershed as the logical unit for 
dealing with natural resource problems has long been 
recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Peterson">In 1993, record flooding occurred across the Midwest, 50 
deaths occurred, and damages approached $15 billion. I also 
managed the emergency watershed programs then and was involved 
in that disaster recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Peterson">After the floods passed, Iowa looked at their watershed 
projects and the flood damage reports in four of their 
counties, and the result was graphic. The areas that had 
watershed projects installed requested far less disaster 
assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Peterson">A program evaluation also demonstrated that the actual 
benefits of costs in these projects was about 2.2:1, and the 
studies showed that more benefits were obtained than had been 
originally claimed. The actual adjusted economic benefits 
exceeded those planned by 34 percent. And those numbers are 
low, because many of these projects have exceeded their 
evaluation life, and the benefits continue long after.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Peterson">When properly maintained, these dams will provide benefits 
indefinitely. In addition, there is more infrastructure 
protected today than there was when the projects were planned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Peterson">Chairman Lucas' Oklahoma has been a leader in these 
watershed projects. Oklahoma has 129 projects in 64 counties. 
These projects contain 2,107 dams and provide Oklahomans with 
$91.5 million in average annual benefits. Ranking Member 
Fudge's Ohio has 27 watershed projects covering over 1.8 
million acres; 77 dams have been built.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Peterson">Ohio also has many nonstructural watershed projects 
underway. Twenty-four of Ohio's 77 dams are high hazard, and 
some need to be rehabilitated to meet current dam safety 
standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Peterson">I am also very proud of my own watershed Pohick project 
just across the Potomac River. This was the first project 
planned in the United States where the watershed was being 
converted totally from rural to urban use. All the dams are 
planned as high-hazard structures, and the project also 
developed new guidelines for erosion and sediment control in 
urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Peterson">The Pohick project is operated and maintained by Fairfax 
County, and I would invite your Subcommittee Members to come 
over across the river sometime and visit us. We will give you a 
tour, and you would be very impressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Peterson">So why should the Federal Government be involved with these 
watershed programs? Well, they are not federally owned but 
federally assisted and locally owned. They are locally 
initiated. They consider environmental values. They address the 
needs of low-income and minority communities. And best of all, 
they are programs people actually like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Peterson">Local conservation districts, the NRCS, and state 
conservation agencies combine to make a very effective delivery 
system for providing technical assistance to people. But that 
delivery system is currently strained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Peterson">A healthy Federal partner is critical to this partnership. 
A delivery system is in place, but by continually downsizing 
NRCS, we are eroding the most effective and efficient means of 
working with people that has ever been developed anywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Peterson">This system and its ability to produce food and fiber is 
the envy of the entire world. In my view, these watershed 
infrastructure programs are national priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Peterson">Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue recently wrote, 
``According to a new Chamber poll, fully 70 percent of 
Americans want the Federal Government to invest in 
infrastructure.'' Our watershed project infrastructure should 
be a major part of that investment.</paragraph>

Opening</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I am John W. Peterson 
from Burke, VA, and I am honored to be asked to testify on the value 
and benefits of USDA's Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act 
(P.L. 83-566), the Flood Control Act (P.L. 78-534), and the Watershed 
Rehabilitation Amendments of 2000 (P.L. 106-472), representing The Land 
Improvement Contractors of America (LICA). LICA Member contractors have 
constructed many of our nation's flood control dams, and helped install 
most of the other conservation practices on our farms and ranches. I 
present this testimony in support of what I consider the most 
beneficial water resource conservation infrastructure programs ever 
developed in the United States. LICA understands full well the need to 
use our tax dollars wisely. That makes the work of your Subcommittee 
very important. It also makes it imperative that the Federal programs 
we have are those that provide real benefit to society, and are not 
programs that would be nice to have if funds were unlimited. LICA 
believes these watershed programs are examples of those rare programs 
that address our nation's vital natural resources infrastructure, do so 
in a way that provide benefits in excess of costs, and are programs 
that serve as models for the way all Federal programs should work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">I will admit my bias in support of these beneficial programs. In my 
40 years with the old Soil Conservation Service (SCS), called the 
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) since 1994, I have 
planned watershed projects in MN, OH, IN, and AZ; designed watershed 
dams in MN, OH and IN, constructed watershed dams as a project engineer 
in MN, and directed the watershed program nationally for USDA in 
Washington, D.C. After retiring from USDA, and while serving as the 
Executive Director of the National Watershed Coalition (NWC), I worked 
with Oklahoma Representatives Lucas and Watkins, and the late Senator 
Paul Coverdell (GA) and Senator Blanche Lincoln (AR), as Chairman Lucas 
championed the passage the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Amendments of 
2000, P.L. 106-472. A good friend, Dr. Dan Sebert from Pawnee, OK, 
replaced me as the NWC Executive Director. He and the NWC are extremely 
good watershed program references. Coming full-cycle, I am also now the 
Chairman of the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District 
(NVSWCD). Our District is the cosponsor of the Pohick Watershed 
Project, along with Fairfax County. Four of our Pohick Watershed's six 
flood-control structures have been rehabilitated in recent years, some 
with assistance from the Rehabilitation Act. I believe my watershed 
program experience has given me a perspective that I hope is helpful to 
you.
General Watershed Program Observations</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">There are about 2,100 Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) 
assisted watershed projects in the Unites States, covering 145 million 
acres, with projects in every state. In 1,271 of these projects, 11,845 
flood control (or floodwater retarding) dams have been constructed by 
local watershed sponsors with NRCS assistance. In most cases, a local 
Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) is one of the local 
sponsors. In some cases, they are assisted by other cosponsors such as 
watershed districts or county government. The total average annual 
monetary benefits these projects produce is $2,257,132,064 (2016 
dollars). Nearly $2.3 billion. That is very significant! I have 
attached a listing of the number of watershed dams located in each 
state as attachment. In addition, over 282,000 acres of wetlands and 
over 9 million acres of upland wildlife habitat has been created or 
enhanced by watershed projects. Conservation practices that improve 
water quality are a vital part of all watershed projects. Practices 
such as terraces, waterways, grass buffers, strip cropping, and grade 
stabilization structures, are used to prevent soil erosion and reduce 
sediment. They also increase the service life of dams and their ability 
to provide flood damage reduction. There are watershed project dams in 
218 Congressional Districts across the nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">Note that I called these flood control dams floodwater retarding 
dams. I am sure you all remember the Great Midwest Flood of 1993. From 
May through September of 1993 record flooding occurred across ND, SD, 
NE, KS, MN, IA, MO, WI and IL. 50 deaths occurred and damages 
approached $15 billion. I also managed USDA Emergency Watershed Program 
then, and was involved in USDA's disaster assistance to the damaged 
areas. This flood wasn't caused by a single rainfall event, but was 
more of a prolonged hydro-meteorological event. The rains came to the 
area, stalled, and stayed for months. One thing that flood event taught 
me is that we humans don't really control floods. We are very good at 
reducing flood damages, but we do not control floods. Since then I have 
referred to these watershed dams as floodwater retarding dams, not 
flood control dams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">However, the Great Midwest Flood also proved the many benefits of 
the watershed programs. After the floods passed, my SCS colleagues in 
IA, one of the states effected, looked at watershed projects and 1993 
flood damage reports in four Iowa Counties, Crawford, Union, Mills, and 
Decatur. The result was graphic. The areas that had watershed projects 
installed requested far less disaster assistance.\1\ Roger Schnoor, who 
at that time was the President of the Iowa Watersheds organization (now 
disbanded) said ``These watershed projects stood out like protected 
islands in a sea of damage.''

    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">\1\ An Iowa NRCS PDF showing Crawford, Union, Mills and Decatur 
Counties entitled ``Watershed Projects and 1993 Flood Damage Reports in 
Four Iowa Counties.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">This is just one of several such evaluations that occur across the 
country that have demonstrated that watershed projects significantly 
reduce the need for emergency recovery following major floods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">The USDA assisted watershed programs address multiple natural 
resource objectives. Objectives that can be addressed are flood damage 
reduction, watershed protection (erosion and sediment control), water 
quality improvement, rural water supply, water conservation, fish and 
wildlife habitat improvement, recreation, irrigation, water management, 
groundwater recharge, etc. That is flexibility emphasizing multiple 
uses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">People should understand these Federal watershed program funds are 
only a part of the total that is committed to this vital national, 
conservation purpose. The local project sponsors in these ``federally 
assisted'' endeavors also have a tremendous investment. As a minimum, 
they provide all the land, easements, and rights-of-way costs for 
construction of the structures, as well as being responsible for 100% 
of the operation and maintenance costs for the life of the structure. 
Congress increasingly talks of wanting to fund those investments in our 
nation's infrastructure that will sustain us in the future. Water 
quality and watershed infrastructure management provide that 
sustainability, and should be a national priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">My colleagues on this panel have done an excellent job of telling 
you about the programs themselves. I will concentrate on what these 
projects have done, their benefits. And those benefits are very 
substantial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">I will start by mentioning the results of a complete watershed 
program evaluation. The most current program evaluation I know of,\2\ 
demonstrated the actual ratio of benefits to costs in all those 
projects completed as planned, was approximately 2.2:1. And the study 
showed that more benefits were obtained from these projects than had 
been originally claimed. The actual adjusted economic benefits exceeded 
the planned benefits by 34%.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">\2\ Evaluation of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention 
Program, USDA-SCS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">The watershed projects produce $2,257,000,000 in average annual 
benefits (2016 dollars). And those benefits are low because many of 
these projects have exceeded their ``evaluation life'' (the economic 
evaluation that calculates when the anticipated benefits will have 
repaid the projects costs), and when properly maintained, repaired, and 
failing components replaced, those dams will continue providing 
benefits indefinitely. In addition, there is considerably more 
infrastructure being protected by these projects today than when they 
were first planned. Properly maintained, our U.S. watershed program 
dams will serve us far longer than their economic evaluated life. And I 
would add that 2018 is a milestone year in the watershed program as 
more than 50% of the projects dams will have exceeded their evaluated 
life, and their benefits continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">The evaluation also mentioned that the projects provided a wide 
range of social benefits, benefits that enhance the quality of people's 
lives. Many of these benefits are not included in the calculation of 
monetary effects because of the difficulty in assigning monetary 
values. Yet these social benefits cannot be ignored simply because 
quantification is difficult. Some of these societal benefits are 
reducing;
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; the threat of loss of life.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; health hazards such as insect breeding pools, sewage</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">overflows, and chronic wet conditions that are particularly</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">hazardous to the elderly and children.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; significant risk and inconvenience associated with damage to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">roads and bridges.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; disruption of necessary services such as police and fire</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">protection, and the need for emergency equipment.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; pollution of drinking water.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; pollution of water used for water-based recreation.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; interruptions of utilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">What if other Federal programs did so well? Recent budget proposals 
to limit funding for the Watershed Operations and Watershed 
Rehabilitation Programs which help communities improve water quality, 
control erosion, reduce flood damages, protect people's lives, and 
improve local infrastructure, is short sighted. There are also 
proposals to reduce funding for USDA's Conservation Technical 
Assistance (CTA) Program, the very lifeblood of voluntary conservation 
in the United States. These proposals would eliminate programs that 
produce net benefits to society as a whole. That simply makes no sense. 
We in the conservation community should talk more about how these 
programs benefit all of society, not just in rural areas, but 
everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">One other national benefit worth mentioning is the availability of 
DamWatch, a new web-based application that provides real-time 
monitoring of rainfall, snowmelt, stream flow, and seismic events that 
could pose potential threats to dam safety. It will help watershed 
project sponsors monitor and manage dams so they can better prevent and 
protect against hazardous, costly and potentially catastrophic events.
Project Benefits in Select States</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">Chairman Lucas's Oklahoma has long been a leader in these watershed 
programs. OK has 129 watershed projects in 64 counties. These projects 
contain 2107 flood damage reduction dams, and provide Oklahoman's with 
$91.5 million in average annual monetary benefits. And Chairman Lucas's 
3rd Congressional District has 1,040 dams providing his district with 
$34.5 million in average annual monetary benefits. Oklahoma is probably 
the best state in having good watershed historical information. Much of 
that is due to the work of a good friend Larry Caldwell, P.E. (NRCS 
Retired), who has personally kept that information current. He also 
keeps national information current.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">Ranking Member Fudge's Ohio has also been active. There are 27 
watershed projects in Ohio covering over 1.8 million acres. To date 77 
floodwater retarding dams have been built. Ohio also has a number of 
non-structural watershed projects underway. Twenty-four of Ohio's 77 
dams are classified as high hazard, and some do need to be 
rehabilitated to meet current dam safety standards. The current cost 
estimate for upgrading all Ohio's watershed dams to meet Ohio Dam Law 
is $6.3 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">In my own Commonwealth of Virginia, NRCS has assisted sponsors with 
construction of 109 single-purpose flood control dams and 41 multiple-
purpose structures. Dams have been installed in 35 watersheds within 27 
counties across Virginia at an original cost of over $151 million. Over 
time, the recreational benefits have exceeded the levels expected 
during the planning process for many of the sites that were built. Of 
the 41 multiple-purpose structures, 25 were built with recreation as a 
purpose. Of those, 11 have public access recreational facilities. Ten 
of the 15 structures built with water supply as the only secondary 
purpose also have public recreation. The big surprise was that 16 of 
the single-purpose flood control dams also have public recreation 
facilities. Together, 25% of the dams have public access recreation. 
Fishing, boating, camping, hiking, and bird watching are just a few of 
the recreational benefits. From the social perspective, the dams have 
become part of the fabric of the community. In several places, there 
are lake-based events that bring tourism into the county. All of these 
activities bring value to the community that is measured not only in 
the associated economics, but in giving an appreciation of nature, 
improving physical and mental health, and contributing to the quality 
of life. NRCS can be proud of the way that the people have made these 
reservoirs a part of their daily lives. In addition to flood damage 
reduction, 15 of these structures provide community water supply and 37 
are used for public recreation. Between 2005 and 2016, NRCS also helped 
communities rehabilitate ten of those dams at a total project cost of 
over $22.3 million.
A Very Unique Project, Pohick Watershed, Fairfax County, VA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">I am very proud of a watershed project just across the Potomac 
River in Fairfax, County, VA, in the shadow of our nation's Capital. It 
is the Pohick Creek Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Project 
\3\ whose sponsors are my own Northern Virginia Soil and Water 
Conservation District which I serve as Chairman, and Fairfax County, 
represented by the Department of Public Works and Environmental 
Services (DPWES), and County Park Authority (PA). The original Work 
Plan calculated the b/c ratio to be 1.4:1. The watershed area is 22,690 
acres, and the watershed population in 1965 was only 4,767 people. In 
2000 the population had grown to 117,000, and it is about 150,000 
today, in a County of nearly 1.2 million, about 14% of the state's 
population and the most populous County in the Commonwealth. This 
project planning began in 1965 when erosion from construction activity 
had virtually destroyed several residential lakes. In addition, a 
multimillion-dollar sewer referendum opened up the Pohick Watershed for 
residential and commercial development. These circumstances caused 
public concern that rapid conversion of land from rural to urban uses 
was creating irreversible damage to streams and the pleasant hillsides. 
Planning this watershed project resulted in many national firsts. This 
was the first watershed project planned in a watershed being converted 
totally from rural to urban land use. All the dams were planned as 
high-hazard structures providing protection from the 100 year frequency 
storms downstream. And the project brought forth new guidelines for 
erosion and sediment control (land treatment) in urban situations. An 
erosion and sediment control ordinance was passed by the county in 
1967. That ordinance later became the model for the erosion and 
sediment control law passed by the Commonwealth of VA in 1967. In 
addition to dealing with urban erosion and sediment control, the 
project contains six floodwater retarding dams. The County says the 
major benefits of the project are that it:

Why Watershed Programs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">The watershed as the logical unit for dealing with natural resource 
problems has long been recognized. P.L. 83-566 offers a complete 
watershed management approach, and should have a prominent place in our 
current Federal policy emphasizing watersheds and total resource 
management based planning. Proper watershed management improves water 
quality. Why should the Federal Government be involved with these 
watershed infrastructure programs?
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They are infrastructure programs whose objectives are the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">sustaining of our nation's precious natural resources for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">generations to come.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They are not federally owned, but federally assisted,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">locally sponsored and owned, operated and maintained. They do</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">not represent the continued growth of the Federal Government.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They are locally initiated and driven. Decisions are made by</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">people affected, and respect private property rights.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They share costs between the Federal Government and local</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">people. Local sponsors pay between 30-40% of the total costs of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">P.L. 83-566 projects.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They produce net benefits to society.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They consider and enhance environmental values. Projects are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">subject to the discipline of being planned following the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Federal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">``Principles and Guidelines'' for land and water projects. That</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">is public scrutiny!
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They are flexible infrastructure programs that can adapt to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">changing needs and priorities.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They are programs that encourage all citizens to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">participate.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They can address the needs of low-income and minority</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">communities.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; They are targeted to address the most serious resource</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">problems.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; And best of all--they are programs the people like!</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">Every state in the United States has benefited from the Small 
Watershed Program.
Some Suggestions</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">There are some suggestions I would like to make concerning this 
very important watershed legislation. I believe the objectives of this 
legislation should be expanded to include more non-structural water 
quality practices, and allow the law to provide cost-sharing in 
developing rural water supplies (without water there is no rural 
development).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">With the ``downsizing'' the NRCS has experienced, I would be remiss 
if I did not express concern as to their ability to provide adequate 
technical support to these watershed programs. NRCS technical staff has 
been significantly reduced, and budget constraints have not allowed 
that expertise to be replaced. Traditional fields of engineering and 
economics are but two examples where expertise has been lost. I see 
many states where NRCS capability to support their responsibilities is 
seriously diminished. This is a disturbing trend that should be halted. 
This downsizing has a very serious effect on state and local 
conservation programs. Local Watershed and Conservation Districts and 
the NRCS combine to make a very effective delivery system for providing 
the technical assistance to local people--farmers, ranchers and rural 
communities--in applying needed conservation practices and watershed 
programs. But that delivery system is currently strained! A healthy 
Federal partner is critical to this partnership success. Many states 
and local units of government also have complementary programs that 
provide financial assistance to land owners and operators for 
installing measures that reduce erosion, improve water quality, and 
maintain environmental quality. The NRCS provides conservation 
districts, through agreement with the USDA Secretary of Agriculture, 
``on the land'' technical assistance for applying these measures. The 
delivery system currently is in place, and by downsizing NRCS, we are 
eroding the most effective and efficient coordinated means of working 
with local people to solve environmental problems that has ever been 
developed. Our system and its ability to produce food and fiber is the 
envy of the entire world. In my view, these watershed infrastructure 
programs are most important in terms of our national priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Tom Donohue recently 
wrote, ``After years of talking about failing infrastructure, we 
finally have the bipartisan buy-in, political will, and public support 
to do something about it. The President has pledged to act on this 
priority--and the public supports it. According to a new U.S. Chamber 
poll, fully 70 percent of Americans want the Federal Government to 
invest in infrastructure. By similar margins, the poll showed that 
Americans understand that infrastructure investment will grow the 
economy, help businesses, and create jobs.'' Our watershed project 
infrastructure should be a major part of this infrastructure 
investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">The Land Improvement Contractors of America (LICA) dates to 1951, 
and represents those earthmoving contractors that have installed many 
of the watershed dams and most of the conservation practices on our 
nation's landscape over time. They work closely with Soil &amp;amp; Water 
Conservation Districts and their motto is ``Dedicated to the 
Professional Conservation of Soil &amp;amp; Water.'' The focus of LICA is to 
encourage high standards of workmanship in resource management land 
improvement practices, and to promote private enterprise in land 
improvement contracting. Training and safety are key LICA activities. 
They have also worked very closely with NRCS over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">Let me close by sharing the LICA Creed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">The LICA Creed</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">Land, the Foundation of the Nation,</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">We often take it for granted, or even abuse it,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Peterson ">and yet many unthinking and unknowingly pass the land by.

    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF JOHN FINNEY, PRESIDENT, RED RIVER</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="JOHN FINNEY">Mr. Finney, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
  MANAGEMENT BOARD; CO-CHAIR, RED RIVER RETENTION AUTHORITY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="JOHN FINNEY">                          HUMBOLDT, MN
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Finney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Finney">Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and
Members of the Committee. My name is John Finney, and I serve 
as the President of the Red River Watershed Management Board of 
Minnesota and the co-Chairman of the Red River Retention 
Authority. I farm with my brother Dan near the Canadian border 
along the Red River up north where we experience frequent 
flooding and extended inundation of floodwater on our land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Finney">The Red River Retention Authority represents 22 Red River 
watersheds and water resource districts in North Dakota and 
Minnesota. The Retention Authority is a joint powers agreement 
between the Minnesota Red Board and the North Dakota Red River 
Joint Water Resources districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Finney">The mission of the Retention Authority is to implement the 
long-term flood solutions plan set forth by the Red River Basin 
Commission, and you have an attachment that would have that 
report in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Finney">Since the devastating flood of 1997, the Red River Board 
and the North Dakota Joint Board, the Retention Authority, 
along with several partners, have implemented projects that 
would provide over 185,000 acre-feet of flood storage upstream. 
While this is significant, it is only about \1/5\ of the basin 
goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Finney">These projects reduce flooding, improve water quality, and 
enhance wildlife habitat and recreation. An acceleration of 
these efforts has occurred with the initiation of 20 RCPP, 
Regional Conservation Partnership Program, watershed planning 
efforts throughout the Red River Basin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Finney">During the development of the 2014 Farm Bill, the Retention 
Authority worked with our Federal Congressional delegations in 
Minnesota and North Dakota to modify existing policies and add 
a cost-share funding component to implement retention projects. 
A few key enhancements were suggested to modify the USDA P.L. 
83-566 Program. These proposed modifications include 
eliminating the requirement under economic and environmental 
principles and guidelines for water resources and 
implementation studies from cost ratio calculations based on 
each individual project and instead allow flood control 
projects to be based an overall basin plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Finney">Since our original suggestions to modify the P.L. 83-566 
Program were not fully addressed, local watershed districts 
have encountered challenges with identifying and calculating 
the true and total benefits from implementing flood retention 
and flood damage reduction and environmental enhancements 
projects. Traditional benefit-cost analysis used by USDA for 
water resource projects makes the likelihood of future Federal 
funding to assist with retention project construction 
difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Finney">The priority of the Red River Board and the Retention 
Authority and its member districts is to demonstrate that the 
continued planning and implementation of these types of 
projects will enhance the infrastructure of rural America, 
improve water quality, and establish critical wildlife habitat 
for all basin residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Finney">I propose that the Federal cost-share for the planning and 
implementation of flood retention and flood damage reduction 
projects should be based on their economic, ecological, and 
social benefits provided to the entire Red River Basin, 
comparable to the justification of various USDA conservation 
programs. This approach would be a significant improvement to 
the formula for Federal funding assistance that encourages the 
public-private partnership for the Red River Basin watersheds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Finney">For rural America to compete with this program, there needs 
to be a modification of existing programs or new programs 
created that allow partnerships to thrive and encourage project 
implementation. These changes would assist in strengthening and 
achieving the partnership goals identified in the RCPP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Finney">The 2014 RCPP program was an excellent start to assist 
organizations like our Red River Board and the Retention 
Authority to reach their goals. The foundation has been laid to 
plan and build distributed retention projects to alleviate 
local watershed and basin flooding problems while incorporating 
environmental enhancements to improve water quality, wildlife 
habitat, water supply, and recreation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Finney">Collectively we must continue to assist one another in 
achieving a safe and economical, productive Red River of the 
North basin. Please consider implementing these proposed 
changes to provide for USDA funds to be utilized for watershed 
and water resource projects using a variable cost-share rate 
based on true and identified needs not only of the RCPP 
watersheds, but the entire Red River basin.</paragraph>

    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Finney follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony to you 
today. We sincerely appreciate your continued efforts in 
drafting the new farm bill.
  Prepared Statement of John Finney, President, Red River Management</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Board; Co-Chair, Red River Retention Authority, Humboldt, MN</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Finney ">John Finney, President, Red River Watershed Management Board 
(RRWMB), Minnesota and Co-Chair, Red River Retention Authority (RRRA), 
farmer and resident of the Red River Basin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the House Agriculture 
Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Finney ">My name is John Finney and I serve as the President of the RRWMB of 
Minnesota and as Co-Chair for the RRRA. I also farm with my brother, 
Dan Finney, near the Canadian border along the Red River of the North 
where we experience frequent flooding and extended inundation of 
floodwater on our farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Finney ">The RRRA represents 22 Red River of the North Basin watersheds and 
water resource districts in North Dakota and Minnesota. The RRRA is a 
partnership between the Minnesota RRWMB and the North Dakota RRJWRD. 
The genesis of the RRRA is to implement the Long Term Flood Solutions 
plan set forth by the Red River Basin Commission (see Attachment A). 
The RRRA's basin wide goal is a 20% reduction in peak flows on the Red 
River of the North main stem and to reduce local watershed flooding by 
distributed watershed storage of floodwaters in upstream floodwater 
retention projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Since the devastating flood of 1997, the RRWMB, RRJWRD and RRRA 
along with many Federal, state and local partners have implemented 
projects which have provided over 185,000 acre-feet of flood storage. 
While this is significant, it's only about \1/5\ of the basin goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Finney ">These projects reduce flooding to residents and properties, improve 
water quality, and enhance wildlife habitat and recreation. An 
acceleration of these efforts has occurred with the initiation of 20 
Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) watershed planning 
efforts throughout the Red River of the North Basin. The RRRA secured 
USDA RCPP funding in May of 2015. As a result, 20 small watershed plans 
in thirteen major watersheds in the Red River Basin are currently being 
developed throughout the basin (see Attachment B).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Finney ">In the development of the 2014 Farm Bill, the RRRA worked 
diligently with our Federal Congressional delegations in MN and ND to 
modify existing policies and add a cost-share funding component to the 
proposed farm bill to implement retention projects. A few key 
enhancements were suggested to modify the USDA Natural Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS) Small Watershed Protection program, or P.L. 
83-566 program. The ``P.L. 83-566 watershed'' program could be much 
more successful in the Red River basin if the suggested program 
modifications were made to address basin-wide resource issues in 
addition to the current local watershed resource issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Finney ">These proposed program modifications include; eliminate the 
requirement under economic and environmental principles and guidelines 
for water resources implementation studies for individual benefit to 
cost ratio calculations on each individual project and instead allow 
flood control projects to be based upon an overall basin plan (see 
Attachment C; pages 10 and 11: RRRA Consolidated Subcommittee reports 
dated March 28, 2011 for other specific recommendations).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Since our original suggestions to modify the P.L. 83-566 program 
were not fully addressed, local watershed districts working with their 
consultants in planning the 20 RCPP watersheds have encountered 
challenges with identifying and calculating the true and total benefits 
from implementing flood retention and flood damage reduction and 
environmental enhancement projects. Traditional benefit-cost analysis 
used by USDA for water resource projects makes the likelihood of future 
Federal funding to assist with retention project construction 
difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Finney ">A priority of the RRWMB, RRRA and its affiliated member watershed 
and water resource districts is to demonstrate that the continued 
planning and implementation of projects will enhance the infrastructure 
of rural America, improve water quality in lakes and streams, and 
establish critical wildlife habitats for all Red River basin residents. 
Determining the value of input costs of fertilizer or the revenue 
generated from hunting can be calculated, but valuing societal benefits 
of having adequate water quality and wildlife habitat is much more 
subjective and controversial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Finney ">I propose that Federal cost-share for the planning and 
implementation of flood retention and flood damage reduction projects 
should be based on their economic, ecological and social benefits 
provided to the entire Red River of the North basin from a programmatic 
perspective comparable to the justification of various USDA 
Conservation Programs. This approach would be a significant improvement 
to the formula for providing Federal assistance that encourages a 
``Public-Private-Partnership'' for the Red River of the North basin as 
well as small watersheds. For rural America to compete with this 
program, there needs to be modification of existing programs or new 
programs created that allow partnerships to thrive and encourage 
project implementation. These changes would assist in strengthening and 
achieving the partnership goals identified in the RCPP program.</paragraph>

Vision</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Finney ">A Red River Basin where residents, organizations, and governments 
work together to achieve basin-wide commitment to comprehensive 
integrated water stewardship and management.
Mission</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Finney ">To create a comprehensive integrated basin-wide vision, to build 
consensus and commitment to the vision, and to speak with a unified 
voice for the Red River Basin.
Red River Basin Commission's Long-Term Flood Solutions for the Red</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Finney ">River Basin</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Finney ">The Red River Basin is an international, multi-jurisdictional 
watershed of 45,000\2\ miles, with 80 percent of the basin lying in the 
United State[s] and 20 percent in Manitoba, Canada. Eighteen Minnesota 
counties and 22 North Dakota counties lie wholly or partially in the 
basin. The economic impact of the basin, from both urban-generated 
activity and a vibrant agricultural economy, is significant. This basin 
is home to more than half a million people, and serves as a jobs, 
education and medical hub, in addition to a world-renowned agricultural 
producer.
Need for Action</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Finney ">The increase in frequency and magnitude of flooding in the Red 
River basin is unmistakable. The spring flood of 1997 that decimated 
the metro center of Grand Forks-East Grand Forks and gravely threatened 
areas throughout the basin introduced a decade of flooding. Since 2000, 
the basin has experienced damaging flooding in all but 2 years. Since 
1997, most sites along the main stem have seen levels of flooding at or 
close to 100 year levels, some in more than one flood event. And 
tributary areas have experienced up to 500 year flood levels during the 
past decade. We know today that larger floods are both possible and 
probable.
The Impetus</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Before the major flood waters of 2009 had even receded, state 
legislators in North Dakota and Minnesota asked the Red River Basin 
Commission (RRBC), as an international basin-wide organization, to 
spearhead the effort to develop a comprehensive, proactive plan that 
responds to and mitigates flooding throughout the watershed. 
Corresponding with the legislative charge were appropriations of half a 
million dollars from each state to execute the project. The RRBC was 
uniquely positioned for this endeavor given its ongoing organized 
effort to further commitment to shared land and water stewardship goals 
in the basin, including the goal of flood damage reduction.
The Process</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Finney ">The LTFS study process brought together professional and citizen 
water managers from all levels and from all the reaches of the basin. 
In addition to hands on involvement from the RRBC Board of Directors, 
umbrella committees were assembled (Policy, Technical) and specific 
issue workgroups to dissect the issues and identify solutions. In 
addition, a number of outside experts and agencies were contracted to 
develop information and analysis for central questions addressed in the 
study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Most importantly, the study was a grass-roots effort. It was 
launched with an extensive public engagement process of 21 public flood 
forums held in the Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota portions of 
the basin, with more than 1,000 attendees in total.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Citizens' experiences, problems and concerns with flooding in the 
basin were solicited, together with suggestions for solutions. It was 
this public input that helped shape the study's committees and issues 
to explore. A second series of public meetings was held in spring of 
2011 in order to gather feedback from citizens on the primary 
directions and conclusions of the study. That feedback helped to guide 
final conclusions and recommendations. The results of the overall study 
findings are presented in this report to assist the basin's residents, 
community leaders, water managers and policy makers.

    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Assumptions for Future Conditions</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Pertinent to the LTFS plan development</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Finney ">adopted by RRBC Board 2010</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Components of the LTFS plan are intended to be developed and
 implemented over the next 50 years. It is important to understand the
 assumptions under which this plan was developed. The following describe
 basic assumptions about several issue areas in the Red River basin that
 are key to plan development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Agriculture will continue to be the dominant land use through out
 the basin. Adequate surface drainage has been and will continue to be
 integral to maintaining productivity of cropland. Subsurface drainage
 is likely to become increasingly popular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Current development trends will continue into the foreseeable
 future. The major urban centers and communities will continue in their
 present locations. Major metro areas will continue to grow. Future
 development will occur in compliance with floodplain management
 regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Floods will continue into the future. Floods larger than
 historically experienced can be expected to occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Flood damage reduction will need to be implemented in the basin
 based primarily on the identified needs of the basin residents and
 their willingness to provide or seek the funding necessary to implement
 the measures which they believe are appropriate, effective, and
 justified. State and Federal agencies will support the implementation
 of the various measures based on their policies, regulations and
 availability of funding. Flood damage reduction is just one issue that
 affects the sustainability of the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Other key resource issues need to be considered as this plan is
 developed and implemented, including droughts, water supply, water
 quality, recreation and other natural resource areas.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Guidelines for Protection in the Basin</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Before the LTFS study, the only site protection guideline for levels
 of protection was the Federal (FEMA) requirement that mortgaged
 structures in 100 year floodplains (or lower) carry flood insurance.
 The problem with these guidelines for the Red River basin is that 100
 year flood levels have been experienced on most reaches of the main
 stem and far surpassed in some tributary areas. RRBC developed baseline
 goals for levels of flood protection during the project.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level of Flood Protection Goals</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Finney ">The LTFS review of current local protection policies and practices 
revealed that the basin lacks adequate guidelines on levels of 
protection appropriate for various basin locations. The following goals 
for levels of protection were developed as part of the study and 
approved by the RRBC to serve as a guideline for the residents of the 
Red River basin, its communities, and state/provincial and Federal 
agencies, as they plan and implement future local protection projects 
(see Appendix D, Table D-3). The intended outcome of the goals is to 
provide a long-term objective for communities and sites that will 
cumulatively reduce the risk of flooding and flood damages from 
potential floods of larger size than the basin has experienced in the 
recent past. The goals can help move the basin beyond a mode reactive 
to the last large flood to a proactive mode of using risk and damage 
assessments to put adequate protection into place to reduce flood risk 
across the basin.</paragraph>

Notes:
\1\ Protection for urban areas, critical infrastructure, cities, rural
  residences, and farmsteads should all have appropriate freeboard
  (i.e., contingency or risk and uncertainty allowance) with any
  projects designed to provide the specified level of protection.
\2\ If a flood of record has occurred which exceeds the specified level
  of protection goal, the flood of record should be used in place of the
  specified level of protection goal.
\3\ The critical transportation systems should be maintained passable
  during a flood of the described level of protection to assure safe and
  reliable transportation and provision of emergency services. The
  transportation system should not increase flooding problems either
  upstream or downstream.
\4\ Includes Fargo-Moorhead, Grand Forks-East Grand Forks, and Winnipeg.</paragraph>

Current Levels of Protection Versus Needs in the Basin</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Although the strategy of local protection dates back many decades 
in the basin, the extent of existing site protection is still modest. 
The following table summarizes the levels of local site protection 
currently in place at basin communities and then compares that with 
RRBC's levels of protection goals to identify the gaps and the needs. 
The table reveals that flood protection for events exceeding the 100 
year level is an exception and that almost a third of the communities, 
on the average, have no permanent protection. Of those communities 
having permanent protection, fewer than half are protected to a 100 
year level or higher.</paragraph>

Results of Complimentary Floodplain Management Approaches</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Reducing flood risk in the Red River basin requires the working 
together of the three complimentary approaches of floodplain 
management: (1) nonstructural attention to the physical floodplain and 
land use practices, both urban and rural, together with participation 
in Federal programs such as NFIP; (2) local site protection for 
vulnerable damage sites such as communities, urban centers and, as 
possible, agricultural lands; and (3) reduction of peak flood flows 
through a basin-wide effort.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Finney ">The following figure summarizes the estimated damages prevented by
 the potential LTFS local protection projects, combined with a 20% flow
 reduction on the Red River main stem. Prevented damages are estimated
 for 100 year, 200 year and 500 year floods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Prevented damages are computed for both (1) baseline hydrology, or
 that currently used by the USACE and (2) wet period hydrology, or that
 recommended by the current USACE feasibility study for Fargo-Moorhead
 flood protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Depending on the hydrology used, damages prevented by the potential
 LTFS projects will range from about $3 to [$]4 billion for a single 100
 year flood, from $6.5 to [$]8 billion for a single 200 year flood, and
 from $10 to [$]13 billion for a single 500 year flood.</paragraph>

Total Prevented Damages of Potential LTFS Projects--Red River Basin
Part IV: Moving Ahead With Integrated Action
10 Conclusions and Recommendations for Action</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Finney ">The basin of the Red River of the North, historically subject to 
widespread chronic flooding, regularly sustains millions of dollars in 
economic damages for each flood event. The Red River Basin Commission 
(RRBC) identified the following conclusions on structural and 
nonstructural strategies needed for permanent flood solutions in the 
basin and recommendations for action for states (individually and 
collectively) and the Federal Government to consider as they fund and 
implement Long Term Flood Solutions (LTFS) for the Red River Basin in 
Minnesota and North Dakota. These recommendations are built around the 
basin-wide LTFS ``Level of Protection Goals'' adopted by the RRBC in 
2010 together with related flood risk reduction needs. The 
recommendations aim to move basin leaders from the usual response of 
reacting to the most recent major flood experience to a proactive, 
long-term plan with appropriate protection levels basin wide. If 
implemented, these recommendations will significantly reduce the risk 
of flood damages, and minimize disruption and economic loss and thus 
facilitate and expedite recovery after spring and summer floods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Finney ">These recommendations cannot be successful without the dedicated 
local, state and Federal participation in funding and commitment to 
implement.
1. Immediate Needs/Critical Risks: Fargo-Moorhead, Devils Lake
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Under current conditions, the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Finney ">area could get, in a major 500 year level flood, $9 to $10</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Finney ">billion or more in basin damages, according to the USACE.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Current levels of protection for Fargo-Moorhead are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Finney ">inadequate. Protection should be increased to enable a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Finney ">successful 500 year flood fight.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Protection measures for Fargo-Moorhead should be</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Finney ">economically viable and provide the least level of adverse</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Finney ">impacts to others.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; A diversion of the Red River around Fargo-Moorhead would</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Finney ">provide the protection needed to endure a successful 500 year</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Finney ">flood fight if it were supplemented by retention and other</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Finney ">available options to achieve the RRBC's proposed LTFS level of</paragraph>

  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Retention to achieve the potential 20 percent flow reduction</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Finney ">on the main stem should be aggressively pursued upstream of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Fargo-Moorhead to decrease the duration, scope, and level of</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Recommendation for Action 1.1</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Finney ">The flood protection trajectory that has increased protection in 
the Fargo-Moorhead metro area since the 2009 flood should continue. 
State and Federal funds, with local government cost share, should 
continue supporting ongoing dike construction, property acquisitions, 
flowage easements, and flood infrastructure projects to be able to 
fight at least a 100 year flood, and upwards of a 500 year flood in the 
long-term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Recommendation for Action 1.2</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Progress towards the proposed $1.77 billion diversion should be 
continued utilizing local, state, and Federal funds so that, combined 
with current flood protection strategies, this community will have the 
capacity within 10 years to wage a successful flood fight equal to or 
greater than the LTFS 500 year flood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Recommendation for Action 1.3</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Retention upstream of the Hickson and Abercrombie stream gage for a 
flow reduction of 20 percent (minimum) should be advanced with shared 
funding by the F-M flood Diversion Authority working with local and 
joint water boards, using city, local, state, and Federal funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Recommendation for Action 1.4</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Leaders in state government in North Dakota and Minnesota, along 
with key local government officials and with input from the Diversion 
Authority and Federal agencies, should convene by early 2012 to 
determine the non-Federal cost share formula for the Locally Preferred 
Plan ($1.77 billion) diversion, and related $3.5 million operational 
estimates.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Rising levels of water in the Devils Lake region have</paragraph>

Lake activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Finney ">Recommendation for Action 1.7</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Finney ">A comprehensive model using real-time data to determine the effects 
of releases of Devils Lake water via the various outlet channels on the 
Sheyenne and Red Rivers should be examined by local leaders and state 
and Federal agencies to determine needs and related costs. The 
examination should include the integration of various models already in

Notes:
\1\ The estimated amounts of the Federal and non-Federal Fargo/Moorhead LPP Diversion project total costs are based on the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan
  Area Flood Risk Management project Supplemental Draft Feasibility Report and Environmental Impact Statement, April 2011. Final cost-sharing amounts
  between the non-Federal partners have not yet been determined.
\2\ Additional local protection included as a part of the Fargo-Moorhead LPP North Dakota diversion project cost listed under Fargo and Moorhead at the
  top of this table.
\3\ Tolna Coulee cost includes $14 million for the control structure to prevent significant erosion in case of a natural overflow.
\4\ Cost-sharing for raising railroad embankment at Devils Lake estimated to be \1/3\ cost-shared by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, \1/3\ by
  Amtrak, and \1/3\ by the North Dakota Department of Transportation through a U.S. Department of Transportation grant.
\5\ Federal participation in potential upstream storage projects is assumed to be available through future U.S. farm bill at approximately 50 percent
  cost-sharing; however, actual Federal funding availability and cost-sharing amounts is uncertain. Also, implementation of projects in each state is
  assumed to be at comparable levels, however this will depend on project implementation schedules by each state.
\6\ Operation and maint[enance] (O&amp;amp;M) costs of projects are not included in this tabulation, even though in some cases the O&amp;amp;M costs may be substantial.
  O&amp;amp;M costs are typically a non-Federal or local responsibility and should also be considered in the implementation decision for a project.
\7\ Information on specific projects at individual communities can be found on the City Assessment tables in Appendix C.
\8\ Funding for farmstead and rural ring dikes depend on the number of landowners requesting assistance. A rough estimate based on funding from recent
  years is included.</paragraph>

    <speaker>The Chairman. Thank you, Mr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="875" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr">Finney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="876" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr">I now recognize myself for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="877" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr">Mr. Burns, you are exactly right about the droughts of the 
1950s. Granted, I was not around at the time, but the effect in 
the Southwest, Oklahoma and Texas, when it broke, starting in 
1957, 1958, and 1959, the deluge was just amazing, according to 
records and my parents' accounts. It did drive forth the 
process to accelerate this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="878" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr">First, let me turn to Mr. Emmons for a question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="879" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Mr">    You are not just a conservation activist. You are an all-
around conservation-focused farmer. Expand for a moment, Jimmy, 
about how all this intertwines together, good stewardship of 
the soil, of the water retention structures, making these 
investments, the environment, if you would for just a bit.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="880" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Yes. It is a very intricate partnership from
local producers, from there downstream. We have to worry about 
catching the first raindrop, get it in the soil. We have to 
worry about coming into the small watersheds, the release out 
of that, down through there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="881" speaker="Mr. Emmons">It is an intricate system of how we control the water when 
it comes. Where it is range management, Mr. Bramblett talked 
about cover crop systems above streams, all that helps with 
water quality as it moves down into the watersheds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="882" speaker="Mr. Emmons">    But we still have to have those watersheds there to catch 
the heavy rainfalls like we were just talking about and also 
releasing that slowly out of that 10 day interval there. And so 
it takes a lot of O&amp;amp;M, operation and management, inspections on 
the dams to make sure that they are very functional.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="882" speaker="Mr. Emmons">    The Chairman. And it is worth reinforcing the point that </paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="883" speaker="Mr. Emmons">    But we still have to have those watersheds there to catch 
the heavy rainfalls like we were just talking about and also 
releasing that slowly out of that 10 day interval there. And so 
it takes a lot of O&amp;amp;M, operation and management, inspections on

the protection is provided from that let down pipe all the way 
to the ocean.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="884" speaker="Mr. Emmons"> Oh, yes.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="884" speaker="Mr. Emmons">    The Chairman. It is not just on the farm or the neighbor </paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="885" speaker="Mr. Emmons"> Oh, yes.
down the road or the county road. It is all the way to the 
Atlantic if you live in Oklahoma, or it is all the way to the 
Pacific if you are on the west side of the Rocky Range.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="886" speaker="Mr. Emmons"> Yes. What happens on my farm affects clear
downstream to the ocean.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. Mr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="887" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"> Peterson, you have been involved in the
process a good long time, clearly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="888" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="888" speaker="Mr. Peterson">    The Chairman. And you have observed and been a big part of </paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="889" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> Yes, sir.
the progress that we have made. There is always more to do. 
Expand for a moment on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="890" speaker="Mr. Peterson">Well, as Mr. Bramblett told you, he told you
a little bit about the backlog and the things they are facing 
in NRCS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="891" speaker="Mr. Peterson">I happen to believe Public Law 83-566 in these watershed 
programs is one of the best tools ever invented that not only 
do conservation work on the land, but flood management, flood 
damage reduction work. And it is just unlimited how many 
benefits we can get in this country from installing watershed 
kinds of activities throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="892" speaker="Mr. Peterson">And as we mentioned, in Ranking Member Fudge's state, they 
are even doing a lot of land treatment projects now that don't 
have structures there, but we are addressing all those land 
treatment conservation measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="893" speaker="Mr. Peterson">    It is unlimited how much we could accomplish if we had the 
ability to do so. And that ability is somewhat limited not just 
by funding, but by the people available to do the work. But to 
me this is one of the best authorities we have ever had.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. Mr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="894" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"> Burns, in your community where the
programs have been successfully implemented, do the citizens 
understand and appreciate that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="895" speaker="Mr. Burns">Yes, sir. Yes, sir, they do. But, citizens
downstream probably are better served than the local citizens. 
Now it is 348 miles from my home to the Gulf of Mexico, and the 
downstream partners, and I call them partners because they are 
downstream of me, benefits greatly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="896" speaker="Mr. Burns">    The Tarrant Regional Water District is a partner of ours in 
the maintenance of our structures and land treatments, and that 
is incredibly beneficial to them. They say that a penny 
invested saves them a dollar. They get a hundred-fold on the 
investments they put in my county.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. Mr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="897" speaker="The Chairman. Mr">Emmons and I come from a community that
was the center of the abyss of the Great Depression and the 
drought of the 1930s. And this is a legacy issue, not just a 
current issue, but a legacy issue, for both of us, in that we 
had an activist by the name of Red Males, my family's banker 
from 1924 until 1989, who was a big proponent after the 1934 
flood in helping drive Members of Congress in Oklahoma in this 
direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="898" speaker="The Chairman. Mr">    It is important, right, Jimmy, that we continue to work on 
that great legacy laid down by our predecessors?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="899" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Oh, it is very important. I mean, that was an
unprecedented flood back then and lots of loss of life. And as 
I allude to, in my family farm, I mean, it sheared off the top 
soil as deep as granddad had plowed it, and that is hard, hard 
to replace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="900" speaker="Mr. Emmons">But it also affects water quality downstream. And that is 
what you really need to think about in legacy here is, like you 
said, all the partners from my farm downstream that were 
affected by what we do there on my farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="901" speaker="Mr. Emmons">    So, yes, it is very, very important that we continue that 
legacy to protect our citizens, protect our roadways, and 
protect our soil.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="901" speaker="Mr. Emmons">    The Chairman. And to share these accomplishments with the </paragraph>

protect our soil.

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="903" speaker="Mr. Emmons"> That is correct.

    <paragraph paraId="905" speaker="The Chairman. With that, my time has expired">    I turn to the Ranking Member for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Fudge</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="906" speaker="Ms. Fudge">Thank you all for your testimony today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="907" speaker="Ms. Fudge">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="908" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Fudge</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="909" speaker="Ms. Fudge">The Trump Administration budget does not request
any funding for the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program for 
Fiscal Year 2018 citing that maintenance, repair, and operation 
of these dams are the responsibility of local project sponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="910" speaker="Ms. Fudge">    Mr. Emmons, you mentioned farm sense in your testimony. 
Please speak to the importance of this federally assisted but 
locally planned and implemented program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="911" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Well, the farm sense part of it, it is very
important that we protect these assets. We are challenged in 
Oklahoma with reduced budgets too where we have a lot of 
conservation districts now that either are not staffed or have 
a part-time staff, and we are trying to share with other 
districts to get people out on the ground to physically inspect 
these dams and do regular maintenance on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="912" speaker="Mr. Emmons">So it is very challenging. But still, the farm sense side 
of it tells me that we must protect these investments and 
protect our people, our livestock, our communities, and our 
roads and infrastructure down through that. Without that, then 
we have nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="913" speaker="Mr. Emmons">And Mr. Burns talked about how the protection of these 
watersheds has greatly increased from washing out lots of 
different structures in 1950 to a very few. That tells us that 
the system is working, but that doesn't mean that we need to 
ignore the system, because we have to maintain it. Whether it 
is a house or a dam, it has to have regular maintenance, and it 
has to be updated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="914" speaker="Mr. Emmons">From the pipes that go through the structures that could 
deteriorate and crack, to the embankments to the spillways, all 
has to be maintained. And that takes people on the ground. And 
it is very challenging. A lot of these conservation districts 
have reduced budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="915" speaker="Mr. Emmons">    You talked about the Federal budget being reduced. That is 
a fact that we can't give up. We must stress the importance of 
that, how important it is to manage the investment. We would 
never in farming country put that kind of investment out and 
ignore it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Fudge</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="916" speaker="Ms. Fudge">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="917" speaker="Ms. Fudge">    Mr. Burns and Mr. Peterson, if you could just quickly say 
what you believe the effect on your communities and our nation 
would be if we do not continue to fund these programs.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="918" speaker="Mr. Burns"> Could I----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="919" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> Go ahead.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="920" speaker="Mr. Burns">I was very apprehensive coming up here. It made
me very nervous to do this. And I was thinking about it on the 
way up here, driving up the interstate, that this system is 
like an interstate. There is local investment, but I can't 
invest in an interstate highway all the way to D.C. with local 
tax dollars even though I need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="921" speaker="Mr. Burns">    If that makes sense to you, it gives you a little analogy 
about this. I can't afford the investment all the way to the 
Gulf of Mexico. But the benefits are there, and it is important 
to keep that up.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="922" speaker="Mr. Peterson">I would like to make a comment also, and I
appreciate that question. I am probably going to demonstrate to 
many in the room that I am not a good economist, although I 
have worked with them all my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="923" speaker="Mr. Peterson">    But the fact of the matter is, when I talked about 2,100 
watershed projects throughout the nation and the $2.3 billion 
of average annual benefit, if you are a strict economist, I 
have worked with many who would say: Well, those are all 
regional projects, that only the people in that region need to 
fund them and work with them, but when you add all of those up 
that have been constructed throughout the United States, think 
of the national benefit. And that is the way I look at it.

    <paragraph paraId="928" speaker="The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back">    Mr. Finney, after the discussion I had with Mr. Bramblett, 
you folks, the Retention Authority, did your people raise these 
issues with NRCS?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Finney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="929" speaker="Mr. Finney">Yes, sir, we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="930" speaker="Mr. Finney">    Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. And they told you that we had to 
change the law. Is that what they----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Finney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="931" speaker="Mr. Finney">Exactly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="932" speaker="Mr. Finney">    Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. They didn't have any flexibility 
on the cost-benefit without----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Finney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="933" speaker="Mr. Finney">Not really. The cost-benefit thing has been
kind of a problem to us in the basin specifically because we 
have a plan that is put forward that is a comprehensive plan of 
bringing together several of these projects to alleviate the 
total flooding on the main stem of the Red River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="934" speaker="Mr. Finney">And for those of you that are not familiar with the Red 
River, we are one of the very few that flows to the north. We 
thaw out from the south to the north. Our river ends up 
eventually in the Hudson's Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="935" speaker="Mr. Finney">That kind of tells you what kind of a problem we have. 
Downstream, 200 miles from us, the spring thaw occurs, and us 
poor schleps up on the Canadian border are sitting there froze 
up for the next 3 weeks. It gets to be kind of a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="936" speaker="Mr. Finney">That is what we are looking for, this comprehensive 
approach to water management, these upstream retention 
structures. And the cost-benefit, of course, is when you do 
each individual little area, we aren't able to meet the 
criteria established by the Federals. It doesn't mean that we 
are going to discontinue our efforts to move forward. We will 
try to use the P.L. 83-566 as best as we can. But we will 
continue moving forward with both local and state money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="937" speaker="Mr. Finney">    Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. I think it is fair to say that 
the 250,000 acre limitation is really out of date. It hasn't 
been changed since the program was created.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Finney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="938" speaker="Mr. Finney">In our mind it is, Mr. Peterson. The main
reason is we live in a very flat river valley, up from 12 miles 
to 250 miles wide, and there are only so many prime sites that 
we can use to store these kinds of projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="939" speaker="Mr. Finney">P.L. 83-566 limits us into the fact that, like I said, we 
have to pick off the plums. We want to use the best that we 
can. If we could get a little more capacity or if we could, 
make these kinds of things work, it would be better off for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="940" speaker="Mr. Finney">Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. And just for our Members, one of 
our big problems we have had is dealing with the Corps and 
trying to get permits and that bogged us down. But this fight 
goes back to the Corps not wanting us to be doing this. They 
want to run all of these projects. And that is part of the 
reason why we don't get an increase in the acreage size.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="941" speaker="Mr. Finney">But if you want to make sure that the project costs three 
or four times what it should, then put the Corps of Engineers 
in charge, and you will accomplish it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="942" speaker="Mr. Finney">I don't know what we do to simplify this system. But as I 
said earlier, we are wasting a lot of money because we could be 
doing stuff out there. And it is not just the Corps. We have 
had trouble with the local DNR not approving things. It is just 
one thing after another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="943" speaker="Mr. Finney">    But one of the things, I have this list here, so I don't 
know what you are doing in Oklahoma, Mr. Chairman, but 
according to this list, you have 987 P.L. 83-566 projects, and 
we only have 37 in Minnesota. Either you are doing really good, 
or we are doing really bad.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. Mr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="944" speaker="The Chairman. Mr">Chairman, if you lived through the Great
Depression and drought from the 1930s, you would do everything 
you could to hold the water and soil in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="945" speaker="The Chairman. Mr">    Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. I don't know if any of you folks 
that have been around this for a while, but can you explain to 
me why Iowa has 1,066, Missouri has 1,148, Oklahoma has 987, 
Texas, 697, and then these other states have 16 or 35? What is 
going on here? Why is that occurring?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="946" speaker="Mr. Burns">It is due to catastrophic weather events,
likely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="947" speaker="Mr. Burns">    Mr. Peterson of Minnesota. The what?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="948" speaker="Mr. Burns"> The likelihood of catastrophic weather events in
those locales. That is what I attribute it to.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="949" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> I think there is more to it than that,
though. It is local leadership that is part of it, because 
local leaders had to recognize the program could assist them, 
and they reached out and adopted it. Many states still haven't.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="950" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Yes. It is locally-led conservation, the
passionate from-the-heart people that puts it in place and 
tries to protect their soil and their water.</paragraph>

for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="957" speaker="Mr. Allen">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="958" speaker="Mr. Allen">And thanks to the panel for your comments and being here 
today to talk about these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="959" speaker="Mr. Allen">I represent the 12th District of Georgia, and I have heard 
it said many times by our state leaders, of course, we have 
water wars with other states. But Georgia does not have a water 
problem. We get 51" of annual rainfall a year. We have a water 
management problem in Georgia, which is the subject that we are 
talking about today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="960" speaker="Mr. Allen">But then we do have some dry times in Georgia. At least all 
of our corn is irrigated, or it better be. And, of course, they 
are sucking that water out of those caverns, and then that 
causes problems downstream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="961" speaker="Mr. Allen">Nobody wants to solve this issue more than our folks in 
Georgia and our neighboring states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="962" speaker="Mr. Allen">In the Corps, we have found that is an issue. But going 
back, you have the Federal Government and then you have all our 
state governments. And somehow there seems to be some problem 
working together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="963" speaker="Mr. Allen">Could you elaborate, anybody on the panel, as far as how in 
the world we could fix that and allow the Federal Government to 
do its role in conjunction with the state and local? As we 
said, this is a local problem, particularly the maintenance of 
these properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="964" speaker="Mr. Allen">    Mr. Emmons, could you elaborate on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="965" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Well, that is not an easy problem. You would
think that people could come together for the common good. We 
have seen that challenging in the past. We have been blessed 
that we had some Federal dollars for rehab in Oklahoma, thanks 
to Congressman Lucas, in the 2014 Farm Bill. The big challenge 
is state matching funds of that to get the dams in rehab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="966" speaker="Mr. Emmons">With state budgets shrinking, that becomes very, very hard. 
We were very blessed this year that we did get some increase in 
dollars for that rehab. It was a very hard-fought battle to get 
that money in a $900+ million deficit budget. It took a lot of 
people from our districts working at the state capital to get 
that done. And we think this is just the beginning. We think 
that will grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="967" speaker="Mr. Emmons">But it really comes back down to locally-led and getting 
the people that vote out to speak to the ones that are making 
the decisions and share our passion about how we go about 
protecting their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="968" speaker="Mr. Emmons">It was talked about earlier, when people build below these 
structures without even thinking. And then in 2015, we had a 
flood in a town south of me, Elk City. We were very fortunate 
that day to be able to fly with the National Watershed 
Coalition in a helicopter. And the significant flooding the day 
after that where these dams were flowing out the spillways, we 
had some issues there that those dams need to be rehabbed 
because they are past their life expectancy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="969" speaker="Mr. Emmons">To answer your question is we have to work with our 
legislators and get the people that vote, that care, to realize 
the importance of these structures and the land practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="970" speaker="Mr. Emmons">    It is not all about the structures. You talked about in 
Georgia, it is about managing the land above that, whether it 
be range management, like myself, I do a lot in cover crop 
practices. And it is very important that we manage that 
rainfall when it comes to infiltrate. I would love to have 50"+ 
in western Oklahoma.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="971" speaker="Mr. Allen"> Yes. Right. Yes. The Corps' answer to that flood
problem is they always lower our lakes in the wintertime. But 
that is very disturbing for our recreational users. I mean, 
what are your thoughts on that as far as management goes? Any 
other thoughts from the other members of the panel about what I 
brought up as far as working together?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="972" speaker="Mr. Peterson">Could I make a comment on the difference in
philosophy, maybe, between the Corps and NRCS? I respect the 
Corps quite a bit. They are marvelous technicians. They do what 
they feel like they are directed to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="973" speaker="Mr. Peterson">    But there is a book that I would recommend for your late-
night reading called, Big Dam Foolishness written by a 
gentleman named Elmer Peterson from Oklahoma. It talks about 
the difference in philosophies and how one program went one way 
and one went another. It is a marvelous book on the background 
and philosophies between the two agencies.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="974" speaker="Mr. Allen"> Okay. Good.
</paragraph>

moment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="976" speaker="Mr. Allen"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. There is an additional issue to consider</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="977" speaker="The Chairman. There is an additional issue to consider">The
actual structures, when they are on a farm, really doesn't add 
to the quality of life for the landowner. Only one in 30, 40, 
maybe 50 actually ever hold, in these typical structures, 
enough water to be called a fishing hole. Otherwise they are 
dry-weather ponds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="978" speaker="The Chairman. There is an additional issue to consider">You have this earthen structure. You have changed the lay 
of the land. The landowner is helping his or her neighbors 
downstream. They really don't gain that much from it. From 
them, it is a sense of being a part of the common good to start 
with, and then it cascades down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="979" speaker="The Chairman. There is an additional issue to consider">    These structures were never condemned. The properties were 
allowed to be constructed after easements were signed, 
permission given by landowners dating back to the 1940s.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="980" speaker="Mr. Allen"> We are talking about dry ponds here?
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="980" speaker="Mr. Allen">    The Chairman. That is basically most of the structures in </paragraph>

my core area.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="982" speaker="Mr. Allen"> When we have a flood in these dry ponds, then we
are washing out these dams?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. No</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="983" speaker="The Chairman. No">No. The upstream flood control dams are a
series of small dams. When you have a flood, each of the dams 
catches the water that comes from above it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="984" speaker="The Chairman. No">    As the Deputy Chief pointed out earlier, the 10 day goal is 
then to meter the water out. They act as a shock absorber. 
Instead of this deluge going down the creek and down the river 
and building, they slow it down, they meter it out so it is 
manageable within the existing stream banks, which protects 
wildlife, too, by the way, as well as domesticated livestock.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="985" speaker="Mr. Allen"> The subject we are talking about here today is
the Federal Government actually doing what it is supposed to be 
doing as far as that relief downstream.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="985" speaker="Mr. Allen">    The Chairman. How the system has worked is why we have this </paragraph>

match between local entities and the Federal Government, 
because the local entities can't pay for it. And typically it 
wouldn't benefit them, the protection given from 3 miles below 
the dam all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. But by the Federal 
Government participating, we set up these networks that protect 
everybody below the stream.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="987" speaker="Mr. Allen"> Okay.

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="989" speaker="Mr. Allen"> You all want to comment on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="990" speaker="Mr. Burns"> Eighty-five of my structures are usually between
1 acre and 5 acres. They do retain some water, and most of the 
time if does last all summer. Prior to 2015, we had another 6 
or 7 years of drought, and most of those were dry. The 
landowner nor any of the locals that like to fish there were 
benefiting at all.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Allen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="991" speaker="Mr. Allen"> Well, I hope we can get this figured out, and I
yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. Thank you</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="992" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="993" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">The chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona for 5 
minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="994" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">Mr. O'Halleran. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="995" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">I just want to say I have been working with conservation 
districts now for 20+ years, and it has been such a pleasure. 
And it is really good to have some folks here, and I want to 
compliment the Chairman on having folks who have real-life 
experience in this stuff, because it is hard to understand out 
there. And especially bringing in special interest people in 
here. No thanks. I like people from rural America that know 
what their land is all about. This Committee is one of those 
committees where we all share these types of common values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="996" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">But if we were going to look at rural America as we should, 
as our breadbasket, our natural resources, where they all come 
from, where our power plants are, how we are going to survive 
as a society, that is the bedrock, whether it is a rural 
America or Native American reservations, across that whole 
spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="997" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">But life is different out there from a tax standpoint. Life 
is different out there as far as being able to find cooperation 
and be able to build these types of structures without Federal 
help. And it is also different in maintaining them over time. 
And so that is why this partnership is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="998" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">And if we don't do that, it is actually a waste of the 
prior expenditures that we have put into it. And fiscally, that 
doesn't make much sense at all to me. And it is a legacy issue. 
We did build these. Whether there are 5,000 of them out there 
that have to have work on them, it is our responsibility to 
work with partners to get that done. And I am hoping as we go 
through the farm bill or through the budget process, that we 
are going to be able to get this issue away from the zero 
number into somewhere much more meaningful to get the work 
done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="999" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">But we also have to take into account the ongoing 
activities in the local area. What we are building downstream 
from these areas, what climate is or isn't doing to the 
process, and making sure that--I don't even know if the 
assessment of the dams right now takes into account the 
differences in climate from 20 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1000" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">But what happens if we don't do something? The impacts to 
rural America are tremendous, just tremendous. We have 
increased flood risk. We have a public health risk. I mean, 
health and safety, deaths, American citizens, loss of economic 
potential, increased FEMA floodplains, impact on family 
investments, the lack of maintenance of irrigation districts, 
irrigation into canals, the loss of water resources, water 
quality. You could go on and on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1001" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you">    So in these couple of minutes that are remaining, I would 
like to hear from you about how you feel about these types of 
losses and what you feel we can do about them to make sure we 
go in the right direction here.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1002" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Well, my work that I have done with land and
range management is, if you look at the Mississippi River flow 
since the very first monitoring that was done in the 
Mississippi, it was very consistent back before we plowed the 
prairie up. There were some ups, a little downs, but it was 
pretty flat. As the native prairie started being tilled up and 
put in production, we started seeing bigger swings. And the 
more we tilled, the worse that got, because it gets back to the 
point Mr. Bramblett brought up a while ago about organic matter 
in the soil. We can't capture the water in the soil as that 
organic matter was depleted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1003" speaker="Mr. Emmons">I think that it makes a lot of good sense that we start 
putting more land management practice with the cover crops and 
range management to get our organic built back up so that for 
every one percent we can catch 27,500 gallons of water per 
acre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1004" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Now, if you do the math, and I have done a presentation on 
this, in the Mississippi Delta flow region, if we would 
increase our infiltration rates at \1/2\", that is 83 days of 
the water that goes over Niagara Falls. Get it in the soil, 
keep it in the soil, and that will lessen the effect 
downstream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1005" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Mr. O'Halleran. I was just down in Galveston over the 
weekend at the commissioning of the USS Gabrielle Giffords. And 
I was looking at the beach. And the Congressman from Texas 
tells me, he says: ``Well, the water changes color down further 
south in Texas because up here we have all the sediment coming 
out of the Mississippi River, still down in Galveston. It is 
still changing color. And it gets blue and green further 
south.''</paragraph>

    <speaker>Mr. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1009" speaker="Mr. Kelly">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1010" speaker="Mr. Kelly">And thank you, witnesses, for being here. I apologize for 
walking out not hearing your testimony, but we have an Armed 
Services hearing that is going on simultaneously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1011" speaker="Mr. Kelly">    Mr. Peterson, our witnesses today have all successfully 
made the case for the economic benefits of flood control dams. 
However, the conservation value remains in how it protects and 
in some cases expands our resources. In addition to the 
traditional watershed programs, how has RCPP furthered the 
progress on watershed issues?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1012" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> I must admit, I am not the expert on RCPP. I
do know about the program, and my conservation district is not 
using it necessarily right now. But if any program or program 
dollars are able to put some watershed protection on the 
ground, I am certainly supportive of that. But maybe one of my 
colleagues up here has more experience with RCPP directly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1013" speaker="Mr. Kelly">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1014" speaker="Mr. Kelly">    And I would open that to any of you who have a comment.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1015" speaker="Mr. Burns"> My own local water control improvement district
and soil and water conservation district are basically all 
volunteers. It is very tough to get through that process 
without a grant writer. It is not that it is unavailable to us, 
but we have yet to take advantage of it because it adds a small 
amount of complication to the process that we haven't 
experienced in decades past. But it is still a good program, 
and it works well on a region-wide basis.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1016" speaker="Mr. Kelly">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1017" speaker="Mr. Kelly">And, Mr. Emmons, like you, the people of Mississippi 
understand the value of the stewardship of the land. And 
conservation programs and watershed infrastructure really are 
vital to many of my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1018" speaker="Mr. Kelly">    As someone who has engaged in some innovative practices 
over the year, what recommendations do you have for this 
Committee when addressing watershed-wide issues?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1019" speaker="Mr. Emmons"> Well, like I stated earlier, we have to put
some more practices on the ground above the structures to 
infiltrate that water, increase the organic matter. But it 
still comes down to the local people in the conservation 
districts there managing that resource that we put out there in 
those structures and ensuring that they work right. But it is 
still very important that we manage that land above them and 
below them so that we can slow that water. Ranking Member Fudge 
talked about the water quality downstream that will be greatly 
enhanced if we can do that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1020" speaker="Mr. Kelly">And I would just say that the watershed programs
do so much for the local communities, many of the people who 
don't even realize the value that it gets for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1021" speaker="Mr. Kelly">I thank all you gentlemen for what you have done in this 
program.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1025" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and for the
panelists for traveling here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1026" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Mr. Peterson, on the issue, I hear it from farmers and 
ranchers back home, with NRCS. And people are pretty happy 
overall, but the real frustration is with implementation of the 
projects. The actual folks who get out on the ground and do the 
engineering and the staff work needed out in the field is what 
I hear mostly about. That was mentioned early on in your 
testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1027" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">    Aside from budgets, what structural change do you think 
would be helpful to NRCS' program to stock it with the right 
people who can do more--well, I won't prejudice the question. 
What do you think needs to be done to move the projects along 
faster and have that be a stronger focus perhaps, please?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1028" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> Well, the answer to that is fairly easy as
far as I am concerned, and that is stop cutting professional 
staff in the agency. If you go back to the agency's highest 
employment time, it was probably in the 1970s with 18,000 
people. Now they are down around 10,500 people with far more 
program responsibilities than they used to have. And here we 
are trying to implement a lot of these programs that require 
competent professional staff. The agency, from the time I left 
it 25 years ago until today, has lost a great deal of the 
people that we need to manage these programs properly, and I 
would just like to see that stopped.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1029" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Okay, so no more cuts. But what is the ratio
of people that are able to actually implement the projects 
versus those that are----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1030" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> That question probably would have been better
asked of Mr. Bramblett when he was here, because he had all the 
current information on projects in the backlog.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1031" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Yes. We ran out of minutes on that, as it goes
up here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1032" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">    Anybody else on the panel wish to touch on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1033" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> I can touch on one fact, that the permitting
process is quite lengthy, even though there is a section 404 
process, and there are some practices that are put on the 
ground that require mitigation. And I believe----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1034" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Now, this is mitigation for doing things that
are positive environmentally.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1035" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> Exactly. And these projects should be
receiving the credits for the mitigation rather than having to 
give them, if that makes sense, because it is----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1036" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Do you feel it is outside of the law where
there are clear exemptions for a lot of agriculture, other 
activities that were pretty clear as Congress wrote them, and 
then they have been overtaken by interpretations that are----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1037" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> I believe you are correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1038" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> What do you think we should be doing about
that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peterson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1039" speaker="Mr. Peterson"> Streamline it in some way. But I am sorry, I
don't have the specific answers for you. But like I say, that 
permitting process for these small structures needs to be----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1040" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Kind of frustrating now, because it is
permitting the slowing down of things that are positive 
environmentally given that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1041" speaker="Mr. Burns"> Absolutely.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1042" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Win-win, isn't it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1043" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">    Anybody else on the panel.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1044" speaker="Mr. Emmons"> Yes. I mean, talking about your original
question and to that question, we see reduced staffing at NRCS. 
And they have several programs, the EQIP Program, CSP Program, 
all are very cumbersome. CSP has just come through another 
revised step, requires more time for the local NRCS.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1045" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Where did that step come from?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1046" speaker="Mr. Emmons"> Upstream. It came from here.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1047" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Yes. We are here to help, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1048" speaker="Mr. Emmons"> Yes. As these programs have become more
cumbersome and more time-consuming for that local conservation 
that is less time that he has to come out and help us with the 
structures for our land practices. Very good programs, very 
good programs, but very cumbersome. And with RCPP, that is 
another example, a very good program that, once you get it on 
the ground you can do great things, but it is very cumbersome 
to get it implemented.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1049" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Well, we need checks and balances so you don't
do rampant projects without proper review. But I guess we need 
help understanding here or attacking the core problem of when 
is too much permitting, where is the line between just enough 
permitting, just enough review, and this cumbersome business 
you are talking about here, because, yes, you want to have 
guidelines, but you also want the rubber to meet the road in 
getting projects done.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1050" speaker="Mr. Burns"> Probably some bracketing as far as acreage
covered or size of the structure and then possibly some 
exemption to a portion of that, if it meets some criteria.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1051" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1052" speaker="Mr. Emmons"> And you have to have some trust that the local
people that own the land have the greatest passion for the 
land. Don't make it so hard that we can't implement the 
practices.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1053" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> I am a little over time here, but do you find
that the folks on the ground at NRCS know what to do, but they 
are getting again their regional office or D.C. a signal that 
frustrates them? Is that pretty common?

    <paragraph paraId="1059" speaker="The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired">    The chair now turns to a fellow Subcommittee Chairman on 
the House Agriculture Committee, the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1060" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1061" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Thank you to all the members of the panel for being here, 
bringing your experience and expertise on important issues of 
small watersheds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1062" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    I have a question I just want to throw out in general to 
all four of you, if you would feel inclined to respond. 
Basically, infrastructure and job creation typically go hand in 
hand. Has that been the case with what we have been able to 
stimulate or facilitate with Public Law 83-566?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Emmons</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1063" speaker="Mr. Emmons">Yes, I would start with that. We are in Dewey
County on our fourth rehabilitation project. There are three of 
those dams within eyesight of my house. Yes, we saw that the 
amount of dollars that turns over in the local community is 
very significant. We have contractors come in, they had 
lodging, they buy fuel, they buy food. Plus, all the technical 
staff that puts that project together prior to construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1064" speaker="Mr. Emmons">And then afterwards, before the district takes back over, 
NRCS does some more on-the-ground assessments to make sure 
everything is just right before the district takes back over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1065" speaker="Mr. Emmons">    We have seen a great number of dollars influx into the 
local communities when we are doing them rehab projects.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1066" speaker="Mr. Thompson"> Very good. Any other of the gentlemen have
experience with that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1067" speaker="Mr. Burns"> We see the same benefits. Some local contractors
get bids on these projects when there are rehabilitation 
projects or other projects that are emergency watershed 
protection where there is some lake by it or some kind of 
damage to the dam that is contracted out. And we also use some 
local resources for gabion stone and things like that that 
support other businesses. There is a good trickle down for that 
that are utilized in the communities.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burns</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1068" speaker="Mr. Burns"> I am sure the NRCS today can tell you about how
many jobs are created with these construction projects that 
they have. I know in my day we could do that. We made some 
estimates of that. But I can tell you that there is job 
creation as a result of this construction.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1069" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Very good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1070" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    Mr. Finney, RCPP was one of the largest changes in the 
conservation title in the last farm bill. It was designed to 
address conservation concerns on a landscape level. Now that it 
has been fully implemented, how has it worked in conjunction 
with Public Law 83-566 and the rehab program?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Finney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1071" speaker="Mr. Finney"> I can't exactly speak to the rehab program. But
the planning that we are doing with the P.L. 83-566, the RCPP 
has allowed development of conservation practices upstream of 
our proposed projects as well as protecting the local drainage 
systems. We have been able to implement these kinds of 
practices to avoid soil erosion as well wind erosion and also 
protect the waters coming down from upstream to downstream into 
our retention projects.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1072" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Very good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1073" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

    <paragraph paraId="1075" speaker="The Chairman. The gentlemen yields back">Before we adjourn, the chair would like to thank the second 
panel for your insights and real-world experiences. Just as in 
our first panel, it has been very insightful in every way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1076" speaker="The Chairman. The gentlemen yields back">    And with that, I would turn to the Ranking Member to make 
any closing comments that she would make.

    <paragraph paraId="1108" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">The following plan is provided by the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS) in response to this request.
Introduction</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1109" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">The watershed program established through the Watershed Protection 
and Flood Prevention Act of 1954, as amended (Public Law 83-566) 
(watershed program) authorizes the Natural Resources Conservation 
Service (NRCS) to work with local sponsors to install watershed 
protection and improvement projects (see Appendix C for P.L. 83-566 
language). These projects create and protect vital infrastructure while 
conserving and protecting natural resources and contributing to local 
economies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1110" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">The watershed program was designed to address the critical 
challenges facing rural water resource protection and management. The 
watershed program initially focused on the design and construction of 
structural water control measures. Projects starting in the late 1970s 
focused on watershed plans and a greater emphasis on land treatment 
measures. Watershed planning also provides a basis for partnering at 
state and local levels to identify and co-invest in projects reflecting 
the highest priority needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1111" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Watershed scale approaches are foundational to progress toward 
today's challenges such as reducing nitrogen and phosphorus transport 
to Lake Erie, Gulf of Mexico, and the Chesapeake Bay. Other water 
management challenges that will be best addressed at the watershed 
scale include agricultural irrigation efficiency in California's 
Central Valley and in the Colorado River Basin; water management 
improvements to protect and restore environmentally and economically 
significant fisheries in the Pacific Northwest; acid mine drainage 
remediation needs in Appalachia and the Intermountain West; and flood 
protection for infrastructure and communities in the Central Plains and 
Northeastern States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1112" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">These and other benefits are well-founded in scientific research. 
For example, thirteen watershed scale projects summarized by Osmond, et 
al. (2012) not only demonstrated the effectiveness of watershed scale 
planning for improving water quality; but those studies also provided 
identification of critical source areas of nutrients and sediment 
(Meals, et al., 2012b); important socioeconomic drivers for enhancing 
conservation adoption at a watershed scale; best measures for 
quantifying outcomes; and numerous other parameters for successful 
watershed scale planning and implementation (Meals, et al., 2012a).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1113" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">This multi-year plan describes near-term needs including the 
existing approved project backlog, remediation of existing structures, 
and emerging needs, along with a process for guiding future investments 
to improve watershed condition. The watershed program can provide a 
valuable tool for agriculture and rural communities across the nation 
to address serious water management threats from extreme drought to 
unprecedented flooding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1114" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">The vision is a Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1115" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Program delivered in partnership with local sponsors to protect</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1116" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">and enhance agriculture and the environment through measures</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1117" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">that provide landscape resilience, flood prevention, and water</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1118" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">quantity and quality benefits for individuals and communities.
Background</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1119" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Over the past 6 decades the nation has invested $6.2 billion 
(nominal dollars) through the watershed program to install over 2,000 
projects across the country (Fig. 1) to create and protect vital 
infrastructure while conserving and protecting natural resources and 
contributing to local economies (see Appendix B for a table of 
historical appropriations). The objectives of many of the original 
projects were to reduce flooding, improve drainage, and increase 
irrigation efficiencies. In the 1960s, high priority was placed on 
projects that provided jobs to combat poverty and encourage rural 
development; many of these projects involved establishing recreation 
areas. In later years projects focused on land treatment measures to 
solve natural resource problems, such as substandard water quality and 
loss of wildlife habitat.
Figure 1: Watershed Projects Funded, 1947-2010
Watershed Operation Projects--Number of Projects Funded</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1120" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">These watershed projects continue to deliver benefits that are 
increasingly important as population and food security demands rise, 
and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events increase 
(Cai, et al., 2014). By avoiding and reducing flood damages, NRCS 
estimates that this program annually provides over $352 million in 
benefits to agriculture and over $462 million in benefits to non-
agricultural uses, such as roads, bridges, and homes. Other benefits 
such as erosion control, water conservation, water quality improvement 
and irrigation efficiency exceed $441 million on agricultural lands and 
over $957 million from recreation, fish and wildlife, rural water 
supply and municipal and industrial water supply, annually. In total, 
as a result of installed watershed projects made possible through the 
investment from NRCS and local sponsors, the watershed program provides 
an estimated $2.2 billion in average annual benefits across the nation 
(Fig. 2).
Figure 2. Watershed Program Benefits--Average Annual Monetary Benefits</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1121" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">(2014 Dollars)
Watershed Operation Projects--Average Annual Benefits</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1122" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Another way to view these benefits is by the number of people and 
communities who benefit directly from watershed projects. The existing 
projects are protecting over 610,000 homes, 46,000 businesses, 180,000 
farms and ranches, 61,000 bridges, and 28,000 domestic water supplies 
(Fig. 3). As a result, over 48 million people across the United States 
benefit from the watershed program every year.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1123" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">\1\ Benefit estimates presented here are drawn from the benefit 
cost analyses that are completed for each watershed project prior to 
implementation, and which monetize the estimated annual benefits for 
the project. Projects must have a greater than 1:1 benefit-cost ratio 
for approval. The estimates presented here have been adjusted for 
inflation and are considered conservative.

A Federal-State-Local Partnership</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1124" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">At the core of the watershed program is a unique Federal-state-
local partnership with project sponsors. Local sponsors identify needs, 
provide funding, and commit to operating and maintaining the completed 
projects over the long-term. The amount of funding and related 
arrangements depends on the type of project being implemented. 
Historically, local sponsors have provided an average of 60 percent of 
the total project funding. The non-Federal contributions include local 
and state in-kind contributions and funding for construction, permits, 
easement acquisition, and operations and maintenance for the project 
life. Working in cooperation with local sponsoring organizations, NRCS 
prepares detailed watershed plans that outline soil and water 
management resource concerns and alternatives to address them, 
including estimated benefits and costs, cost-share funding and 
arrangements, and operation and maintenance arrangements. Projects are 
locally driven, addressing critical needs for the community and 
delivering multiple streams of benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1125" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Secretary Ezra Taft Benson wrote in the 1955 [Y]earbook of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1126" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Agriculture, ``The new watershed protection program (P.L. 83-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1127" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">566) clearly should not be looked upon as some miracle coming</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1128" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">out of the Federal treasury. If it is successful, it will be</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1129" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">because local people working through their organizations with</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1130" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">the help of their state government assume and maintain</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1131" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">principle initiative.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1132" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">The watershed program provides the authority to carry out 
Cooperative River Basin Studies and Watershed Surveys and Planning 
Program activities. The Cooperative River Basin Studies authorities 
include cooperative river basin studies, floodplain management studies, 
flood insurance studies, and interagency coordination and program 
formulation. These combine the efforts of Federal, state, and local 
agencies to establish a basis for the development of coordinated water 
resource programs. Investigation and survey reports serve as guides for 
the development of water, land, and related resources in agricultural, 
rural, and urban areas within upstream watershed settings. They also 
serve as a basis for coordination with major river systems and other 
phases of water resource management and development. Watershed Surveys 
and Planning allows NRCS and local partners to plan actions to address 
identified resource concerns within a watershed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1133" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">NRCS provides Federal financial assistance to project sponsors for 
the installation costs of land treatment measures to achieve 
environmental and public benefits such as surface and groundwater 
quality improvement, water conservation, and flood mitigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1134" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">As of December 2014, the Federal Principles, Requirements, and 
Guidelines (PR&amp;amp;G) superseded the Economic and Environmental Principles 
and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation 
Studies (P&amp;amp;G) to guide the formulation and evaluation of all water 
resources projects. The PR&amp;amp;G are intended to ensure proper and 
consistent planning by Federal agencies in the formulation and 
evaluation of water and related land resources implementation studies. 
Benefits and costs are estimated using the best current techniques and 
are calculated accurately, consistently, and in compliance with other 
economic evaluation requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1135" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Prior to implementation of the project, the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) requires NRCS to analyze the environmental impacts of 
such actions and make the analysis available to the public before 
decisions are made and actions are taken unless the action is 
categorically excluded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1136" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) or Environmental Assessments 
(EA) address ecological conditions such as water and air quality, 
watershed or ecosystem health, species diversity and richness. In 
addition, aspects for the economic and social, historical and cultural, 
political, and many other factors that may influence major changes in 
land use or management of the soil, water, air, plant, or animal 
resources are considered. Impacts of the future population centers and 
transportation infrastructure are also included.
Authorized Purposes</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1137" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">The authorized purposes for watershed projects are wide-ranging, 
and mutually supportive:

Stakeholder Input</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1174" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">In preparing this multi-year plan, NRCS reached out to stakeholders 
on priority needs and recommendations for program implementation. 
Several national organizations provided comments, which are summarized 
below.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1175" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Focus investments on agricultural water supply and resilience to 
climate change. Commenters encouraged USDA-NRCS to specifically 
recognize the threats to agriculture from climate change, specifically 
the anticipated impacts on water supply for agriculture and the related 
impacts on food supply, prices, and producer financial risk. Commenters 
recommended that the priority for watershed program investments be on 
agricultural water supply and resilience to climate change impacts. 
Future investment decisions should be guided toward agricultural 
viability, resilience, and reducing vulnerability. Commenters 
recognized that this approach may drive a focus toward new projects as 
a result of emerging vulnerabilities from climate-induced stresses to 
water supply and management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1176" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Include forest restoration on private lands to protect water 
supplies as a priority. Commenters encouraged USDA-NRCS to recognize 
the significant threat to water supplies that is posed by loss of 
forested lands. The commenters noted that an estimated 53 percent of 
water supply in the contiguous 48 states originates on forestland and 
that western forests are particularly at risk, many of which are 
privately owned and play a significant role in water supply and water 
quality. Restoration of forests on private land to improve their 
resilience helps to reduce wildfire risks for private and adjacent 
public forestlands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1177" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Align investments with other agencies where possible to maximize 
impact. One commenter recommended that USDA-NRCS provide priority for 
projects that complement or align with work being conducted by other 
agencies (e.g., U.S. Forest Service) to amplify benefits. For example 
prioritizing projects that would restore private forestland where 
Federal land management agencies are conducting similar activities on 
adjacent public lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1178" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Establish a continuing review and ranking of watershed projects. 
Recognizing that a significant backlog exists in previously authorized 
watershed projects and that some may no longer be of local interest, 
commenters recommended that USDA-NRCS assess all previously authorized 
yet uncompleted projects. It was recommended that the resulting list of 
projects should be prioritized in conjunction with partners, and the 
priority setting process include a ``readiness criteria test'' for 
implementation. In addition, commenters recommended that projects in 
queue be reviewed and re-ranked annually to allow the program to be 
responsive to changing conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1179" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Advocate for legislative changes to streamline implementation. 
Commenters noted that circumstances have changed significantly since 
the watershed program was authorized (1954) and opportunity exists to 
streamline and improve operations. These recommendations for 
legislative changes, outside the scope of this plan, focused on: 
broadening and balancing program purposes and eligibility; removing 
structure size limitations; improving data and benefits information; 
harmonizing program with similar authorities in other agencies; 
addressing cost-share rates; eliminating unused authorities and lower 
priority purposes; and improving clarity and intent.
Agency Assessment of National Needs</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1180" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">In addition to invited comments, NRCS also evaluated specific 
watershed protection and flood prevention project needs and associated 
costs as part of this plan development. This included a review of the 
existing authorized but unfunded projects, existing projects needing 
remediation, and potential new projects. Through this process, 220 
projects were identified; addressing a variety of purposes from flood 
prevention and watershed protection to agricultural water management 
and municipal and industrial water supply. The total cost of these 
projects was estimated at nearly $1.4 billion from FY 2016 through 2020 
(Fig. 9), which includes the share that would be contributed by the 
state or local partners, generally about 25 percent of total costs. 
Appendix A provides greater detail on project locations, purposes, and 
estimated costs.
Figure 9. Estimated Funding Need for Watershed Projects, by State,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1181" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">2016-2020
(Over $1.4 billion in funding needed)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1182" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Estimated funding needs to complete projects vary by fiscal year 
reflecting differences in the project status, length of time to 
complete, and complexity of the project. Figure 10 shows the level of 
estimated funding and number of active projects by fiscal year. The 220 
identified projects cover more than one fiscal year; the project 
numbers presented in the figure below reflect projects that would be 
underway at that time and are not additive across fiscal years.
Figure 10. Estimated Funding Need and Active Projects, by Fiscal Year</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1183" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">The majority (\2/3\) of projects focus on one of four single 
purposes--Flood Prevention, Agricultural Water Management, Land 
Treatment, or Water Quality (Fig. 11). Flood Prevention accounted for 
over 80 percent of these single-purpose projects and was identified as 
a shared purpose in another 19 percent of projects, making it the most 
common objective of the identified needs.
Figure 11. Estimated Funding Need by Number of Project Purposes</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1184" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Projects were also identified in terms of the type of activity to 
be conducted. Most project needs focused on completing construction of 
previously planned and designed components. Less than five percent of 
identified funding is for remediation needs--existing projects where 
measures are needed to correct oversights in structural designs or 
construction. Table 1 shows the number of projects and estimated 
funding by the stage of the project.

Process for Prioritizing Watershed Project Proposals</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1193" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">The Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO) Program 
provides technical and financial assistance to states, local 
governments and Tribes (project sponsors) to plan and implement 
authorized watershed project plans for the purpose of:
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; watershed protection.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; flood mitigation.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; water quality improvements.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; soil erosion reduction.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; rural, municipal and industrial water supply.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; irrigation.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; water management.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; sediment control.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; fish and wildlife enhancement.
  &amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; hydropower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1194" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">In order to be approved, projects must (1) be publicly sponsored, 
(2) be 250,000 acres or less, and (3) have at least 20 percent of 
benefits related to agriculture, including rural communities. In 
addition and in accordance with statute, projects that will exceed $5 
million in Federal contributions or with single structures holding more 
than 2,500 acre-feet require Congressional approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1195" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Sponsor capacity is an essential project element; sponsors must 
demonstrate capacity to implement, operate, and maintain the project, 
including possessing the necessary authorities; funding; acquisition of 
easements or other rights needed; and demonstrated capability to 
operate and maintain the project upon completion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1196" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Pursuant to Congressional guidance, the agency process for 
prioritizing watershed projects must consider (1) the agency's mission, 
(2) existing investment in watershed projects, and (3) future needs for 
improving watershed condition and mitigating the potential for 
watershed impairments.
Agency Mission</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1197" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">NRCS' Mission Statement is ``Helping People Help the Land,'' which 
highlights the agency's role in developing and delivering high quality 
products and services that enable people to be good stewards of the 
nation's soil, water, and related natural resources on non-Federal 
lands. The vision is a landscape where working farms, forests, and 
ranches are in balance with a healthy environment. This mission 
statement aligns seamlessly with the purposes of the watershed program 
and the agency's emphasis on assisting agricultural producers and 
communities address the dual challenges of adapting to and mitigating 
the effects of climate change.
Existing Investment</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1198" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">To guide investment in existing watershed projects, NRCS will focus 
on those projects where remediation is required. These are projects 
where the engineering design or related aspects of implementation are 
not operating as intended, as evaluated and verified through 
inspection. An estimated 49 projects in eight states are in need of 
remediation at an estimated $55 million, or four percent of total needs 
for the period 2016-2020. Based on funding availability, NRCS will 
allocate an appropriate level to address remediation needs on an annual 
basis.
Future Needs</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1199" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">To guide investment in future needs for improving watershed 
condition and mitigating potential for watershed impairments, NRCS is 
establishing a process based on state and national priorities. The 
process will include an annual announcement program funding (APF) that 
will outline the specific state and national priorities to be 
emphasized in the funding year. This allows the agency to focus funding 
effectively, while providing flexibility over time to accommodate 
emerging watershed protection priorities. NRCS will evaluate and rank 
potential projects for funding annually based on alignment with program 
priorities established at the state and national levels to be locally 
responsive, and nationally consistent:
  1.  State priorities--State Conservationists identify state watershed</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1200" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">project priorities with advice from the State Technical</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1201" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Committee. Priorities will consider current conditions and</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1222" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">This annual process and the associated ranking factors will result 
in prioritizing projects that will address a locally important, 
pressing natural resource issue in a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1223" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Sponsors would be expected to respond to the APF for any project 
proposed for funding, including those needs outlined in this report and 
detailed in Appendix A. This proactive process ensures that funding 
will be directed to those projects best positioned for immediate 
implementation.
Summary</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1224" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">Many challenges that face our nation's food security, water 
quality, water supplies, wildlife habitat, rural economies, and 
communities are most cost-effectively and efficiently addressed at a 
watershed scale. The USDA-NRCS watershed program is authorized to 
address these and related challenges. Historic droughts, floods, and 
other extreme weather events in recent years have demonstrated the 
value of previous investments in this program--nearly $2.2 billion in 
benefits each year accrue as a result of these investments. Today, the 
watershed program offers the opportunity to address pressing water 
management issues facing agriculture and communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1225" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member">In preparing this multi-year plan NRCS conducted an assessment of 
current needs. Through that process nearly $1.4 billion in estimated 
funding needs for 2016-2020 were identified. In addition, NRCS sought 
input from stakeholders on priorities for the program, going forward. 
Recommendations were used to help shape a priority setting process that 
accommodates local needs and national priorities. NRCS will use the 
prioritization process outlined in this plan to focus funding on the 
highest priority projects for improving watershed condition and 
building landscape resilience and preserving, protecting, and improving 
the nation's land and water resources and quality of the environment.
