    <speaker>Chairman Guthrie</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">We will bring the committee to order. A
quorum being present, the Subcommittee on Higher Education and 
Workforce Development will come to order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">Good morning and welcome to today's subcommittee hearing. I 
would like to thank our panel of witnesses and our members for 
joining today's important discussion on apprenticeships, an 
opportunity for us to grow our Nation's workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">I would especially like to welcome Ms. Stacey Hughes, a 
constituent of mine who lives not even a mile away, who serves 
as the State chair of the Kentucky Federation for Advanced 
Manufacturing Education, or Kentucky FAME; and Mr. Robert, or 
Robbie Peglow, a student, a Kentucky student, participating in 
Kentucky FAME. I look forward to hearing from you about how 
Kentucky is working to have young people get the skills they 
need to obtain good-paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">Every day, hardworking Americans search for a good-paying 
job that will lead them to a successful career. Many Americans 
find a pathway to a good-paying job through apprenticeship 
programs that provide real earn-and-learn opportunities that 
often turn into careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">For workers, apprenticeships are a chance to prepare for 
today's high-skilled, in-demand jobs alongside long-time 
industry professionals. In fact, based on the National 
Household Education Survey, an estimated 2.1 million Americans 
participated in apprenticeships last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">Employers also see apprenticeships as an outlet to invest 
in work-based learning programs that attract and help to retain 
highly qualified employees. And many have seen the results in 
the form of increased productivity and greater innovation. Our 
hearing today will explore how apprenticeship-style programs 
promote workforce development while also looking at Federal 
programs that are in need of improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">One aspect of apprenticeships where this committee sees 
room for improvement in order to help workers and employers is 
registered apprenticeships. Currently, registered 
apprenticeships are programs officially registered with the 
Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeship or State office 
of apprenticeships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">The Department of Labor has issued regulations requiring 
that registered apprenticeships meet 26 specific requirements 
relating to program design. DOL regulations also require that 
these programs adhere to equal employment opportunity 
regulations that are specific to apprenticeships. While the 
Department continues to regulate the registered apprenticeship 
program, workers and businesses are not convinced this program 
is something that is best for workforce development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">In 2016, only 206,000 individuals nationwide became 
apprentices through the Registered Apprenticeship Program. 
Further, less than half of the earn-and-learn programs choose 
to register their programs with the Department of Labor. The 
Registered Apprenticeship Program is yet another one-size-fits-
all approach that works better for Washington than it does for 
businesses and students who wish to use apprenticeships as a 
way to grow our workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">Rather than doubling down on the failed attempts of 
previous administrations to expand the registered 
apprenticeship program, this committee is looking for a better 
way to build on the successful efforts businesses have found to 
grow their own apprenticeship programs outside of the 
registered apprenticeship program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">It should be noted that any effort to promote 
apprenticeship opportunities needs to provide employees and job 
creators with the flexibility to innovative and develop high-
quality earn-and-learn programs without the burdens of 
Washington overreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">This has been the approach of the committee in our many 
efforts to strengthen workforce development this Congress and 
will continue to be our approach for the future. Today's 
hearing is part of the House Committee on Education and the 
Workforce's ongoing efforts to strengthen our workforce for the 
future, and it is even more important in the realm of 
apprenticeships now that the White House has taken note of the 
true success apprenticeship programs are having for workers and 
employers alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on how 
they have been able to create their own innovative 
apprenticeship programs and how we can strengthen these efforts 
to help close the skills gap that exists in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">I now yield to the subcommittee's ranking member, Susan 
Davis, for her opening remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">[The statement of Chairman Guthrie follows:]

programs without the burdens of Washington overreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">This has been the approach of the committee in our many efforts to 
strengthen workforce development this Congress, and it will continue to 
be our approach for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">Today's hearing is part of the House Committee on Education and the 
Workforce's ongoing efforts to strengthen our workforce for the future, 
and it is even more important in the realm of apprenticeships now that 
the White House has taken note of the true success apprenticeship 
programs are having for workers and employers alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on how they have 
been able to create their own innovative apprenticeship programs, and 
how we can strengthen these efforts to help close the skills gap that 
exists in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">______</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">Mrs. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am very pleased 
that we are here today to discuss successful earn-and-learn 
programs. As this committee looks to help build a highly 
skilled workforce and close the skills gap that we so often 
hear about, we must look at effective models to expand. We know 
that these models are not new, and in fact, apprenticeships 
have been training students for quality high-paying jobs for 
decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">Programs like The Apprentice School, which we will hear 
from today, integrate on-the-job training with related 
classroom instruction, and they also work with local community 
colleges to build and develop curriculum that allows 
apprenticeships to have stackable, transferable credentials and 
allows them to transition into other higher education pathways. 
These programs also work to educate teachers, families, and 
young people about the benefits of registered apprenticeships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">I am interested in hearing how we can build on the 
successes of these programs to make registered apprenticeships, 
apprenticeships more exciting for young people. We often hear 
from students that they are looking for more flexible education 
options to meet their busy schedules, and we need to answer 
this call and make quality apprenticeships a viable option for 
all students. Apprenticeships must be prestigious enough to 
attract students who seek the most challenging and aspirational 
programs. Parents want to know that their children are 
receiving a quality education that will yield a widely 
recognized credential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">As we will hear today, apprenticeships are not the only 
successful earn-and-learn model. However, if taxpayers are 
going to invest in these important programs, there must be 
accountability for students and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">I look forward to working with my colleagues on this 
committee to expand upon the registration process for 
apprenticeships while ensuring that protections remain in place 
for students. We will want to make sure that we don't just 
dismantle programs. What we need to be doing is be sure that 
the protections are there, because, otherwise, I think we 
really do a disservice to our students and what their 
expectations are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">I also believe that we can make apprenticeships more 
appealing by expanding them beyond the traditional trades. We 
would like to see companies build upon the phenomenal work that 
the building trades have done to open up apprenticeships in new 
industries. Just this year, Amazon announced it was starting a 
registered apprenticeship program for veterans in its IT cloud 
computing space. And Microsoft has recently announced one as 
well. This, I believe, is a key to how we expand 
apprenticeships in the U.S. It has to work for those 
businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">By recognizing and rewarding companies who develop 
successful programs, we can incentivize more industries to 
expand apprenticeships across the country. And we know that we 
have to engage with all of our partners in this effort, whether 
it is learning from the important work that unions have done in 
this space, asking businesses to continue engaging with the 
Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeships, or looking to 
schools and nonprofit organizations to develop meaningful 
curriculum for apprentices. We know that this must be a 
collaborative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Chairman Guthrie">Last week, in a disappointing maneuver, the Labor, Health 
and Human Services bill eliminated Federal dollars for 
apprenticeship programs and called on the authorizers to pass 
an authorization bill. These dollars in the past were used to 
promote diversity and support intermediaries so that small 
businesses can benefit from apprenticeships. So, if that is the 
case, let's give the appropriators clarity in the form of an 
authorization. I know that we have a number of Members, some in 
this committee and some having been on the committee, who have 
been developing important pieces of legislation. Let's take a 
look at that and let's perhaps use that as a jumping off point 
for doing an authorization. I know, through my conversations 
with members of this committee, that apprenticeships have great 
support, and I am delighted to see that. I hope we can come 
together in a bipartisan manner to promote registered 
apprenticeship programs.</paragraph>

    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF MIKE BENNETT, VICE PRESIDENT, CIANBRO, PITTSFIELD,MAINE</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MIKE BENNETT">    And, first, Mr. Bennett, you're recognized for 5 minutes 
for your opening statement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bennett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bennett">Good morning, Chairman Guthrie, Ranking Member
Davis, Chairwoman Foxx, and members of the Subcommittee on 
Higher Education and Workforce Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bennett">Let me begin by thanking each of you for this opportunity 
to testify before you today on how to expand opportunities for 
Americans through workforce development and the earn-and-learn 
model. Again, my name is Michael Bennett. I am the vice 
president of the Cianbro Companies based out of Pittsfield, 
Maine. I have been with the organization for 21 years, and 
today I'm here to testify on behalf of Associated Builders and 
Contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bennett">As an employee/owner of Cianbro, I'm pleased to share with 
you that Cianbro is one of the United States' largest, most 
diversified, open shop, 100 percent employee-owned, 
construction companies. We operate in 41 States, and we employ 
more than 4,000 team members, managing and self-performing 
heavy civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, steel 
fabrication and coating work. We are recognized nationally in 
pursuing health and wellness in the workplace with such 
distinctions as the healthiest and safest company in America, 
and that was awarded by the American College of Occupational 
and Environmental Medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bennett">And while I would love to continue to talk about the 
company that I'm so proud of during this testimony this 
morning, that's really not why I'm here. I'm here to talk about 
the skills gap and the workforce shortage or, on a more macro 
level, developing the next generation of skilled workers, craft 
professionals, in a way that promotes safety, continual 
learning, and career development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bennett">Right now, in our industry, there are approximately 500,000 
skilled construction jobs available with modest economic growth 
and the potential of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, that 
number could balloon to 1 million by 2020, which is less than 3 
years away. To fill these jobs, we must have safe and efficient 
workers. To do this, we must have flexibility. Our clients are 
sophisticated. Our workforce development models must evolve to 
meet these demands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bennett">At Associated Builders and Contractors, as with Cianbro, we 
support all workforce programs that develop people and help 
them reach their potential, whether they're defined by the 
government or driven by industry. And we call this an all-of-
the-above approach to educating the construction professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bennett">I have listed some improvements in my written testimony, 
but I wanted to share a few of those verbally with you today as 
we develop the strategy it needs to include creating multiple 
pathways for apprenticeships by acknowledging industry-
recognized programs as we do registered apprenticeship 
programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bennett">We need to establish reciprocity across Federal and State 
apprenticeship councils. We need to allow for the utilization 
of nationally recognized portable industry credentialing 
programs with third-party oversight. The programs must be 
industry- and market-driven and flexible in structure, 
scheduling, and duration to address the changes with an 
industry's means, methods, and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bennett">Programs should be competency-based, allowing those who 
quickly master a skill to progress quicker than those who may 
require more time. And we need to allow for targeted programs 
to be developed. Competencies evolve quickly. With the changing 
business demands, an employee should be able to build those 
targeted competencies for those demand positions to meet our 
clients' needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bennett">Why does Cianbro value industry-recognized programs? 
Because they work. Industry-recognized programs come in all 
shapes and sizes, and that is the beauty of them. They provide 
the highest level of flexibility that benefits the worker, 
their company, and their client. Industry-recognized programs 
give the entire American public an opportunity to learn a 
skill, develop themselves, and build their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bennett">I'm not here today to criticize registered apprenticeship 
programs; rather, I'm here to urge you as lawmakers to support 
our industry by encouraging an all-of-the-above approach in 
filling the skills gap. This is why the construction industry 
is so excited about President Trump's executive order to expand 
on the apprenticeship opportunities for all Americans. By 
encouraging industry-recognized programs and embracing an all-
of-the-above approach to workforce development, the President's 
executive order shows a commitment to innovation and embracing 
the methods that work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bennett">And, in closing, I would like to leave you with these 
sentiments: Every day, I am thankful for the skilled craft 
professionals who provide me with the creature comforts we all 
enjoy: a warm and dry home, power, safe roads, reliable 
transportation. As a society, we highly value our doctors, our 
lawyers, our dentists, but sometimes we take for granted our 
other professionals. Our country requires and deserves to have 
the best of the best at all levels of these professions. So, as 
we work together to enhance the quality and quantity of our 
skilled vocations in this country, I offer you ABC's support in 
helping to enhance our existing registered apprenticeship 
program and, more importantly, structure a flexible, industry-
recognized, nonregistered model that warrants the same level of 
recognition and respect that our current registered programs 
provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bennett">I would like to thank the subcommittee for holding today's 
hearing on this important subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bennett">Mr. Chairman, this concludes my formal remarks. I'm 
prepared to answer any questions that you or the other members 
of the committee may have.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF ROBERT PEGLOW, STUDENT, KENTUCKY FEDERATION FOR</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ROBERT PEGLOW">    Mr. Peglow, you're now recognized for 5 minutes for your 
statement.
 ADVANCED MANUFACTURING EDUCATION (KYFAME), FRANKLIN, KENTUCKY
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Peglow</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Peglow">Hi. My name is the Robert Peglow, and my
personal safety commitment is to always wear my safety glasses 
when necessary. I am an apprentice sponsored by Kobe Aluminum 
in Bowling Green, Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Peglow">The KYFAME program was a once in a lifetime opportunity for 
me. It was also a second chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Peglow">My story begins in 2014 when I graduated from high school. 
I didn't know what I wanted to do. The only thing I knew was 
that I was going to college. I didn't like school, and I never 
have. I believe it is necessary and a great tool to obtain any 
career you would like, but it wasn't really for me. I went to 
college for 1 year after high school and didn't do so well. I 
wasn't focused or dedicated as much as I should have been, and 
I basically failed out. I took a year off to rethink what I 
really want to do and get my head in the right place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Peglow">In the spring of 2016, I decided I was ready to go back to 
college. I still didn't know for what, but I knew I needed to. 
I also knew I was ready. I had grown up and matured. I now had 
a fiancee to think about, instead of just myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Peglow">I discovered the KYFAME program through a friend of mine 
and decided I would explore the option. I talked with some of 
the people that are associated with the program and decided 
this is for me; this is the opportunity I have been searching 
for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Peglow">I started the program in the fall of 2016. I immediately 
discovered this wasn't an ordinary technical program. Most 
programs are 2-year programs where you earn a degree and then 
go to work in your field of study. In the KYFAME program, I was 
able to work 3 days a week as well as go to school the other 2 
days. I have learned more than I could have possibly imagined 
both in work and school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Peglow">The reason why this program works so well is that everyone 
involved is fully dedicated, from the sponsoring companies to 
the professors and everyone in between. After being in the 
program for a year, I can see that their sole purpose is to 
make this program succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Peglow">The professors give out their personal emails and cell 
phone numbers at the beginning of class and tell us to call or 
email any time if we need anything, and they mean it. They are 
dedicated to our success, and it shows. I have stayed after 
hours on multiple occasions with professors to study or ask 
questions. I am greeted with a smile every time and never 
rushed in our conversations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Peglow">There are many reasons this program has been such a 
blessing to me. I have had the opportunity to go to surrounding 
high schools and speak to students interested in the program. I 
have been able to develop my skills in numerous ways beyond my 
belief. I attended the national AMT conference and presented 
there as well. Coming into the program, I would not have 
considered myself a very good public speaker, nor did I like 
doing it. Now I am the first to volunteer for presentations and 
am happy to do them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Peglow">One of the biggest benefits I have discovered is the work 
aspect of the program. We get to work alongside experienced 
technicians every day at work. We also have an experienced 
maintenance adviser to help develop our skills and answer any 
questions we have. As students, we all go through the same 
curriculum together. There have been a few nights a group of us 
have met together and worked on projects or studied. This has 
been extremely helpful because we all have our own strengths 
and weaknesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Peglow">At the beginning of my statement, I gave my personal safety 
commitment. The number one thing we have been taught is our 
safety. We are expected to share our safety commitment at the 
beginning of conversations or presentations. This shows how 
committed we are in everything that we do. It is also just one 
of the many things I have learned along this journey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Peglow">Without this KYFAME, I can say I would not be where I am 
today. I found this program at a low point in my life, and it 
has helped me change my -- turn my path around. I am now at a 
high point in my short life, and I can truly say it is because 
of KYFAME. Speaking as a student from a KYFAME chapter, I 
appreciate this committee's work on apprenticeship programs. 
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you again 
for your time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ROB HOGAN">    I now recognize Mr. Hogan for 5 minutes for his opening 
statement.
MATERIAL DISTRIBUTION, NEWPORT NEWS SHIPBUILDING, NEWPORT NEWS, 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hogan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Hogan">Good morning and thank you, Chairman Guthrie,
Ranking Member Davis, and distinguished members on the 
Subcommittee of Higher Education and Workforce Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hogan">As kindly introduced by Mr. Scott, my name is Rob Hogan, 
and I'm the vice president of manufacturing and material 
logistics at Newport News Shipbuilding, which is a division of 
Huntington Ingalls Industries, based in Newport News, Virginia. 
And I'm honored to represent Newport News Shipbuilding in 
today's discussion and want to thank the subcommittee for this 
invitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hogan">Huntington Ingalls Industries is an American Fortune 500 
company with $7 billion in annual revenues and work backlog of 
approximately $20 billion. With facilities located in Virginia, 
Mississippi, California, Florida, Texas, and Colorado, we 
employ approximately 37,000 workers. Among them are more than 
15,000 craftsmen and -women, 5,000 engineers, 1,600 of whom 
have advanced degrees, and we employ approximately 5,000 
veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hogan">At Newport News Shipbuilding, we have been in business for 
131 years, and many of our employers are third-, fourth-, and 
even fifth-generation shipbuilders. Nearly 1,000 of our 
employers are what's called master shipbuilders. These are 
employees with 40 or more years of continuous service and a 
group of which I'm proud to be included. Our shipbuilders build 
the most advanced ships in the world for the United States Navy 
using our expertise in nuclear propulsion, naval design, and 
manufacturing. We are the sole designer and builder and 
refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and one of two 
providers of nuclear-powered submarines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hogan">In my role, I'm responsible for all shipyard manufactured 
material, material warehousing, and material distribution for 
all of our Navy and commercial programs, and while our 
facilities and manufacturing processes are critical, I will 
tell you it is our shipbuilders who really make us successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hogan">We employ 20,000 skilled craftsmen and -women and support 
personnel who are building our Nation's nuclear Navy. It is our 
responsibility and our top priority to train our shipbuilders 
and continuously develop their skills. We invest heavily in 
workforce development, spending over $80 million annually in 
various types of training. And I'll talk more in detail about 
our premier training program, The Apprentice School, in just a 
moment, but I would like to first talk about what we're doing 
to attract and hire our Nation's next generation of 
shipbuilders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hogan">Since we began building ships more than a century ago, two-
dimensional paper drawings have been the primary method for 
conveying design data to our shipbuilders. Today, we are 
migrating to an integrated digital enterprise to do away with 
the need for traditional drawings, and we're leveraging 
technology to transform how we build ships. Recognizing that 
this digital transformation will touch all areas of our 
business, we are coordinating with community colleges and 
university partners to incorporate digital shipbuilding 
techniques into many fields of study, including engineering, 
design, IT, and trades training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hogan">We are also actively involved with workforce investment 
boards, school districts, and local community colleges in 
several other ways. We support a Career Pathways program in 
concert with public schools throughout Hampton Roads where 
employees mentor students and provide opportunities to 
experience future careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Hogan">Another program we lead is called Girls with Engineering 
Minds in Shipbuilding, or GEMS, where our female engineers 
serve as mentors to middle school girls, encouraging them to 
pursue engineering studies in high school and beyond. We also 
offer local public school STEM educators and professional 
counselors the opportunity to take part in a 2-week paid 
internship to learn about shipbuilding and how the STEM 
concepts they teach are used in real workplace applications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Hogan">We participate in industry events and nationwide diversity 
conferences. We recruit onsite during the conferences, and 
doing this has helped us diversify our workforce. But another 
way we recruit and attract and train our future shipbuilders 
and future leaders is through our world-class apprentice 
school. For 98 years, the school has been a great example of an 
alternative choice to traditional college experience and has 
provided tremendous results for both students and our company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Hogan">Our apprentices are paid a salary and receive full benefits 
on day one, all while earning college credits and learning a 
trade in 19 shipbuilding disciplines and 8 advanced programs. 
Our graduates represent about 13 percent of our current 
workforce and more than 50 percent of our production management 
team. And although not obligated to stay with our company, more 
than 70 percent of our graduates are still with us after 15 
years of graduation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Hogan">Apprentice graduates are found at all levels of the 
organization and all levels of management. Currently, I am one 
of three senior leaders in the company who are graduates of The 
Apprentice School. The school has grown in popularity and 
become extremely competitive. On average, we receive more than 
2,800 applications a year for 240 openings. We currently have 
750 students enrolled, and we believe these are our future 
leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Hogan">In closing, these are just a few examples of how we are 
recruiting and retaining a skilled workforce capable of 
operating and keeping pace with today's rapidly evolving 
technologies. Training and professional development are not 
only vital for our success but are essential tactics in 
attracting and retaining millennial workers who demand ongoing 
learning and new opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Hogan">Thank you for the opportunity today, and I look forward to 
any questions you may have.</paragraph>
