</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">Well, good morning. I'd like to call the
order and the chair now recognizes himself for 5 minutes for an 
opening statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">And again, good morning to our witnesses and welcome to 
this legislative hearing on the Internet of Things. Today, we 
will discuss the bipartisan State of Modern Application, 
Research, and Trends of IoT Act, or the SMART Act IoT 
discussion draft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">The SMART IoT Act discussion draft is the result of work 
the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee has 
done over the past 2 years. Last July, this subcommittee held 
an Internet of Things Showcase. At that event, members invited 
companies from our districts and across America to demonstrate 
products and services in the IoT field. It was a wonderful 
opportunity to see this revolutionary work up close and 
interact with the inventors doing this important work. To 
accompany that Showcase, we held a hearing where participants 
from the Showcase discussed their companies, challenges they 
face with growing in this space, and what we, as policymakers, 
can do to help promote the continued development of the IoT 
solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">This January, we held a hearing on the state of 
manufacturing in the IoT space and over the following months we 
met with other builders, suppliers, customers, and experts to 
better understand IoT's enormous potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">This technology is having a real-life impact for many of 
our constituents. I've personally met with manufacturers in my 
district that are using this cutting-edge technology to 
maintain their machinery and keep production on track. I also 
met with farmers in Defiance, Ohio, who are using IoT for 
better grain management, increased planting and harvesting 
efficiency, and improved monitoring of the temperature in their 
storage facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">The draft legislation we discuss today is the result of 
important bipartisan work after hearing from the experts where 
we noticed one lingering question: What does the universe of 
rules, regulations, guidelines, and best practices look like 
for the IoT space?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">While we know there are many other topics of interest in 
this space, this legislation kicks off a process to give all 
stakeholders a base set of information to frame the other 
challenges without speculating or hypothesizing about what 
already exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">The IoT is already revolutionizing the way that we organize 
factories and supply chains, transport commodities like oil and 
gas, make manufacturing more efficient, maximize energy 
efficiency, and even restock our refrigerators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">This subcommittee has engaged in historic bipartisan work 
with the SELF DRIVE Act this Congress and I am pleased to see 
that cooperation continue with the SMART IoT. When safely 
applied to autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things holds 
the potential to significantly reduce traffic fatalities and 
make our roads safer while reducing costs through more 
efficient fuel consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">In these areas and more, the IoT holds the potential to 
greatly improve the lives of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">I want to thank my colleague, Representative Welch, for his 
willingness to continue our work together on this very 
important issue. As many here know, in previous Congresses 
Representative Welch and I started the Internet of Things 
Working Group. We heard from industry and other stakeholders 
about the importance of light-touch regulation to foster 
innovation and jobs here in the United States. This bipartisan 
draft is a result of the lessons learned in those meetings, 
this subcommittee's Disrupter Series hearings, and lays the 
groundwork for constructive conversations in the future. The 
SMART IoT Act will give all stakeholders, both private in 
industry and at the Federal level, a better sense of what 
guidelines and best practices exist or are in development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">As we all know, IoT issues cut across so many industries 
and so many Federal agencies. Ensuring that we know about 
overlaps or potential duplication is important for many reasons 
from ensuring efficient use of government resources to 
understanding how stakeholders are addressing some of the 
important but challenging issues of privacy and data security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">From the Department of Commerce's efforts to foster the 
advancement of the IoT ecosystem to the Department of 
Transportation's focus on advancing automated vehicle, so much 
work is being done in this space. We want to encourage our 
interagency collaboration and foster an environment where 
transparency is key. Likewise, I would like to ensure that the 
environment for innovation in the United States across all of 
these industries remains a priority by optimizing our own 
efforts to promote good, consistent government. I believe the 
SMART IoT Act is an important step in doing just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">And again, one of the things I always like to say is that 
one of the great things about serving on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee is that we kind of look over the horizon 
five to 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection to">When we hear from our witnesses we want to hear from you to 
know exactly where you're going to be because we don't want to 
have our regulators or our laws that we were thinking about 
enacting looking in the rear view mirror or at the end of a 
car. We need to be looking far out into the future.</paragraph>

    <opening>Prepared statement of Hon. Robert E. Latta</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">So, again, I want to thank our witnesses for being with us 
today and I look forward to your testimony today and, with 
that, I recognize the gentlelady from Illinois, the ranking 
member of the subcommittee, for 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">Good Morning and welcome to this legislative hearing on the 
Internet of Things. Today we will discuss the bipartisan State 
of Modern Application, Research, and Trends of IoT Act or the 
SMART IoT Act discussion draft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">The SMART IoT Act discussion draft is the result of work 
the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee has 
done over the past two years. Last July, this Subcommittee held 
an Internet of Things Showcase. At that event, Members invited 
companies from our Districts and across America to demonstrate 
products and services in the IoT field. It was a wonderful 
opportunity to see this revolutionary work up close and 
interact with the inventors doing this important work. To 
accompany that Showcase, we held a hearing where participants 
from the Showcase discussed their companies, challenges they 
face with growing in this space and what we, as policymakers, 
can do to help promote the continued development of IoT 
solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">This January we held a hearing on the state of 
manufacturing in the IoT space and over the following months we 
met with other builders, suppliers, customers and experts to 
better understand IoT's enormous potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">This technology is having a real-life impact for many of 
our constituents. I've personally met with manufacturers in my 
district that are using this cutting- edge technology to 
maintain their machinery and keep production on track. I also 
met with farmers in Defiance, Ohio who are using IoT for better 
grain management, increased planting and harvesting efficiency, 
and improved monitoring of the temperature in their storage 
facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">The draft legislation we will discuss today is the result 
of important bipartisan work after hearing from the experts 
where we noticed one lingering question-what does the universe 
of rules, regulations, guidelines, and best practices look like 
for the IoT space?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">While we know there are many other topics of interest in 
this space, this legislation kicks off a process to give all 
stakeholders a base set of information to frame the other 
challenges without speculating or hypothesizing about 
whatalready exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">The IoT is already revolutionizing the way that we organize 
factories andsupply chains, transport commodities like oil and 
gas, make manufacturing more efficient, maximize energy 
efficiency, and even restock our refrigerators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">This subcommittee has engaged in historic bipartisan work 
with the SELF DRIVE Act this Congress and I am pleased to see 
that cooperation continue with the SMART IoT Act discussion 
draft. When safely applied to autonomous vehicles the Internet 
of Things holds the potential to significantly reduce traffic 
fatalities, and make our roads safer while also reducing costs 
through more efficient fuel consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">In these areas and more, the IoT holds the potential to 
greatly improve the lives of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">I thank my colleague, Representative Welch, for his 
willingness to continue our work together on this very 
important issue. As many here know, in previous congresses 
Representative Welch and I started the Internet of Things 
Working Group. We heard from industry and other stakeholders 
about the importance of light-touch regulation to foster 
innovation and jobs here in the U.S. This bipartisan draft is a 
result of the lessons learned in those meetings, this 
subcommittees' Disrupter Series hearings, and lays the 
groundwork for constructive conversations in the future. The 
SMART IoT Act will give all stakeholders, both in private 
industry and at the Federal level, a better sense of what 
guidelines and best practices exist or are in development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. Robert E. Latta">As we all know, IoT issues cut across so many industries 
and so many Federal agencies. Ensuring that we know about 
overlaps or potential duplication is important for many reasons 
from ensuring efficient use of government resources to 
understanding how stakeholders are addressing some of the 
important but challenging issues of privacy and data security.</paragraph>

    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY, AREPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY">    From the Department of Commerce's efforts to foster the 
advancement of the IoT ecosystem to the Department of 
Transportation's focus on advancing automated vehicle, so much 
work is going on in this space. We want to encourage 
interagency collaboration and foster an environment where

Act is an important step in doing just that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Schakowsky</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">This subcommittee frequently discusses the Internet of 
Things. We have hearings on IoT in manufacturing and wearable 
devices, not to mention our IoT showcase last summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">Today, we transition from general discussion to discussion 
of actual legislation. The SMART IoT Act is a first step. It 
would require the Commerce Department to survey the use of 
connected devices and examine the Federal role in this space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">As the bill acknowledged, internet-connected devices 
provide an opportunity for economic growth. But we want to 
ensure that those devices are developed securely. My hope is 
that the report generated by the SMART IoT Act provides the 
foundation for further legislative efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">Our hearings on the Internet of Things have raised 
important issues. What privacy and cybersecurity protections 
are going to be baked into these devices? Normal household 
items can now collect very personal data that must be stored 
and used appropriately. Connected devices present new safety 
concerns. The Consumer Product Safety Commission just held a 
public hearing on IoT and safety last week with stakeholders on 
that very subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">We need the infrastructure to support the rise of connected 
devices including affordable broadband. The Internet of Things 
could also disrupt the current labor market. We must ensure 
workers are prepared for a changing economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">Finally, we must make the strategic investments in research 
to promote future innovation. Last week's hearing on quantum 
computing made clear that the United States is not providing 
the consistent support necessary to keep groundbreaking 
research moving forward. Standing on the sidelines is simply 
not an option. These are big issues for Congress to tackle and 
we must rise to the challenge. We know what happens if we rely 
on industry self-regulation. Consumer privacy goes unprotected 
and safety is put at risk. The SMART IoT Act should provide a 
resource for us to better understand the variety of devices on 
the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">I plan to use this information as I continue my push for 
comprehensive consumer privacy and data security legislation. 
We have had bipartisan furor over misuses of consumer data. 
It's time now for bipartisan solutions to the problem. The bill 
before us is a natural extension of the work that members of 
the subcommittee have been doing for the last couple of 
sessions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">In 2016, Congressmen Latta and Welch convened stakeholders 
for several forums under their IoT Working Group to discuss the 
Internet of Things and the issues that new technology raise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">In many ways, the study and the SMART IoT Act is a 
formalization of that very survey. In the coming weeks, I look 
forward to working on a bipartisan basis to move this 
legislation forward, and then I am ready to take the next step 
of updating consumer protections and funding key investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">The Internet of Things has tremendous potential. We must 
work together to make sure that America benefits from that 
opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">I thank you, Chairman Latta. I yield back, unless anybody 
wants the remaining time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">    I yield back.

    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREG WALDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GREG WALDEN">    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Oregon, the 
chairman of the full committee for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Walden</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Walden">Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and other members
on the committee and to our witnesses on the panel. Thank you 
for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walden">Today, we will hear testimony about the draft bill, the 
SMART IoT Act, to support the development of the Internet of 
Things here in the United States. This bipartisan effort 
underscores one of the key goals of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, and that is helping American entrepreneurs and 
established businesses expand to create jobs for American 
workers and help improve the lives of American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walden">So I would like to thank Chairman Latta and Representative 
Welch for working on this issue and finding a bipartisan path 
forward. This is what we do at the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, particularly on this subcommittee when faced with 
new technology policy questions. We have done that on the Self 
Drive Act. I would commend my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle for the good work there. Now we just need to get the 
Senate to move forward, as we are won't to do in many cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden">The Internet of Things, or IoT, does hold great promise to 
connect workers, suppliers, products, consumers throughout 
efficient networks that can save time, money, and bring about 
new innovation and resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden">Building this network won't be easy. We know that. It 
requires engineers, entrepreneurs, and visionaries. It also 
requires public policies that foresee a world designed for the 
next-century policies that foresee a world designed for the 
next century policies that are forward looking and that reflect 
a world to come of self-driving cars, self-organizing 
materials, and innovations we have yet to even think of. These 
must replace many of our still-existing rules and policies that 
reflect the old technologies of the last century. While America 
has changed, many of our regulations, unfortunately, have not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden">That is one of the purposes of this legislation that's 
before us today. It is meant to set the stage by making sure 
stakeholders are aware of the playing field and are not 
creating conflicting or duplicative obligations or 
requirements. So the SMART IoT Act will create the first 
compendium of essentially who is doing what in the IoT space. 
This includes the efforts undertaken by private industry as 
well as a review of what agencies are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden">Removing regulatory barriers to innovation is one of the 
most important duties of this committee. Doing so allows our 
economy to grow, our workers to flourish, and innovation to 
occur here in the United States. The best way to start is to 
know what is out there already or being developed today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden">It's important to note that since January of 2017 more than 
3 million new jobs have been created in America. The U.S. 
unemployment rate, now at 3.9 percent, is the lowest seen in 
this country since the year 2000, and what's more, this comes 
as more Americans rejoin the workforce, millions once again 
finding work after years of hardship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walden">So creating jobs and opportunity is a goal shared by all of 
us on this committee, in fact, reflected in the bipartisan work 
on the SMART IoT Act. Chairman Latta and Representative Welch 
have been working on these issues for several years now. Glad 
to see that this progress has been made and we have a great 
opportunity, going forward, to do even more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Walden">So, Mr. Chairman and members of both sides of the aisle, 
thanks for your good work on this. We have a couple hearings 
going on simultaneously, as I am sure our witnesses and members 
know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Walden">So some of us will be popping back and forth. But we value 
your testimony that we have here and the good bipartisan work.</paragraph>
</Statement>

    <opening>Prepared statement of Hon. Greg Walden</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden">And with that, I yield back the remaining balance of my

    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden">Good morning, and thank you to our witnesses for appearing

    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden">We have made great progress over the last two years in 
restoring jobs for American workers, restarting American 
manufacturing, and creating opportunities for Americans of all 
ages and backgrounds. But there is more work yet to be done. 
Legislation such as the draft bill we consider today is one way 
that we will continue to fulfill our duty to the American 
people to remove barriers to success while promoting policies 
that help our workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. Greg Walden">American ingenuity and leadership is once again 
transforming the world.That is something we can all be proud 
of. Thank you Chairman Latta for the leadership you have shown,

    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR., A REPRESENTATIVEIN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. FRANK PALLONE"> Well, thank you very much. The gentleman yields
back, and the chair now recognizes the gentleman from New 
Jersey, the ranking member of the full committee for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pallone</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pallone">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pallone">Today's hearing on the draft SMART Internet of Things Act 
is the next step in this subcommittee's review of new and 
evolving technological development and I commend Chairman Latta 
and Representative Welch for working together over the last 
several years to explore and learn how the Internet of Things, 
or IoT, can enrich our lives, help us be more efficient, and 
grow the U.S. economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pallone">Today, more and more people have multiple internet-
connected devices in their homes, things like thermostats, 
vacuums, and digital personal assistants, and more and more 
people are wearing internet-connected devices such as fitness 
trackers. But IoT is not limited to consumer products. 
Connected devices of all kinds are used in practically every 
industry sector like manufacturing, agriculture, and medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pallone">We have learned about drones that fly into dangerous areas 
to assess hazards, sensors helping farmers understand the 
topography acidity of their land, and doctors receiving real-
time data from monitors so that patients in remote areas do not 
have to travel for daily appointments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pallone">And today we are considering a bipartisan draft bill that 
would direct the Department of Commerce to conduct a 
comprehensive study and report on the Internet of Things. 
Commerce will survey the industry sectors that make internet-
connected devices as well as all industry sectors that use 
those devices. The study will also look at how the Federal 
Government oversees the use and development of connected 
devices, which agencies deal with the Internet of Things, what 
expertise those agencies have, and what entities those agencies 
interact with, and the study will identify government resources 
available to consumers and small businesses to help them 
evaluate connected devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pallone">The report will provide a one-stop source of how businesses 
are integrating connectivity and how the Federal Government is 
helping the country adapt to this age of connectivity. Federal 
and local government agencies could also use the report to 
better coordinate their work and I hope the study will 
encourage them to do so. And any report will be a snapshot in 
time, but given the integration of IoT into all parts of our 
lives in the global economy, the report will provide a jumping-
off point for more work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pallone">I would certainly like to see cybersecurity issues given 
more emphasis when we look at IoT. Throughout our review, 
cybersecurity was the issue that came up most often. 
Cybersecurity is imperative to keeping ourselves and our 
country safe from malicious actors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pallone">And I know some stakeholders have asked that cybersecurity 
be specifically called out in the study. I would support such a 
change. But whether it's made part of the study required by 
this bill or not, Congress must take action to ensure that 
strong cybersecurity and data security are fundamental to IoT.</paragraph>

    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. PETER WELCH">    So I am glad that this subcommittee is working on this 
bipartisan legislation and I'd like to yield the balance of my 
time to the sponsor, Congressman Welch.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Welch">Thank you very much, and I want to thank
Chairman Latta and Ranking Member Schakowsky for this hearing. 
It was great to work with Mr. Latta too in the IoT Working 
Group--21 members that had hearings in advance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Welch">We are trying to get educated before we pass legislation, 
which isn't necessarily how we usually operate. But this is a 
huge opportunity with the Internet of Things. McKinsey and 
Company did a study and says that it can be between $4 and $11 
trillion annually by 2025. So that's really quite 
extraordinary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Welch">My colleagues have already spoken about what many of these 
opportunities are and also, Ranking Member Schakowsky, I think 
pointing out some of the implications that we have to contend 
with with labor is really, really important for all of us to 
keep in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Welch">But I'll just give one example. In Vermont, the brutal 
pressure on our dairy farmers right now--the price is down, the 
costs are up--and technology is helping some of those farmers 
hang on. And Mangan Brothers, a dairy farm in East Fairfield, 
Vermont, has a computerized internet-based milking system 
that's really been helpful to them. They installed a milking 
parlor about two decades ago and now what happens when the cow 
comes in they have a pedometer on their leg, and as soon as the 
cow crosses the threshold of the milking parlor the sensor 
picks up which cow it is and relays the information to the 
computer and all the statistics about the cow's movements and 
body temperature and other pertinent information is sent to the 
computer, and it's even relevant for when the breedings are 
done just based on activity spikes. It also gives them a report 
at the end of every milking day with respect to the salt 
content and that's an indicator that allows the farmers to take 
steps to avoid diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Welch">So it's a big deal in terms of productivity for them and it 
is made possible by the Internet of Things. And just the last 
point in my last few seconds, the only way we are going to have 
the Internet of Things in rural America is to have broadband in 
rural America, and that's another enormous challenge we have 
and it's woefully underserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Welch">So we can talk all we want about the Internet of Things, 
but unless we have broadband it's not going to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Welch">    So I yield back and thank my colleagues for the time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Latta">The gentleman yields back, and I just want to
say just briefly I really appreciate all the work that you and 
I have done on IoT and also not only chairing the working group 
but also working together chairing the rural broadband, so I 
appreciate all you've been doing and thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Latta">That now concludes members' opening statements and the 
chair now reminds members that pursuant to committee rules, all 
members opening statements will be made part of the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Latta">And, again, I want to thank all of our witnesses for being 
with us today. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to 
testify before the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Latta">Today's witnesses will have the opportunity to give 5-

example, the agricultural sector for better crop yields, health 
care for improved patient outcomes, and manufacturing for 
improved operations and maintenance. One study has shown that 
industrial manufacturing IoT spending is predicted to increase 
to $890 billion worldwide by 2020. And, of course, government 
also stands to benefit from IoT by creating efficiencies in 
public services, by finding new value for citizens, enhancing 
capabilities, and streamlining processes. IoT may provide a 
much-needed answer for agencies seeking to meet increasing 
citizen needs with decreasing budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Day">And, Chairman Latta, back home in the Buckeye State, 
Columbus, which was awarded the DoT's 2016 Smart Cities 
Challenge Grant, is using IoT in research and development to 
create smart vehicle technologies. Another study has shown that 
wireless providers will invest $275 billion towards building 5G 
networks, which will be part of the connectivity backbone of 
smart cities and IoT. This investment will add $500 billion in 
GDP and 3 million jobs to the American economy. This number 
pales in comparison to the $11 trillion worldwide economic 
impact that is predicted by 2025 for IoT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Day">Needless to say, IoT is an economic game changer. The 
Chamber's president and CEO, Tom Donohue, has stated that 
technology must be embraced as the growth driver and game 
changer that it is. That is why it is so critical that the 
United States maintain leadership in IoT by adopting the right 
regulatory framework.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Day">I would like to suggest a couple of ideas for your 
consideration to strike the correct regulatory balance. 
Congress and agencies should do more to reduce the regulatory 
burdens, compliance costs, and overlap. Government should 
evaluate existing regulatory activities and bring together 
stakeholders in government industry to shape IoT policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Day">Legislation like the DIGIT Act and the draft legislation 
today, the SMART IoT Act, are much-needed steps in the right 
direction to achieve this goal. Additionally, actions like 
those done by the FCC led by Commissioner Carr to streamline 
communications siting rules are also to be praised. As IoT is 
still in its infancy, policymakers should avoid the temptation 
to impose prescriptive regulations on IoT and single out IoT 
for regulation for issues such as privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Day">Congress should continue a policy of technology neutrality 
and, finally, a skilled workforce will also be critical to the 
development of this new technology and investment in human 
capital will determine which countries lead, going forward in 
this space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Day">We are currently witnessing a new industrial revolution led 
by advanced technology including IoT, which is a force for good 
that should be fostered by smart regulatory frameworks that 
encourage investment, promote innovation, as well as connect 
and empower all Americans.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF MICHELLE RICHARDSON</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MICHELLE RICHARDSON">    Ms. Richardson, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Chairman Latta, Ranking Member Schakowsky,
thank you for the opportunity to testify today on behalf of the 
Center for Democracy and Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Richardson">CDT is a nonprofit technology policy organization dedicated 
to protecting civil liberties and human rights in a digital 
world including privacy, free speech, and access to 
information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Richardson">We believe the Internet of Things has the power to enrich 
people's lives in ways both big and small. But we also 
recognize that the Internet of Things poses unique privacy and 
security challenges. Many of these devices collect information 
that is intensely personal yet ungoverned by U.S. policy and 
privacy law. It has also become common to hear of serious 
security breaches which have allowed hackers to use IoT devices 
to either steal information or participate as part of a botnet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Richardson">CDT's preference for technology policy is for private 
industry to voluntarily create and adopt standards. The 
government plays an important role in setting standards and 
incentivizing good behavior, especially in sectors where 
security failures had extreme consequences or in the consumer 
market when users don't have a fair shot at understanding or 
managing products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Congress has the authority and the responsibility to 
determine whether the current government and private balance is 
the right one. We hope this bill will help collect information 
to assess that in two ways. First, we hope the SMART IoT Act 
will collect information to determine whether voluntary 
standards and privacy standards are not only being created 
whether they are being adopted by a critical mass of industry 
players. Voluntary standards are the default in the IoT space 
and billions of devices are up and operating on the internet, 
and more are coming. The foundational question we should be 
asking is whether this approach is working as a general matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Second, the study should tease out any overlap or gaps in 
government oversight of these IoT devices. Cross-agency 
coordination is crucial to sharing information and will help 
make sure that the government is not issuing conflicting 
guidance or requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Now, we recommend the bill clearly state that nothing in it 
should be interpreted to discourage agencies from continuing 
work in critical areas like connected cars or health devices. 
Agencies like the FDA and NHTSA are driving standards for 
devices or systems that have literal life or death consequences 
and that work cannot wait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Richardson">While industry deserves an overarching government plan for 
IoT, IoT is already too large and too diverse to cabin in a 
single agency, and developing sector-specific expertise will 
ensure that government involvement is supported by the 
technical and policy knowledge needed to make the right 
decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Richardson">After you receive this report, we expect that you will find 
that one of the largest gaps in standards and oversight is in 
the consumer market. As Ms. Vachani mentions in the IoT report 
for Intel, most IoT devices and applications relate to 
industrial products, smart cities, and the health industry. 
Many of these devices are subject to practical and regulatory 
limits already. For example, some of these devices are embedded 
in critical infrastructure, which is already regulated writ 
large, and some of these devices are really quite simple and do 
not collect personal information or offer computing power that 
makes them attractive hacking targets. Think of sensors that 
only measure water pressure or county the number of cars that 
pass through an intersection. The users of these sorts of 
devices also are often more sophisticated and the corporate 
versus corporate relationship can contractually ensure that IoT 
devices continue to work safely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Richardson">But the consumer ecosystem does not have many of these 
checks and balances. Consumers are stuck in a take it or leave 
it system and they will not have the option to leave it much 
longer, as connectivity is built into everything. Lay users 
just do not have the technical capacity to understand and 
control the current crop of IoT devices on the market. They 
also have few legal remedies when something does go wrong. If 
security fails, devices can be a gateway to stealing personal 
information or subject the owner to actual spying. Failures can 
harm a person or her property in the real world like smart 
locks that can remotely open front doors. And these devices can 
be taken over as part of a botnet that can send scam email or, 
in the case of the Mirai botnet, take down websites and 
internet access, more generally.</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Ms. Richardson follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Ms. Richardson ">    In other words, there's a lot at stake in the consumer 
market and the current system is just not working. We are 
hoping that this committee finds the report to be just the 
jumping off point for better oversight of consumer products and 
we look forward to working with you and your staff on this 
bill.

    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Latta">Well, thank you very much for your testimony.</paragraph>

    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF DIPTI VACHANI</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DIPTI VACHANI">    Ms. Vachani, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Schakowsky, and 
members of the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Vachani">I appreciate the opportunity to testify today on behalf of 
Intel Corporation and I commend you and Congressman Welch for 
your leadership on the SMART IoT Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Vachani">First, I would like to turn to the vast benefits of the IoT 
and discuss real-life IoT use cases that are relevant to the 
committee's jurisdiction. Gartner predicts that IoT technology 
will be in 95 percent of electronics for new product design by 
2020. The transformational, societal, and economic benefits 
that will flow from this broad deployment of IoT technology is 
what energizes Intel. And the SMART IoT Act is a welcome 
indication that this enthusiasm is matched by this 
subcommittee. The IoT is already transforming sectors like 
health care, smart cities, and transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Vachani">I would like to go over a few use cases. Smart health 
care--less than .01 percent of patient data is available beyond 
the bedside for health care teams to make clinical decisions. 
To solve this problem, Medical Informatics, Intel, and Dell 
partnered on an FDA-cleared IoT platform called Sickbay. 
Sickbay continuously captures patient data from the bedside 
medical devices and transforms it into actionable intelligence. 
This enables care teams to make better and fast decisions and 
predict patient deterioration before it occurs. In the last 4 
1A\1/2\ years, Texas Children's Hospital used Sickbay to 
improve health care for 2.1 million patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Smart cities--92 percent of the world's population lacks 
access to clean air and leading to millions of deaths annually. 
To address this, Intel and Bosch developed IoT-powered 
pollution monitoring systems that provide intelligent data and 
enable real-time analysis. These IoT systems are used by 
governments to improve air quality in congested cities like 
Pune, India, by factory owners to track emissions and provide 
safety checks for all workers, by construction site managers to 
provide air quality warnings and improve efficiency, and by 
cities to provide residents with recommended times for 
exercising outdoors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Use case number three, transportation--as the subcommittee 
is aware, the impact of autonomous vehicles will be life 
changing, particularly in our disabled community and aging 
population. The number of U.S. residents aged 78 and older will 
increase by 53.7 million by 2030, compared to just 30.9 million 
in 2014. Many of these residents live in communities with poor 
or no public transportation. AVs will offer vastly improved 
mobility benefits. Intel applauds the committee's leadership on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Next, I would like to offer Intel's strong support for the 
SMART IoT Act and respectfully offer recommendations to enhance 
the legislation. Nations are racing to lead in this competitive 
IoT sector. It has been Intel's strong desire that the Federal 
Government be more proactive in ensuring U.S. IoT leadership in 
declaring the U.S. the IoT a national priority for the 
innovation in investment and competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Vachani">We applaud the subcommittee for its bipartisan work to set 
America on its leadership path by ensuring an IoT study and 
recommendations to promote IoT adoptions to grow our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Vachani">I was on the Hill last October to unveil a broadly 
supported industry report on IoT. Intel recommendations to the 
SMART IoT reflect this report. First, we urge the subcommittee 
to include a robust definition in IoT that is nonproprietary, 
neutral regarding technologies and applications, and 
contemplates both the consumer and the industrial IoT. In fact, 
industrial, smart city, and connected health will make up 70 
percent of the use cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Second, we urge you to seek specific recommendations that 
would be highly impactful on laying the groundwork for the 
national IoT strategy. This includes recommendations on 
incentives for the Federal Government and agencies to adopt IoT 
technologies to advance their Federal mission including smart 
infrastructure solutions. How the Federal Government can best 
support global industry-led IoT standard efforts and avoid new 
regulations that duplicate existing industry standards and a 
criteria for the Federal Government to invest in IoT public-
private partnerships and testbeds.</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Ms. Vachani follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Ms. Vachani ">    Thank you for the opportunity to share Intel's thoughts on 
the SMART IoT Act. We look forward to working with you to see 
this bipartisan bill enacted into law--that first step towards 
a national IoT strategy--and ensure U.S. leadership in this 
transformational sector.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Latta">Well, again, I want to thank our witnesses for
being with us today. We really appreciate your testimony, and 
that will conclude our testimony from our witnesses and we'll 
begin our questioning from our members, and I will recognize 
myself for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Latta">    Mr. Day, do you believe a compendium of all current Federal 
action on IoT-related issues will help promote interagency 
collaboration and consistent federal action?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Day">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again, I think what
we've heard is that the Internet of Things holds incredible 
promise for our economy and the quality of life for citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Day">I do. I think the draft that we have before us today helps 
with increased transparency and how government regulates this 
technology in a better way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Day">    We are firm believers that the government should make data 
available and complying a list of Federal policies that affect 
IoT, I believe, would go a long way in enabling the companies 
that we are working with at the Chamber and others and 
especially also small and startup companies to understand the 
regulatory environment that we are faced with today.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Latta">Yes, let me ask you about that right there
because I know that when my friend from Vermont and I were 
doing our Working Group meetings--and actually we had them 
right here in this room--it didn't make any difference if 
you're from the East Coast, the West Coast, the Midwest, what 
type you're in, as Ms. Vachani was talking about, from 
everything from health care to manufacturing to FinTech, you 
name it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Latta">There was one thing that we heard from everyone--that we 
needed to make sure that we have a soft touch regulation out 
there so people can be out there innovating and it's no--we 
didn't hear anybody ever say that they were against regulations 
but not to have anything that was over burdensome that they 
couldn't go out and regulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Latta">    When you're talking about these smaller companies out 
there, could you talk to me or talk to the committee a little 
bit about what you have heard from them some of the major 
hurdles that they're facing right now or things that need to be 
overcome?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Day">Absolutely, and I think what's exciting about this
is that this does impact middle America, the coasts. Everyone, 
as you said, is impacted by this and I think when you're a 
small business and a startup, and my focus at the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce in the emerging technology space, it is just that. 
It's emerging. It's changing by the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Day">We are still learning what the technology means and so I 
think there needs to be a structure but not too prescriptive in 
the approach and, you know, quite frankly, business leaders and 
new startups and entrepreneurs are looking to run their 
businesses with the support of the government but not being 
told exactly how to do it because we are still working on the 
benefits and how this actually applies to the companies that we 
are working with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Day">    And so I think what business leaders want to know is give 
me the ability to invest, to be able to take my idea to the 
next step but don't regulate me so much that I am not able to 
produce quality results and in the end be successful as a 
startup.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Latta">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Latta">Ms. Vachani, again, I would like to turn a question to you 
now. What are some of the IoT applications that Intel is 
focused on and can you explain how those applications benefit 
the economy and jobs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Latta">    And, again, I was very interested because I know you were 
going through the health care, the manufacturing, the 
transportation, and construction, but if you could get a little 
bit more in depth with that I would appreciate it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Absolutely. So we have over 500 market-ready
solutions that we work with the industry to create because one 
of the common misconceptions about IoT it's vertical, right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Vachani">You have a retail solution and you have an industrial 
solution, and honestly, when you look across the board, our 
customers are looking at solutions that go across multiple 
industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Vachani">And so there are multi-industry solutions. They don't 
necessarily sit in one nice little box as a vertical, and so 
you will see an industrial environment where they're trying to 
do predictive maintenance at the same time as inventory 
management, the same time as building management, and you see 
several different vertical like solutions coming together into 
one application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Vachani">And we believe that the maximum benefit is when these 
solutions start to come together. One of the areas that I want 
to reflect on is that the U.S. is actually a leader worldwide 
in our innovation that we have in IoT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Vachani">So you will see solutions overseas that have Intel or other 
companies within the United States technology, our AI 
applications, our software, that are driving innovation around 
the world, and that's expanding our economy just the same 
because that's created here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    It's built here by us and by our companies that are 
innovating at a faster rate.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Latta"> In my last 24 seconds follow up with that
because, again, it's good to hear the United States is leading 
on this. What's happening across the globe that is making the 
United States be the innovator out there?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Well, I think that what we come down to is we
have some companies here that are able to look at these 
solutions like Intel, truly, and that goes from the data center 
all the way to the thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    And so we can look at this problem holistically and that's 
important that we do that, as well as some of the new 
technologies that we come up with with specifically integrated 
circuits as well as the software and artificial intelligence 
and the leadership in artificial intelligence within this 
country.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Latta"> Well, thank you very much. My time has expired
and I yield back, and I recognize the gentlelady from Illinois, 
the Ranking Member of the subcommittee, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Schakowsky</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">Connected devices can follow us through every aspect of our 
lives, collecting data. At the same time, the committee has 
spent a lot of time looking at how the data collected about us 
is used by companies and by the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">We heard from Facebook about how much data it collects, how 
it shared that data with third parties, and how it used our 
data to sell advertising. As more and more devices collect data 
about us, that data can be used to affect our decision making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">    So, Ms. Richardson, let me ask you some questions. While 
IoT devices provide benefits, are you concerned about their 
data collection?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Absolutely. The way the U.S. works its
privacy law is to do it categorically, to cover, for example, 
communications, financial data, health information held by 
doctors, and if you don't fall into one of these categories 
you're just not protected and there are very few, if any, 
limits on how the information can be collected and used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    It's going to be possible that a lot of these IoT devices 
are going to collect data that is not covered by one of these 
categories already and that would be one of the benefits of 
having a baseline comprehensive privacy law in the United 
States as we would not have so many cracks and you would see 
the IoT data have some procedural rights for Americans.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Schakowsky</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">I would like to work with you on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">Five years ago, we were barely talking about location data 
or facial recognition and now we are talking about genetic 
information also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">    Ms. Richardson, should we be concerned about what personal 
information is out there and how the kinds of personal 
information available to collect change over time?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Yes. The information that is collected by
these devices is really unique. You only have to go back a few 
years before we widely collected things, like you mentioned, 
that reflect, let's say, your heartbeat, your location, the 
food you eat, where you go, the people you know, and it can all 
be aggregated in ways that give a very rich picture about 
people in ways that they might be shocked to know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Ms. Richardson">I think one of the things you saw at your hearing with 
Facebook is that the surprise factor is really what upsets 
people in many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    So this is something we need to watch more closely and, 
hopefully, a universal privacy law would be able to protect 
that sort of really sensitive information right now.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Schakowsky</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">So it's clear that privacy legislation is
absolutely necessary. I like the way you talk about it in a 
nonsiloed way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">In fact, the Federal Trade Commission has recommended many 
times that Congress enact comprehensive privacy legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky">    Ms. Richardson, again, the SMART IoT Act would examine how 
different industries are using and developing IoT. Could such a 
resource be helpful in the development of best practices for 
privacy and IoT devices?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Ms. Richardson"> Yes. I think that would help us get a
better view of where the industry is going. I think you're 
going to find, though, that there are very few when it comes to 
privacy and for the most part the standards are about 
interoperability, technical standards, and cybersecurity, and 
you're going to find a really big gap here.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Schakowsky</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"> So the FTC recommended in the past that
privacy legislation should not be IoT specific. Do you agree 
with that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Ms. Richardson"> Absolutely. We want a forward-looking tech-
neutral law that will be able to cover all sorts of information 
regardless of the type of device or entity that's creating it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Schakowsky</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Ms. Schakowsky"> So Mr. Day said that one of the things that
we need to worry about is too much regulation standing in the 
way. Don't you think there's a balance, though, of making sure 
that we set some rules of the road, some guidelines that 
industry needs to follow?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Yes, and in a way those can drive
innovations themselves. You end up having requirements that 
inspire new solutions to protect privacy and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    And CDT does believe in a light touch but there are a few 
places that government intervention--or oversight is maybe a 
better word--is most urgent and that's where you look at things 
like cars or pacemakers and devices that really have life or 
death consequences if something goes wrong, and I think we are 
seeing the consumer market is just an area where everyday 
people are not able to make informed decisions about the 
devices they're buying, the information that's collected and 
then how to secure the devices.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Latta">Thank you. The gentlelady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Latta">    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costello</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Costello">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Costello">I want to sort of continue down that path of consumer-
facing devices and speak a little bit more about being a small 
business owner or a startup, and approaching the infrastructure 
purchase questions from an adequate security measure 
perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Costello">In what direction do we need to head--and it may not be 
necessarily government, it may just be more industry--in what 
direction do we have to head in order to make sure that we are 
getting it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Costello">    A rather open-ended question, but why don't I start with 
you, Ms. Richardson?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. Richardson">As far as security standards go, we have
endorsed tech-neutral cybersecurity controls. So these are 
really top-level decisions that both the manufacturers and the 
operators can make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Ms. Richardson">So, for example, when you're building a device you should 
always have the capacity to update the software, right, and you 
could say that without getting a really prescriptive 
technology, description of how to do that and each company can 
decide how to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    And there is a list of maybe a half dozen of these sorts of 
practices that I think are reasonably set as the baseline and 
they include other things like being able to have passwords or 
other authenticators that can be changed and things like that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costello</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Costello"> Following through on that, steps or
approaches that small and medium enterprises can utilize to 
overcome concerns or difficulties relating to the system 
integration side of IoT solutions, to--go ahead.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. Richardson"> Can you repeat the question about system
integration?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costello</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Costello"> Small and medium enterprises, overcoming
their concerns or difficulties relating to system integration 
of IoT solutions. If you're a really big company, integrating 
is very easy. If you're a small----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Not actually. It's actually difficult
either way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Honestly, the number-one challenge for IoT right now is 
scale. Scale is very difficult, right, and even with a company 
as large as, you would say, Intel, if you look at our market-
ready solutions, rarely do we have a solution that only 
involves Intel. There is others. There's Dell involved--as I 
mentioned, many of our solutions--Bosch was involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. Richardson">And so you're talking about multiple companies coming 
together to include a complete solution and for a small or 
medium-sized company that gets even more difficult, right. And 
this is where the industry standards come into play because 
when we start to create standards that are interoperable and 
that we know work together that a small or medium-sized company 
can create a piece and we know that that piece will work with 
the rest of the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    And Intel and many other companies--we were here with 
Samsung--are working across the industry to help those 
standards get deployed and become more consistent 
interoperable.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costello</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Costello"> So when you use the term scale there, what
are you saying?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. Richardson">What I mean by scale there is we are able
to create--I will give you an example. We'll create a proof of 
concept inside of the walls of Intel in our building and it 
will look beautiful and work perfectly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Richardson">It'll have the in system, the data center. It'll have the 
store, let's say. It'll do inventory management. As soon as I 
take that out of my office inside of Intel and try to put into 
a Levi's store or I try to put it inside of a mall, now it's 
working with everything else around it and that's when we 
struggle, because there's other systems. There's old data. 
There's new data. Maybe the infrastructure is there. Maybe they 
have connectivity. Maybe they don't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    And so that becomes more difficult for us to deploy and 
then think about thousands and then add millions to that, 
right. And that's where we struggle with being able to take 
that technology and deploy it into multiple instances across 
the world.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costello</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Costello">That's helpful. You were speaking about
industry standards, and depending upon what industry we are 
talking about--health care, manufacturing, whatever it may be--
the place that you go for that industry standard to make its 
way into code or regulation or whatever the case may be is 
oftentimes different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Costello">    Share with me challenges or frustrations in navigating 
Federal regulatory agencies to determine IoT industry standards 
and how we could go about improving that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Richardson"> Well, one, I would encourage----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costello</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Costello"> That's a question for everyone.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Yes. I can start. One, I would encourage
you to look at the industry standards that are already 
available to us because the industry is starting to coalesce 
around a few standards that go across multiple industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Again, we are not saying this is just for industrial or 
environment or it's just for retail. This is how we collect 
data across the board and that could be a standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    So I would encourage you to look, and I think that's part 
of the recommendations here, is to look at what the industry is 
already doing and leverage that because we have come across 
together in this space, and I will allow you guys some time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Latta"> Yes. Since the gentleman's time has expired, if
you all could just real briefly answer that would be great.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Day">Well, I think what we are doing today in
discussing is the right first step. I think between the DIGIT 
Act and what we are doing with the legislation in draft form 
today is that first step and it's the right approach to some of 
these issues that we are discussing and bringing forward today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Day">    Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Latta"> Would you like to comment? OK, thank you very
much.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costello</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Costello"> Yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Latta">The gentleman yields back. His time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Latta">    And the chair now recognizes the gentleman from California 
for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cardenas</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">Thank you very much, Chairman Latta and
Ranking Member Schakowsky, for having his important hearing and 
I would like to thank the witnesses for coming forward and 
enlightening us as to what's going on out there in the real 
world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">My background is in engineering. I got my electrical 
engineering degree from UCSB back in the days when we used 
punch cards in our programming, your technical you lack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">So I think a lot has changed, but I think that many of us 
do welcome these changes, and having said that I think that 
public policy needs to make sure that we are mindful of this 
fast-moving effort of the Internet of Things and how it affects 
individuals' privacy, how it affects industries, how it affects 
jobs, how it affects the jobs of today and tomorrow, and how do 
we get American workers ready and prepared to be the workers of 
today and tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">These are the kinds of things that weigh on my mind. During 
my careers, I actually owned a small business at one time so I 
know what it's like for a small business to be able to pull 
something off the shelf in a very efficient cost-effective 
manner and I think the Internet of Things is making that much 
more efficient every single day and making smaller businesses, 
especially mom and pops a heck of a lot more competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">Wherein, the old days, maybe back in my days in the '80s 
and '90s when I was a business owner, everything was in maybe 
fives and tens of thousands of dollars to get an innovative 
device. Now, it appears that we can actually get an innovative 
device that changes and allows us to be more efficient and hire 
more individuals and grow our business to the tune of hundreds 
of dollars. Is that correct? Do we have devices out there that 
maybe 20 years ago to innovate were in the thousands of dollars 
and today it might be only a few hundred?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">    Can one of you give me an example of something that you can 
think of that actually touches on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Absolutely. If you think about, for example,
the building management that was in New York, the deployment 
that we did, those were sensors that were not very expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Ms. Vachani">We are talking sensors that are dollars on--as it is, and 
they can look into a room and save a small business on their 
costs--their infrastructure costs by looking at occupancy 
inside of a room and deciding that the AC needs to be turned on 
because no one's in the room. This isn't expensive technology 
from that standpoint but it's changing the way we live and the 
way we operate within our businesses and saving us cost, right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. Vachani">One of the major ways that this building in New York was 
able to save money is we found a leak in one of their pipes. 
Again, we are talking about a sensor that's able to determine 
that there's a leak in a pipe and will waste, right, and they 
were able to reduce that cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    And so from that standpoint, innovation isn't necessarily 
requiring extensive amount of investment but there are ways 
where we can start to make decisions very quick when this data 
comes together.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cardenas</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">Ms. Richardson, I have a question for you
about consumer applications and how do you think the Internet 
of Things devices are being used inside manufacturing 
workplaces?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">    I happen to represent a community in Los Angeles that has a 
big corridor of manufacturing, tens of thousands of 
manufacturing jobs in my district.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Yes, and I think it's still unknown how
this is going to affect the workforce on balance, right. You're 
going to create new jobs of the people who actually have to 
create the devices, and we hope that a strong privacy and 
security practice will create professionals to deal with that 
also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Ms. Richardson">I think there are questions to ask about whether they will 
replace human beings on the job. But there will always be 
decisions that human beings have to make that we can't let 
computers do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    So I don't think it will eradicate humans altogether.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cardenas</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Cardenas"> Well, on that note, there are things such as
smart helmets and smart glasses that now can be deployed in the 
workplace, and do you have any comments about how these devices 
might to affecting somebody's privacy in the workplace?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Yes, and peoples' privacy in the workplace
is much more limited than in their home or out in public. This 
is long established that employers can really control the type 
of information that they're collecting on their property and 
while they're conducting their services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Ms. Richardson">I think, though, when you see a lot of these sorts of 
applications they don't have to necessarily collect a lot of 
personal information, right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    This is where, again, the controls built into the products 
on the front end are important so that you can collect the 
information necessary for your work but not, let's say, what 
they do on their breaks or the conversations they're having or 
things that are really not core to doing the job.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cardenas</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">Thank you. Mr. Welch talked about the cow and
I was thinking, wow, I hope that cow is not creeped out about 
the privacy about every time she walks into the barn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">[Laughter.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Cardenas">    But, Ms. Vachani, I know Intel has been active on the 
connected worker's front and arguing that they keep workers 
safe and productive. Can you give us an example of that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Absolutely. Actually, there's a really good
example with a fireman which resonates with me, right. By 
connecting a fireman that goes inside a building we now know--
by the sensors we can tell what is the oxygen level around him, 
or her, if the firewoman--the fireman is laying down or 
standing up, what exact location they're in within the building 
if they're laying down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    These are opportunities for us to save lives of some of our 
workers that are working in critical conditions. I think it's 
essential.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cardenas</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Cardenas"> Thank you. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Latta">Thank you. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Latta">And I am sure they only have happy cows in Vermont.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Latta">The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from California for 
5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Latta">Mrs. Walters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Latta">    Mr. Day, do you believe that a review of all regulations 
guidelines standards and other policy efforts undertaken by 
Federal agencies is important and do you think it will assist 
us in ensuring consistent policy of Internet of Things-related 
matters?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Day">Thank you for the question, Congresswoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Day">Yes, I do. I think the SMART IoT Act, by studying all 
sectors of the IoT and how they regulate technology and current 
policies will go a long way in cutting down overly burdensome 
regulations and duplicative regulation as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Day">I think when you're looking at the broad spectrum of 
applications here it's critical when you're looking at the 
impact on self-driving cars to getting a patient through a 
hospital more efficiently, cost effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Day">It's all important, and I think the legislation before us 
today will streamline that process and benefit by, frankly, 
everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Day">Mrs. Walters. OK. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Day">    And Ms. Vachani, can you please discuss the benefits to a 
connected world both for business like Intel as well as 
consumers who use Internet of Things products?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Ms. Vachani">There's multiple benefits through the Internet
of Things. Whether it be more efficiency inside of a factory, 
so predictive maintenance is a very simple use case that we use 
in factories that allow us to determine if a machine is going 
down sooner than it actually does go down and that'll prevent 
the down time for the factory, right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Ms. Vachani">This is a fundamental analytics that has changed how 
efficient our factories can be. Let's think of retail where one 
of the number-one determinations of success or how they lose 
customers is because the item you're looking for isn't there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. Vachani">So you go in for a pair of jeans, you don't have your size, 
you leave, you forget. That's important that we understand what 
people are looking for and that we have the inventory ready for 
them and that we understand what inventory you have. Inventory 
loss is a major loss for our retail businesses, especially 
brick and mortar businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Ms. Vachani">And then I would also look at cities and how cities are 
using technologies to do gunshot detection at intersections or 
monitoring the environment as far as air quality is concerned. 
And that data enables us to decide if the changes we are 
making--let's say we have in India electric rickshaws. Are they 
actually having an impact on our air quality and to make wise 
decisions based on data rather than hypotheses that we are 
making things better?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Mrs. Walters. OK. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Mr. Day, as we continue to advance toward an increasingly 
connected world, some have expressed concerns with protecting 
consumer information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. Vachani">These are vitally important concerns, yet we also must 
acknowledge that Internet of Things devices in a connected 
world provide substantial societal benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    Can you speak to how we can protect consumer information 
without losing the upside to a more connected world?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Day">I think it's obvious that the Chamber believes
that consumers deserve to have their personal data respected by 
the companies and it's important that we are mindful of that, 
going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Day">I think the other thing that I mentioned in my opening 
statement was that technology is not a single all-powerful 
industry and that I think it's important that this is a part of 
every industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Day">And when we are looking at the Internet of Things, I think 
it's something that we need to be mindful of but not directly 
linking the privacy issue to this legislation, as we go 
forward. But I think it is something, as we've all testified 
to, that it's important and we need to be considering what data 
means now, because data is being created in massive amounts and 
how that is handles is truly important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Day">And I think that's one of the areas where the Chamber is 
doing a lot of work and you will be hearing more from us on 
some of the importance of privacy principles, going forward, as 
a result of some of the discussions that we've been hearing in 
Washington lately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Day">Mrs. Walters. OK. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Day">Ms. Vachani, as you may know, this committee is very 
focused on the advancement of self-driving cars. Your testimony 
discusses the enormous benefit of increased mobility that 
autonomous vehicles will provide for aging and disabled 
populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Day">    Can you expand on this and discuss the role Internet of 
Things plays?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Autonomous vehicles, what the connection back
to an aging population is if you don't have public 
transportation for someone to get to the hospital or someone to 
get to where they want to go for a social benefit, let's say, 
and having more independence for our elderly population, a 
vehicle that is autonomous is safer for them to get from point 
A to point B and that enables them the flexibility and the 
independence that we want for our elderly population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Mrs. Walters. OK. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    And I am out of time. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Latta">Thank you very much. The gentlelady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Latta">And the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Michigan 
for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Latta">Mrs. Dingell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to Ranking 
Member Schakowsky for the leadership on this issue and to 
everybody for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Latta">I think that it's safe to say that we do have agreement on 
both sides of the aisle about the significant and revolutionary 
things that the Internet of Things is bringing to industry and 
consumers, and you all have certainly talked today about 
examples where it's already making a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Latta">But I continue to have a reservation that's been expressed 
by a number of other of my colleagues. As we compare the rise 
of IoT to the development of the internet that the internet 
thrived because of the light regulatory touch used and I think 
we are not paying enough attention to security and privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Latta">So I have to already say to you, Mr. Day, before I even ask 
you my questions to say that we should deal with privacy is not 
something that I am going to be comfortable with because I 
think that the technology--that the Facebook hearings have 
showed people had no idea of the amount of data that was being 
tracked and there isn't security on how that information is 
being used and we are not protecting even the privacy of an 
individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Latta">So I won't go off on that right now. But I had to respond 
to that comment. But I would like to ask a few questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Latta">    Ms. Richardson, in a market that's rapidly evolving, how 
have you seen companies balancing getting to the market first 
with protecting security?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Yes. We often see that privacy and security
is what fall short here, and a lot of these controls that are 
considered to be best practices are not hard from a technical 
matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Ms. Richardson">For example, a couple of years ago the BitTag--the 
broadband internet technical advisory group--put out a report 
with a list of maybe 5 to 10 things that were of utmost 
priority like encryption, right, making sure that the data 
collected was protected in transit in storage, avoiding hard-
coded passwords--this is one of the problems with the Mirai 
botnet, right. All of those cameras were accessible with the 
same password the hackers knew and they were able to get all 
these cameras.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Ms. Richardson">And if you meet some of these baseline best practices 
you're going to lift all boats, right. It's not going to solve 
every problem but it will certainly give us herd immunity as 
users of all these different devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Mrs. Dingell. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    Ms. Vachani, on the consumer side, have you seen privacy 
being designed into these products before they're hitting the 
market?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Yes. Actually, I will tell you and hope to
give you confidence that the security and privacy is utmost 
imperative when we are designing a solution--where we store 
data, how that data is transmitted, and we look at that as a 
fundamental premise as we are integrating these solutions, and 
we make decisions that are different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Ms. Vachani">We may store data locally because it makes it easier for us 
to be able to protect it. And so these criterias are absolutely 
in the solutions that we create and we--if you look at the 
solution that we had with regards to the health care 
monitoring, that's FDA approved and we follow all HIPAA laws, 
right. We enable our silicon so that our solution developers 
are able to follow HIPAA laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Mrs. Dingell. So not to be sarcastic, but as someone who 
has been hacked at least 15 times, every one of the major ones, 
and that's one of the difficulties is once that hack occurs--
once that data is obtained by somebody you can't put the genie 
back into the bottle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Mr. Day, I know your organization is concerned and 
apprehensive about regulations, as you expressed it. But one of 
my concerns is going to build right on what I just said--that 
down the road there will be these massive data breaches that we 
keep seeing or an abuse of privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Ms. Vachani">We'll convene a hearing. The witnesses will be questioned. 
Everybody will express outrage and concern, but the damage will 
have already been done, which was one on Facebook, which I just 
talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    Do you think it would be helpful to develop some clear 
rules of the road for companies now so we can try to mitigate 
this for the future?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Day">Thank you, Congresswoman, for the question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Day">And to answer you directly, yes, I firmly believe that and 
I think I would like to suggest that the offer is extended to 
work with you and your office on these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Day">In fact, the Chamber is currently going through a process 
right now on developing privacy principles that we will be 
working with Congress on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Day">And so I think probably earlier than later, to be engaging 
with you and your staff would be a great opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Day">I will tell you, again, that I firmly believe consumers 
deserve to have their personal data respected by companies that 
they're working with and I think that it's critical though that 
we strike that proper regulatory balance that protects 
consumers while promoting the technology that we all use every 
day and appreciate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Day">Mrs. Dingell. That's one of the biggest challenges in this 
committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Day">    I know I am out of time, Mr. Chairman, but it would be 
interesting for the record to get what principles they are 
coalescing around that you mentioned earlier in your testimony. 
I think it would be useful for all of us.

    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Latta">Thank you very much. The gentlelady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Latta">    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Guthrie</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">Thank you very much. It's great to be here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for having all the witnesses 
here. We've had some really interesting hearings in this space. 
The other day we did quantum computing, which I am still trying 
to figure out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">The guy said, well, I will make it simple for you--it's 
like flipping a coin and getting heads or tails is normal. In 
the quantum world you can flip a coin and get heads and tails 
at the same time. So that really made it simple for me. I've 
been thinking about that all weekend, trying to figure out what 
he actually meant. That's how he explained it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">But it is good that we are getting to a work product out of 
this so it's important. So that's what I want to focus on today 
and hopefully things I can understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">    So, Mr. Day, can you briefly explain while voluntary 
industry-led, globally recognized, and consensus-based 
processes for Internet of Things standards are so critical and 
could you name some examples of industry-led efforts that are 
currently taking place?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Day">So with this legislation is, as I testified to, I
think is an important first step and I think by having certain 
standards set and compiling information again by all industries 
and sectors will benefit all of us and that I think the 
benefits both to consumers, to industrial, and to government 
are very clear and, you know, it's everything from keeping a 
global competitive lead on other countries and that this 
country needs to continue to be the leader in technology and, 
again, I think, it's a great attribution to what the 
subcommittee and full committee has done on a bipartisan basis 
on self-driving cars to the health care applications that we've 
discussed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Day">    So there's a whole host and wide variety of areas where 
this is a true benefit and, again, fully support the draft 
legislation and the DIGIT Act as well. We have come out in 
support of that early on and hope to work with the committee, 
going forward, on passing the legislation.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Guthrie</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"> Thanks. And so, Ms. Richardson, why do you
believe compiling a list of industry standard-setting efforts 
under the SMART IoT Act will be a critical part of helping to 
inform future congressional action?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Yes, and we would go one step further to
say the list should also come with an estimation of whether the 
standards are being estimated. We don't want you to come back 
or get a report back that has a thousand standards listed 
because the next question is going to be well, are these being 
implemented, right--who's using these and are they working. 
That's the logical question and I think that's what Congress, 
advocates, industry is dancing around at this moment--is that 
process working?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    So I would recommend to include that analysis top and that 
would help you figure out where you really want to focus your 
efforts, going forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Guthrie</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">OK. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">And Ms. Vachani, we've heard in the past hearings about the 
critical need for security and good cyber hygiene both in 
production lines for IoT devices and within the Federal 
Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">    What are you doing at Intel to safeguard IoT devices and 
networks from hacking vulnerabilities and what can small to 
mid-size businesses do to take meaningful steps to address data 
security concerns?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Ms. Vachani">So if I look at Intel's contribution here, our
security is fundamentally written into the silicon development. 
So it's in hardware, its software. It's in the connectivity. So 
we think of silicon across the board and we think of security 
across the board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Ms. Vachani">One of the areas that you talked about was software 
defined, right. As security standards start to change or as we 
learn more can we reprogram our devices--can we update those? 
And so that's included in our assumptions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Ms. Vachani">So we enable the industry through not only hardware but 
software security to be able to implement the best known 
security that we know at this point in our space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    So absolutely paramount in what we do.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Guthrie</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">OK. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">    I know you mentioned earlier--and I had another hearing but 
I heard you mention earlier--scale. But could you name what you 
see as other potential impediments to deployment of IoT and 
what we should be aware of, going forward?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Well, we've talked quite a bit about standards
and one thing I want to make sure we make the point of is these 
standards are international, and so scale is just not within 
the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Ms. Vachani">I would like for us to be competitive internationally and 
having these standards that were global allows us to provide 
technology to other countries and export our great experience 
that we have here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    And so I believe the interoperability and enabling us to be 
competitive internationally and taking advantage of these 
international standards will be important for us to be 
successful.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Guthrie</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Guthrie"> Thank you, and thank you for your testimony. I
appreciate it. It's a little more understandable for someone 
like me. I asked the guy how could you flip a coin and get 
both.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> I have no idea.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Guthrie</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">He says, it's like putting it in a box and the
box is continually spinning and that really is the clue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">[Laughter.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">This is coming from a guy who's never solved the golf peg 
game at Cracker Barrel. So we'll figure it out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Guthrie">    Thanks a lot. I appreciate it, and I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Latta">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Latta">    The chair recognizes the gentlelady from California for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Matsui</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you
and the ranking member for having this hearing today and I want 
to thank the witnesses very much for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Ms. Matsui">I've discussed the potential block chain applications with 
the subcommittee before including its possibility to allow 
spectrum sharing as next-generation broadband networks are 
deployed. As you all know, block chain is a decentralized 
accounting technology that verifies transactions through a 
shared ledger system. When a transaction and a block chain is 
completed, that transaction is verified against a ledger stored 
on each computer in the network. The IoT and connected devices 
will facilitate a significant expansion of data transactions 
likely between multiple different networks and block chain 
could be used to verify and secure these transactions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Ms. Matsui">    Is there an opportunity for this legislation to more 
precisely explore how new technologies could facilitate the 
secure advancement of internet-connected devices? And anyone on 
the panel can answer that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Day">I will take a first attempt at answering that
question. And I agree with you--I think block chain is 
certainly an area where IoT will offer a lot of benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Day">At the Chamber we are just now beginning to work on our 
FinTech work and we are calling on members to help us 
understand the benefits. And so I think there are a number of 
ways that we should be looking at this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Day">I think the legislation as drafted, though, is the correct 
step. It allows for technologies like block chain and others to 
progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Day">    But as we are understanding the technology and the benefits 
thereof we can continue to work with you and other members of 
Congress on implementing certain regulations as appropriate 
facing the technology.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Matsui</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Ms. Matsui"> Anyone else?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Block chain is absolutely a technology that
Intel is looking at and one that can be used in IoT 
applications, so a really good connection there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    I think, though, one of the points that you made when you 
kicked off as you're looking 5 to 10 years out and you have the 
benefit of doing so, and so today it's block chain and tomorrow 
it could be something even more revolutionary and that's why 
it's important that we consider this not from a very 
technology-specific standpoint but you're more holistically as 
to what's necessary for us to be successful, regardless of the 
implementation technology.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Matsui</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Ms. Matsui">OK. Narrow band IoT networks are particularly
useful for long-range low-power applications. Specifically, 
these networks improve capacity, spectrum efficiency, and power 
consumption levels of user devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Narrow band IoT networks have potential both nationwide and 
particularly for rural and indoor coverage. These networks can 
coexist with commercial mobile networks and their propagation 
characteristics could provide better range and reduce coverage 
costs for consumers in both rural areas and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Ms. Matsui">    Anyone on the panel--what role do narrow band networks have 
in the IoT ecosystem from a spectrum efficiency cost and 
deployment perspective?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Ms. Vachani">I think narrow band is going to help with--
there are several elements in narrow band that makes IoT 
applications you have already referred to--it's lower cost, 
lower power, and a longer--which enables longer battery life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Ms. Vachani">So think about we currently have an application where we 
are sensing the environment for a case of strawberries, right. 
We want to make sure the humidity is right. We want to make 
sure the temperature is right. Narrow band allows for that 
connectivity--the continuous connectivity while extending the 
battery life and not increasing the cost of something that we'd 
want to do with a pack of strawberries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Also understand that when you move to the world of 5G, now 
all of this comes together. So now we have a narrow band 
spectrum. 5G includes all of those spectrums--will enable us to 
be able to pull this together as a complete solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    It revolutionizes how we think of connectivity and our 
spectrums because narrow band is included as well as low 
latency as well as high bandwidth.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Matsui</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Ms. Matsui">OK. Great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Anyone else want to comment on that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Ms. Matsui">OK. Spectrum is the invisible infrastructure and 
Congressman Guthrie and I are working on this. It underpins our 
communications infrastructure and adequate supply is necessary 
to realize the potential on next-generation broadband networks 
and the IoT. Specifically, agencies should have access to funds 
made available for engineering research that could lead to the 
repurposing of spectrum for commercial use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Ms. Matsui">    What role will next-generation networks play in our IoT 
strategy and how would delivering more spectrum to commercial 
users help?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Ms. Vachani">I would summarize it into one word, which is
interoperability. If you think about a wider spectrum analysis, 
so 5G enables low spectrum as well as low latency high 
bandwidth, and now you have that on one network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    And so you're able to include all of those. Remember I said 
that it's not very much a vertical solution. We have all kinds 
of pieces that are coming together into an IoT solution, which 
can vary in spectrum and once we have a solution that 
encompasses all those spectrums now it makes deployments easier 
for our customers, thus enabling scale, which we----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Matsui</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Ms. Matsui"> OK. I've run out of time, so thank you very
much.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Matsui</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Ms. Matsui"> Yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Latta"> Thank you very much. The gentlelady's time has
expired and the chair now recognizes the gentleman from West 
Virginia for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McKinley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. McKinley">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize to
the panel--that we've got a hearing going on downstairs so we 
are back and forth in between them, and perhaps I've missed 
some of your testimony that targeted what my questions were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. McKinley">But I want to begin with saying that I am going to start by 
assuming you have all read Case's book, ``The Third Wave.'' Two 
out of three have. I was fascinated with that book--that the 
possibilities of where we might go long term, it was mentioned 
about the refrigerator that could speak to you, your clothing 
could tell you how your--whether your wellness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. McKinley">Those were all in the long terms. I am somewhat interested 
in the short term, however, and that is, is there anyone--can 
you tell me from the three experiences we have up here, is 
there something in the pipeline of the IoT that might indicate 
the propensity of an area to have a problem with opioid abuse?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. McKinley">I know some people have--or they've talked about doing it, 
to be able to develop where that might be. But is there anyone 
that you know of that's actually got something close to 
fruition that we could do this? Because we are getting, as we 
all know, nationally getting hit pretty hard with this and we 
don't know where the next problem is going to crop up until 
after. We are reacting rather than being proactive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. McKinley">    So I am curious to see with the Internet of Things in a 
short term is there someone developing software that might be 
able to identify where the next problem could crop up?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Yes. Actually, Intel is working exactly on
that problem, concerning the monitoring of medicine and the 
ability to know exactly where that medicine is going--is it 
going to the right person, monitoring how many tablets are 
there and knowing exactly who's taking those--having some 
facial detection--who's picking up those tablets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    And so absolutely. I believe that you have made a very 
relevant connection, and thank you for that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McKinley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. McKinley"> What's the time--do you have a sense of----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Ms. Vachani">We are seeing an implementation immediately,
and it's an evolution over time. We are not going to have 
facial detection immediately at all of our pharmacies but it'd 
be interesting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. Vachani">It's an evolution over time but we are seeing 
implementations right away in which we can start to monitor 
medicine better. It's just a matter of is it getting to the 
right person, how many, and are the right people taking it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    So you think about in the opiate but you can also think 
about it with elderly patients as well, right, or making sure 
they are taking their medicines on time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McKinley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. McKinley">That may be a worry but, again, the
propensity, this community may be hit hard next. That's what I 
am looking for as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. McKinley">    The fact that there could be some software that says the 
drugs--20 million pills are going to one pharmacy, that ought 
to trigger something.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McKinley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. McKinley">But in the meantime, are there socioeconomic
barriers that we need to break down?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. McKinley">    So, Mr. Day, you look like you were going to contribute to 
this conversation.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Day">So yes, at the Chamber, Congressman, we have been
looking at economic situations across the country and that 
impact of joblessness and how communities have been impacted by 
this plight and looking at ways that we can start to examine 
the linkage between the two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Day">    And I think to the point on monitoring pill bottles and 
knowing times of when they're taken and monitoring who are 
getting their prescriptions, et cetera, those are things that 
are happening now but there is a lot more to be done.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McKinley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. McKinley">Well, if I could on that, because you touched
on something I am kind of sensitive to is the socioeconomic--
household income, education level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. McKinley">Some will use that as the excuse for why West Virginia is 
leading the Nation in opioid overdose but number two, until 
last year, was New Hampshire, and New Hampshire has polar 
opposites on that. It has one of the highest household income. 
It has the highest education level, and on and on and on, with 
good socioeconomics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. McKinley">    So I think there's something separating the two between us. 
So I am just curious if someone's developing something more 
sophisticated than just going on socioeconomics.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Day"> I am not personally aware, to be honest with you.
But I think it would be an opportunity for us to work together 
as we continue our work with the Chamber and working with our 
member companies on various technologies, and I would be happy 
to do that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McKinley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. McKinley"> I would like to pursue that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> I would like to offer that we can follow up
with the details of the solution I just.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McKinley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. McKinley"> If you could, back to my office, I would
appreciate that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> I would love to do that, if I could help.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McKinley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. McKinley">All of you. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. McKinley">    I yield back my time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Latta">Thank you very much. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Latta">The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Vermont, and I 
want to thank him for all of his hard work not only in this 
Congress but in the last Congress, working on IoT issues with 
me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Latta">    So thank you very much. The gentleman is recognized for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Welch">Thank you, and thank you as well, Mr. Latta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Welch">I want to focus a little bit on rural America--just to have 
each of you say what it is we need to do in rural America if we 
are going to have any opportunity to yield the benefits of IoT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Welch">    I will start with you, Mr. Day.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Day">So I think one of the most important things, and
you mentioned it earlier, Congressman, is the fact that 
broadband is not in every household in the country and that's 
first and foremost, I think, for a lot of reasons, I think, for 
being able to compete globally, being able to be connected and 
be able to have a business based upon the internet is critical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Day">    And so I think for rural America--and I applaud your 
efforts. That's first and foremost.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Welch"> Thanks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Ms. Richardson">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Well, I think the whole point of having
standards and what your bill is discussing is to shift the 
responsibility for security to the people who can best address 
it, right--the manufacturers, the operators--and I think this 
is where low-tech users benefit most from this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    And so to the extent that your rural users are rapidly 
deploying new technology that they're not familiar with they 
will certainly benefit from better security standards.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Welch"> Thanks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Ms. Vachani">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Absolutely. I absolutely applaud the benefit
to get broadband into rural America but understand that we can 
do to implement technology today whether it be a cellular 
signal, right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    I will give you the example of my parents, who still live 
in the same house that I grew up in and won't leave no matter 
what I do at this point. Having some type of monitoring, making 
sure they're getting up in the morning and that they're--oh, 
somebody's opened the refrigerator, that she's eating--there's 
elements of that that I think is important that we can do today 
for rural America with the connectivity that we have and we 
don't have to limit ourselves to that deployment.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Welch">OK. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Welch">The other broad question--I just want to go down the 
panel--is about privacy and security. You have talked a little 
bit about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Welch">    But is there a role that you believe the Congress has to 
play in ensuring an individual's personal data is protected and 
is it your view that an individual has to have the control over 
how his or her data is being used--something we asked Mr. 
Zuckerberg when he was here a while ago?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Day"> Well, again, I think to emphasize the point that
consumers have and deserve the right to have their personal 
data respected by all.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Welch"> Let's go quickly because I have one more
question.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Day"> As we develop our principles at the Chamber, I
look forward to working with you on those details.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Welch"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Ms. Richardson"> We eventually need legislation. That's
going to be the only way out of this mess we are in.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> I think working together between government
and industry is essential to come up with the solutions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Welch"> But there has to be some role that Congress
plays. We can't be passive observers of what's going on.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Day"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Welch">Do you agree with that? Thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Welch">Let me ask you, Ms. Vachani--I know Intel has been a leader 
in IoT advancement and I know you have had a high position as a 
thought leader in that space for years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Welch">    So I want to follow up your testimony and ask if you can 
expand your suggestions as to the definition that we should use 
in his bill and why it's so important to get that definition 
right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Ms. Vachani">One of the number-one challenges of scale, and
it sounds very simple, is terminology. We talk past each other 
when we are having--and I see us doing it in the industry, and 
so we are in this space. We live it and breathe it. But we use 
different words to represent different things and we are 
talking past each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    So one of the fundamental things I've had to do within my 
organization, within my company as well as outside, is to start 
to get on the same language and that's one of the things we are 
asking for this as well is just to get on the same language so 
we know when we are speaking to each other what we are 
referring to.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Welch">OK. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Welch">I thank the panel. Very helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Welch">And I yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Welch">Mr. Costello [presiding]. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Welch">    The gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Mullin, is recognizes for 
5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Mullin">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank our panel
for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Mullin">    I have just a few questions, and Ms. Vachani--is that how 
you pronounce it? I appreciate you being here and I just, for 
the help of myself and you might have already been asked this 
question, but as you have heard we were running back and forth 
between committees.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> No problem.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Mullin"> Are there barriers or what are the barriers
that's keeping the U.S. from leading in the IoT?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Ms. Vachani">I answered this question of scale but I will
answer this question slightly differently, to add to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Ms. Vachani">What I find is, if you look at the city level there's quite 
a bit of innovation going on. I talked about San Diego and what 
San Diego is doing within their lights in California. We talked 
about New York and the building management that's happening in 
New York. At the city level, I believe that that implementation 
is taken seriously and there's a lot of innovation happening. 
But where I think we can make a difference is scale across the 
city at a nationwide--right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    So these pockets of innovation, how we can reuse, how can 
we learn, and how can we deploy it more worldwide, more United 
States wide. That's slightly different than what I see in other 
countries where we are looking at it more nationally. India, 
China are looking at it more nationally, and so you'd get the 
benefit of the individual innovations that are happening at a 
national level.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Mullin"> Well, I will use my district, for example, even
my personal house. We don't even have slow dial up. The best we 
can do is 3G through our phone, and 50 percent of my district 
has little to no access to the internet.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Mullin">And so we talk about metropolitan areas. But
you're right, we are leaving out the rural pockets, which 
mileage-wise is the vast majority of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Mullin">    Are the other countries, as you alluded to, are they doing 
a better job at that and then--and if so, what are they doing 
that we are not?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Ms. Vachani">So large parts of India and large parts of
China don't have connectivity either, right, and so that isn't 
an isolated and probably more of an issue there than it is even 
here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Ms. Vachani">They are looking at how to deploy faster so that these 
rural areas do have connectivities--that's one area we could 
look further at--as well as leveraging the technology that is 
available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    So going into a factory in another country--they have 
connectivity, no broadband, but they have some level of 3G--we 
are able to leverage that to at least start to get some 
automation within the factory. So, again, taking advantage of 
the connectivity that we do have a maximizing that, at the same 
time deploying more robust connectivity.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Mullin">So what role can Congress play then? How can we
encourage companies or industry to look out farther than just 
in metropolitan areas?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Mullin">    We did this with electricity. We did this with phone 
service. This is a new technology that's keeping us from 
connecting. So what is that we can do? What can Congress do, to 
put in place, to help encourage that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> I think we can look at this not in the siloes
that we do today. You have the benefit of a holistic view, not 
just in each department but as a holistic view how we deploy 
this.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Mullin"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Ms. Vachani"> That's the benefit, and then, frankly
speaking, how do we invest so that we start to deploy this 
technology more robustly--is there an investment strategy to 
that as well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Mullin">Thank you so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Mullin">    Switching gears, Ms. Richardson, how difficult is it to 
secure an IoT device?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Ms. Richardson"> I think that would depend on the device
itself and how it's connected to the internet. I think there 
are a handful of best practices that we see across different 
sectors and industries, things like encryption, strong password 
and other authentication models, update ability.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Mullin"> Have certain security measures been put in
place since the 2014 Target breach, especially the Wanna Cry 
ransom?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Ms. Richardson"> There's nothing mandatory and I think these
sorts of practices that----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Mullin"> Should there be?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. Richardson">That's a hard question and I am realistic
about mandatory requirements on the private sector. I don't 
think we are there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    I think, though, the government should explore its own 
purchasing power. Right now, the Trump administration and some 
of the agencies are writing privacy and security guidelines in 
preparation for a big level up in purchase of IT modernization 
and that would be one way that you could influence the market 
without forcing anybody to do anything specific.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mullin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Mullin"> Thank you, and I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costello</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Costello">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Costello">    The gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Clarke, is recognize for 
5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Clarke</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Ms. Clarke">I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our
ranking member, Ms. Schakowsky. I would like to also thank our 
panel for their expert testimony here this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Ms. Clarke">As you may be aware, earlier this year I launched the 
congressional Smart Cities Caucus and I would add Smart 
Communities with Rep. Darrell Issa. I was inspired to start the 
Smart Cities Caucus from my personal interactions with seeing 
the amazing build-out first hand in New York City. The Smart 
Cities Caucus serves as a bipartisan group of members dedicated 
to bringing American communities into the 21st century through 
innovation and technological change. Embracing smart technology 
will make our communities more sustainable, resilient, 
efficient, liveable, and competitive in a world in which 
technology is constantly advancing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Ms. Clarke">    So I would like to ask a couple of questions, first to you, 
Act considering the interplay of the Smart Cities and which 
Federal agencies should play an active role in sort of 
harnessing what we know already?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Richardson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Ms. Richardson">Well, you have some of the work horses of
the cybersecurity world in Commerce, right, so that is a 
benefit that you have with NIST, NTIA, and other places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Ms. Richardson">I think when you look at the smart cities you have a couple 
of different types of devices. You have really basic ones that 
don't collect personal information, they're low broadband 
information sharers, right, and they're just water pressure, 
how many cars passed through here, things like that, that are 
going to be less risky from both a security and privacy 
standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Ms. Richardson">    I hope that your report will highlight some of the more 
high-risk things that are either facial recognition, location 
tracking, right. That's the result of many of these things like 
license plate readers or toll roads and how those are being 
deployed by the government.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Clarke</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Ms. Clarke"> Ms. Vachani, Intel IoT portfolio includes smart
cities, smart buildings, and smart video. What are your 
recommendations and why are smart cities so important to 
Intel's IoT portfolio?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Essentially, the Smart Cities enables us to
create an infrastructure for safer cities as well as enabling 
our cities to do better planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Ms. Vachani">If you look at the GE solution that we deployed on smart 
cities, it does stuff like gunshot detection, right. It's 
determining if there was a shot and, if so, what we do about 
it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Ms. Vachani">It looks at air quality, right, and so this enables us to 
take advantage of the technology we've built for many other 
industries. Smart Cities is a culmination of many other 
technologies we've built maybe for a factory or for a home but 
we are able to leverage that to improve not only our 
environment as well as our cities and its planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    So we see that there's a leverage of our technology across 
the board and that Smart Cities can take advantage of it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Clarke</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Ms. Clarke"> And would you just envision for some of my
colleagues who are in rural communities how we can look at that 
ecosystem that is being developed in more densely populated 
areas and what can be taken from that for more sprawling 
communities in terms of connecting them in smart ways?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Vachani</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Ms. Vachani">Yes, and I will go back to the GE solution.
The GE solution takes advantage of a light pole. So that's what 
we are building on top of. It already has electricity. It 
already has power. You take advantage of that power to connect 
up sensors and then it uses a 3G connection that goes back up 
into a data center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Ms. Vachani">    So, again, we are able to take advantage of infrastructure 
that's already there and built in as best as possible.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Clarke</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Ms. Clarke">Very well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Ms. Clarke">    And, Mr. Day, anything that you'd like to add in this?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Day</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Day">Absolutely, and I want to applaud you on your
efforts with Congressman Issa with co-chairing that caucus. 
It's very important, and C-TEC has joined a couple of events 
and we look forward to continuing to work with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Day">But I think when you look at a city, for example, 20 
percent of a given city in the United States is dedicated 
during the work day to parking, and I think one of the things 
that C 09TEC has been taking as a priority and working with you 
and others on is the fact that autonomous vehicles will impact 
both that issue as well as the environment and other issues and 
I think it, in the end, will prove to be very beneficial for a 
lot of reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Day">    And so smart city activities are critical and what we are 
trying to do and be creative in our thinking and our approach 
and how IoT plays in that is paramount and a top priority of 
ours, going forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Clarke</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Ms. Clarke"> Well, thank you very much for your response
today, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costello</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Costello">Gentlewoman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Costello">Seeing there are no further members wishing to ask 
questions, I would like to thank all of our witnesses for being 
here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Costello">Before we conclude, I would like to include the following 
documents to be submitted for the record by unanimous consent: 
a letter from the Consumer Technology Association, a letter 
from CTIA, and a letter from EPIC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Costello">[The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Costello">Pursuant to committee rules, I remind members that they 
have 10 business days to submit additional questions for the 
record and I ask that witnesses submit their response within 10 
business days upon receipt of the questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Costello">Without objection, the subcommittee is adjourned. Have a 
good day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Costello">[Whereupon, at 11:54 a.m., the committee was adjourned.]</paragraph>
