    <Doc-title>DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION, AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR 2018</Doc-title>
    <paragraph paraId="0" speaker="">morning and welcome to this year's first subcommittee hearing. 
Today we welcome our distinguished colleagues to testify on 
their priorities for the Departments of Transportation, and 
Housing and Urban Development for both fiscal years 2017 and 
2018.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="">Now, under our full committee chairman, Mr. Frelinghuysen, 
we have brought back Member hearing days in order to give every 
Member the opportunity to express their priorities and concerns 
to this committee. We want every Member involved in the 
appropriations process. So I sincerely thank you for 
participating. Your views are crucial. They are important for 
us to begin this new appropriations season, and we look forward 
to hearing your testimony. It will help us put together a 
better bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="">Mr. Chairman, I am glad that you are here. I know you are 
chairing your committee probably in the next few hours, Mr. 
Joyce has been recently named vice chairman of this 
subcommittee, and so we want to congratulate him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="">Now, with that, let me recognize the ranking member of this 
subcommittee, the gentleman from North Carolina, who I have 
enjoyed working with. And as ranking member, he has become an 
integral part of the team to make sure that we come up with a 
good bill, and that is obviously Mr. Price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="">    You are recognized, Mr. Price.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Price</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Price">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate those
words and want to reciprocate them. We have a good cooperative 
pattern of work established here, and I anticipate that we are 
going to have some challenges this year with some of the budget 
numbers we are hearing about, but we have to do our best, as 
always, on behalf of our institution and our power of the purse 
and the kind of priorities, a lot of which we are going the 
hear about today. We have got to do our very, very best to 
write an inclusive and robust bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Price">So I agree with you that it is a good way to start, to hear 
from our Members, and I commend Chairman Frelinghuysen for 
initiating this across all the subcommittees and look forward 
to today's testimony. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Price">Mr. Diaz-Balart. Thank you, Mr. Price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Price">And so we will begin with the gentlelady from American 
Samoa, Mrs. Radewagen. I will remind all of our colleagues who 
come in front of us that we have a very tight schedule. So we 
are going to have to stick to the 5-minute rule for testifying. 
Obviously, your written remarks will be included in the record. 
And so please do not forget to turn on your microphone, if you 
would.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Price">And, with that, ma'am, you are recognized. Thank you for 
being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Price">----------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Price">Thursday, March 9, 2017.
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN RADEWAGEN, A DELEGATE IN CONGRESS FROM THE</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Price">Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Chairman Diaz-Balart and Ranking 
Member Price and members of the subcommittee. I very much 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to the subcommittee 
regarding some of the infrastructure needs in American Samoa. 
As you know, American Samoa lies in the middle of the Pacific 
Ocean south of the Equator. We the most remote U.S. Territory 
or State, and our infrastructure needs reflect that gulf of 
distance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Price">Currently, any air traffic that flies into or out of 
American Samoa or even between the islands in my home district 
must do so under the air traffic authority of Independent Samoa 
due to the lack of an air traffic control tower in the 
territory. This includes the codel that was just there the week 
before last.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Price">A proposed solution that would also be budget-neutral would 
be to allow the money that FAA is requiring the American Samoa 
government to pay them, $15 million over the next 10 years, 
$2.5 million annually. It seems the 2014 FAA land-use audit 
report found that of approximately 865 acres of land approved 
by the FAA in 1973 for airport use, 325 acres had been removed 
from the airport and used for other government--local 
government--purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Price">To rectify this issue, the ASG has agreed to pay FAA $2.5 
million a year for a 10-year period in exchange for FAA 
approval of a land-use change authorizing an interdepartmental 
change in jurisdiction for the 325 acres rather than a release 
for the disposal of airport property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Price">My proposal would be to allow the FAA to repatriate these 
funds back to the ASG for the specific purpose of building an 
airport tower at Pago Pago International Airport, as well as 
other improvements to the airport that are desperately needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Price">American Samoa is also suffering from dangerous roads and 
other traffic infrastructure safety issues that must be 
addressed soon. Because our small islands, which are roughly 
the same size as Washington, D.C., are hit with extremely 
powerful hurricanes every year, the infrastructure is in 
constant need of repair. A lack of sufficient funding in the 
past has caused many of the much needed repairs to go undone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Price">To rectify this issue and improve the safety of the roads 
in American Samoa and the other territories, I am requesting 
that the subcommittee please consider a significant increase to 
the territorial highways account authorized through the FAST 
Act. As it stands, there is no formula for which these funds 
are distributed and are left in the hands of administration 
officials. This policy has not benefitted American Samoa, and I 
also request there be a study of how the funds in this account 
might be more fairly spread out among the territories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Price">While I have only begun to touch on the many infrastructure 
needs in my home district, I wanted to take this limited time 
to highlight some of the most significant, and I look forward 
to working with the subcommittee in any way that I can to make 
sure that the people of American Samoa are being afforded the 
same resources as their counterparts in the States and other 
territories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Price">So thank you again, Chairman Diaz-Balart and Ranking Member 
Price, for your time and consideration of these requests. 
Should you have any questions, my staff is happy to work with 
your staff, my LD, and get you any information you may need. 
Thank you, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Price">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Price">Mr. Diaz-Balart. Let me thank the gentlewoman for again 
always being on top of the issues that are important to 
American Samoa, and I look forward to continuing to work with 
you. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Price">Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Price">Mr. Diaz-Balart. Mr. Bridenstine, thank you for being here, 
sir. You have the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Price">----------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Price">                                           Thursday, March 9, 2017.
HON. JIM BRIDENSTINE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridenstine</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">It is my honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">Thank you, Chairman Diaz-Balart, Ranking Member Price, Mr. 
Culberson, and Mr. Valadao. It is an honor to be here. I wanted 
to bring up something regarding infrastructure that a lot of 
people don't think about. We think about infrastructure. We 
think about roads and bridges, highways. We think about 
hospitals and schools. One piece of infrastructure that I think 
a lot of people don't consider is launch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">Space has transformed our way of life, the way we 
communicate, the way we navigate, the way we produce food, the 
way we produce energy, the way we provide security, do disaster 
relief, the way we do banking depends on GPS, for example. All 
of these capabilities require infrastructure, and as you look 
at how things are moving forward now, what used to be the 
domain of government, space, is now the domain of private 
operators and commercial operators, and when you think about 
things like remote sensing and imagery, the National Geospatial 
Intelligence Agency now uses a commercial space program in 
order to buy data from commercial providers for intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">When you think about communications, the Department of 
Defense, for its routine communications, uses about 80 percent 
commercial satellites, satellites that are launched to provide 
broadband from space, DIRECTV, the internet, are now being 
leased by the Department of Defense to provide communication 
capabilities for the warfighter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">When you talk about all different sorts of activities 
happening in space, commercial providers are now carrying a 
heavy load. What we need to do within the FAA Office of 
Commercial Space Transportation is make sure they are 
adequately funded for all of the upcoming launches. Everything 
I just described is historical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">When you think about the future, we are talking about 
hundreds, if not thousands, of satellites in low Earth orbit 
for remote sensing and imagery. When you think about 
communications, we are talking about actually many, many 
thousands of satellites. Boeing has a program. OneWeb has a 
program. SpaceX has a program. Each one of these low Earth 
orbit communication constellations constitutes multiple 
thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit. All are going to 
require launch, and these companies are contracting overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">In fact, last week, an American company building imagery 
satellites for purposes that the Department of Defense will 
use, they launched 96 American satellites on a foreign rocket, 
an Indian rocket, to be precise. OneWeb has contracts worth 
billions of dollars with the Russians because we don't have the 
capability here in the United States to deliver what they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">So the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which is 
within the FAA, in my estimation, needs to be fully and 
adequately funded just so that we can go forward with these new 
programs that are going to change the way we think about space. 
And, of course, where does that begin?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">The Office of Commercial Space Transportation within the 
FAA is the regulatory body. That is true. But they are also the 
body that is necessary to promote and facilitate commercial 
space industry. Right now, they are funded under a continuing 
resolution at a level that I believe is inadequate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">Last year, I came to this committee, and I requested $19.8 
million, which doesn't seem like a big number, but that was 
what was in the President's budget request, and what the 
appropriations process came to was an amount less, and you guys 
delivered, and I thank you for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">The challenge is, operating under a continuing resolution, 
that $19.8 million never materialized. So I would ask this 
year, in order to take care of all of these needs that are 
transforming the way we think about space and assert the way it 
is transforming the human condition on Earth, I am requesting 
that the Office of Commercial Space Transportation within the 
FAA, sometimes called FAA AST, be funded to the tune of $23 
million. With that, I will be open to any questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Yes, Mr. Price.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Price</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Price"> Let me just ask--I thank the gentleman for his
testimony. It is very convincing. Am I to conclude also that 
you will strongly back picking up the remaining 5 months of the 
current fiscal year so as to take advantage of the 
appropriations bill that would be included in an omnibus, as 
opposed to a yearlong CR?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridenstine</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine"> I will tell you, I don't like doing CRs. I
will also tell you that what we need to do is go through the 
appropriations process because, as I just described, the world 
has changed, and we need to make sure that what we are funding 
as a government reflects that change. I don't want to do a CR. 
If we do an omnibus and the priorities in there are 
appropriate, I am certainly willing to consider it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Price</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Price"> You are giving us a very good example of why a
serious appropriations bill with the detailed work that goes 
into it is preferable to automatic pilot.

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridenstine</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">When you think about NASA, this agency is
critical for NASA to accomplish its mission because NASA is 
using commercial to get back and forth to the International

not adequately funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Bridenstine">    It is not just NASA, though. It is also the Department of

HON. PETER A. DEFAZIO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeFazio</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for
this committee's interest in transportation and related issues. 
The one, I think, really important point to make at the 
beginning, I mean, I will talk about the larger needs, but 
because we are under a continuing resolution we are realizing 
$1.5 billion less in transportation spending this year, below 
the FAST Act levels which were already pretty anemic given our 
needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">If we fully fund the FAST Act we will barely tread water. 
We will not significantly defray any of our accumulated balance 
of, you know, backlog for maintenance, repair, and replacement. 
So I would urge the committee to do all they can as we move 
through whatever continuing resolution or actual appropriations 
to get us fully up to the FAST Act levels. That would benefit 
the Nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">I would like also to share, I know there has been some 
members of this committee who have expressed skepticism, but I 
would like to share some of my concerns about the privatization 
of the air traffic organization, the ATC. First and foremost, 
when they started this discussion I said, well, you know, you 
have a constitutional issue, and they blew me off and said, no, 
there is no problem. And subsequent analysis showed, yes, 
indeed, there is a constitutional issue recently upheld by the 
Supreme Court, which is you cannot delegate regulatory or rate-
making or taxation authority to a private entity which affects 
competitiveness without government involvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">So I did not bring my flow chart, but I developed a 
flowchart of how this new streamlined organization after we cut 
the FAA in half and move ATO over there, leave safety 
certification, everything else over here subject to annual 
appropriations, sequestration, government shutdowns. Over here 
we will have the new private entity which is supposed to self-
fund somehow, we are not sure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">And anything they propose, any route change, approach 
change, anything they approve, or certainly when they begin to 
want to assess fees against business aviation or general 
aviation or something else to pay for the system would have to 
then to go the Secretary's office, and the Secretary would then 
have an expanded office to review these proposals, you know, 
which seems to me not exactly a tremendous improvement. And if 
the Secretary disagrees, then they go to court. Great way to 
run a critical government function. So that's one major 
concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">I already mentioned the concern about us, you know, 
severing the agency in half. And, you know, there is a couple 
of other issues here. They are very critical and I have been 
critical over the years of procurement at the FAA, and some 
targeting reforms could benefit us there. Congress, in 1996, 
actually mandated procurement personnel reforms. Unfortunately, 
we did not exempt them from OMB and other political 
interference, and the reforms proposed by the administrator 
ended up being essentially the same system that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">So, yes, we could benefit from reforms there, and we could 
certainly authorize the FAA administrator to do those things 
without OMB review and other review and get some needed 
reforms. But if you talk to Dr. Dillingham of the GAO, who has 
been very critical of their past acquisitions, he says now they 
are on a good track. They are implementing NextGen at a good 
pace. It is benefiting the industry tremendously with new fuel-
efficient approaches, and they are rolling them out quite 
quickly now. So really, the whole complaint is about problems 
in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">Administrator Huerta has been doing a good job. And should 
we move over to a private corporation one can imagine the 
interruptions that might happen. In Canada, it was a very rocky 
8-year transition process. In England, actually, the government 
had to come back in and bail out the organization. Again, a 
rather rocky transition process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">And another point which should be of concern is that in 
both Great Britain and in Canada, the only two privatized ATC 
operations in the world. All the other countries have gone to 
government corporations, which could work here, also. They had 
to pay for the assets. Under this plan we would give away tens 
of billions of dollars of assets to this new private 
corporation. Should the private corporation fail, as it did in 
England, and we wanted to take it back, we would have to pay 
for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">So not only are we going to give away assets taxpayers have 
paid for, should this new experiment fail we are going to have 
to buy back the assets that we already paid for that we gave 
away. You know? An absolute absurdity. You know, and then there 
is a number of other issues regarding the magnitude of our 
system in comparison to others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">One other quick point. We are downstairs holding a hearing 
in Water about how we can deal with, you know, the backlog of 
maintenance in our ports which is causing lines of ships far, 
far out into the Pacific in L.A. and other parts of the 
country, raising the costs of imported goods. One way to deal 
with it is to actually spend the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
tax collections on harbor maintenance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">On a daily basis our 59 major harbors in the United States 
have 35 percent availability of authorized depths, 35 percent. 
We could deal with that if we merely appropriated every year 
the full amount of the tax that is collected. About $1.8 
billion a year is collected. We are spending, generally, half 
of that, and the rest of it goes into a theoretical account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">So not only could we begin by just fully appropriating the 
tax that comes in to deal with our maintenance backlog, we 
could also, hopefully, access and spend down the $9 billion 
that is in a theoretical account. But anyway, they talked about 
that downstairs a little bit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">But the other major focus downstairs is regulatory delays. 
Well, there is a new report. And I agree that there are 
sometimes over onerous regulations. But the principle cause of 
delays in projects, like the 140,000 bridges that need repair/
replacement of the Federal system, National Highway System, 
none of those are going to have to go through NEPA, or 
virtually none of them, if they are just replacements. But the 
money is not there. Plain and simple, the money is not there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">A major study done by AECOM, an independent firm, ordered 
by Treasury, has just come out and they looked at 40 major 
pending projects. And of the 40, 39 are challenged by 
inadequate funding; out of 40, 19 by increased capital costs, 
20 by local opposition, and 9 by regulatory issues. So, you 
know, money is at the heart of many of our infrastructure needs 
and problems in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">I know that you realize that on this committee and I 
recommend to you to do whatever you can to help increase needed 
funds. With that, I----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">[The statement of Mr. DeFazio follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. DeFazio">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Let me thank you, sir, for your very on-
point testimony. I would ask you, by the way, you talked about 
the flowchart, if you could bring it forward to the committee, 
we would love to submit that in the record.

dollars are directed. But thank you for being here.

HON. PAUL A. GOSAR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Thank you. I would like to first thank you,
Chairman Diaz-Balart, Ranking Member Price, and the committee 
for their work on the appropriations process under their 
jurisdiction. I am Paul Gosar and I represent the 4th 
Congressional District of Arizona, and I appreciate the 
opportunity to provide testimony supporting the specific 
appropriation priorities for Arizona and the country as a 
whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Gosar">First, I would like to applaud the committee's leadership 
and fiscal prudence in previous years that saved taxpayers 
money and protected the civil liberties of our constituents by 
preventing funds from going to the wasteful National Roadside 
Survey. As such, I request once again that the following 
language be retained in the next fiscal year Transportation 
Housing and Urban Development and related agencies 
appropriation that, quote, ``None of the funds made available 
by this act may be used to obligate or award funds for the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's National 
Roadside Survey,'' end of quote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Civil libertarians have raised legitimate concerns about 
the unconstitutionality of this program. Put simply, this 
survey looks like and acts like a police checkpoint and uses 
uniformed officers to pull cars over. Under the Fourth 
Amendment, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that a 
seizure occurs when a vehicle is stopped at a checkpoint. The 
question thus becomes whether such seizures are reasonable 
under the Fourth Amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Gosar">More importantly, the courts have allowed police 
checkpoints only when there is compelling public safety 
justification, such as stopping and arresting drunk drivers. 
However, under the circumstances of this program there is no 
public safety jurisdiction. The surveys do nothing to make our 
communities safer because drivers who ultimately refuse to 
participate are free to drive away, even if the driver is 
impaired. This results in a wasteful program that is invasive 
in the least, and at worst is an abuse of power and the 
violation of our civil liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Let me be clear. I strongly support efforts which are 
proven to have actually contributed to the decrease in impaired 
driving since the 1970s, such as local law enforcement 
operations, effective State and municipal policings, curb 
abuse, and worthwhile education efforts from organizations like 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or MADD, and similar groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Gosar">I thank the committee for their previous support of the 
civil liberty language and ask that it be included again in the 
next appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Another issue I would like to highlight for the committee's 
support is funding for congressionally designated high-priority 
corridors, or HPCs. These corridors are critical to the economy 
and security of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Last Congress I was proud to work with a bipartisan group 
of members and stakeholders to pass legislation which expanded 
the designation of the future Interstate 11 to extend from 
Mexico all the way to Northern Nevada. This interstate 
comprises two high-priority corridors: the CANAMEX Corridor and 
the Intermountain West Corridor. Since 1991, HBCs have been 
identified, updated, and funded in various transportation and 
appropriation bills. Although funding has been authorized, 
Congress has not recently appropriated funds specifically to 
these high-priority corridors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Gosar">The statutory definition of these corridors found in 1105 
of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act in 1991 
clearly identifies HPCs as appropriation projects of national 
importance and appropriate recipients of Federal funding. As 
this committee works to identify spending priorities that will 
address truly national, multistate transportation needs, I 
would encourage support of the high-priority corridors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Now, I understand the monumental task this committee faces 
each year to appropriate scarce taxpayer dollars to national 
priorities, and I appreciate their hard work. As you well know, 
the conversation cannot always be about finding more money. We 
must also look for ways to spend money more efficiently. In 
that regard, I look forward to working with this committee as 
well as other legislating and authorizing committees to 
institute reforms that will make our scarce transportation 
dollars go further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Gosar">The high-priority corridors identified as a future 
interstate present an amazing opportunity to build truly 21st 
century infrastructure. Real policy reforms, such as 
streamlining NEPA process and simplifying Davis-Bacon 
preventing wage requirements, can reduce the costs of these 
projects by millions. These future interstates could serve as 
the pilot programs to test and demonstrate innovative policy 
reforms that save taxpayer money and better meet the 
infrastructure development we need to make American great 
again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Gosar">I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you. I would 
like to thank all of the members for all that you do and the 
important work that goes forward from this committee. I yield 
back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Gosar">[The statement of Mr. Gosar follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Gosar">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Mr. Gosar, thank you for your testimony, 
and we have been working for a long time on a lot of these 
issues. I appreciate you bringing up some very important

very critical to my district's transportation infrastructure 
and its economy. I represent the Central Coast of California in 
the 20th Congressional District. And this winter, although we 
had been clamoring for it for quite a while, we got a lot of 
rain, a tremendous amount of rain, actually. And we were hit by 
a hard series of record-setting storms, storms that washed out 
major roads, highways. They isolate communities and they caused 
a tremendous amount of damage to individuals' homes and 
properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Panetta">And because of these storms the Pacific Coast Highway, in 
my biased opinion, one of the most beautiful stretches of road 
in the world, remains temporarily closed in many places. And 
near the southern part of that highway, the Town of Lucia, 
debris from landslides have covered lanes of traffic and closed 
an 8-mile section of that road. The boulders, as said on some 
of these slides, are so big, literally truck-sized boulders, 
have had to be removed by explosive ordnance. They are that 
big.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Panetta">In Big Sur, on the main route, Highway 1, there is a 
bridge, a 315-foot bridge, the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge, that has 
suffered irreparable structural damage and has had to be taken 
down and replaced. Now, it is not that iconic Bixby Creek 
Bridge that you all see when you hear about Big Sur, but it is 
just as important of a venue, literally in the main part of Big 
Sur. And as you can see from this picture that I am holding up 
the slide occurred right here underneath this pillar, took out 
that pillar, caused the bridge to sink. No one can go on this 
bridge, you cannot walk over it, you cannot drive cars over it; 
it has got to be taken down and completely replaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Panetta">The residents who are in between this bridge and the slides 
are isolated. There are families who are separated, there are 
children who cannot go to school, and there are businesses who 
are absolutely shut down at this point because no one is 
driving on this highway. And just last week I took part in an 
airlift where pallets of food, supplies, and actually fuel were 
brought to these individuals, to these families, by helicopter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Repair crews are on the ground and they are trying to 
repair this all-American highway as quick as possible. However, 
with more rain in the forecast for the coming days many are 
concerned whether this work will have a lasting impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Panetta">To live in Big Sur you have to be tough, you have to be 
hardy; there is no doubt about it because they deal with these 
types of extreme weather situations. In 1982, parts of Highway 
1 were closed for 13 months after a massive mudslide buried 
more than a quarter-mile of road. In the wake of this event 400 
people lost their jobs and the tourist industry lost nearly $34 
million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Now, hopefully, history will not repeat itself this year 
when it comes to the amount of losses. But if not replaced 
quickly, that bridge that you just saw, the fact that it won't 
be replaced could devastate the economies of the communities of 
that Big Sur area. They rely on that influx of tourism during 
the spring and summer months. It is times like these when 
communities like mine look to the Federal Highway 
Administration's Emergency Relief Program for assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Panetta">So I appreciate the $1 billion supplemental appropriation 
included in last year's continuing resolution and I encourage 
this committee to continue to provide the needed support for 
this critical program. Though we have not yet seen the 
President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2018, it is my hope 
that he demonstrates his commitment to improving our roads, 
bridges, airways, transit systems, and railroads through a 
strong Federal investment with the understanding of the 
importance of a strong Emergency Relief Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Your subcommittee, Mr. Chairman, has the opportunity to 
make infrastructure investments that are desperately needed in 
districts all across the Nation so that we can ensure a modern 
transportation system that sustains economic growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Thank you for the opportunity to advocate on behalf of 
these programs and thank you for the opportunity to be here to 
speak to you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Panetta">[The statement of Mr. Panetta follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Panetta">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. And let me thank the gentleman for his 
testimony, and for being here. I know I can speak for everybody 
in the subcommittee when we tell you that we look forward to 
working with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joyce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Joyce"> I am sorry, sir, I might have missed it. For the
bridge replacement, as I understood you, was there a cost 
estimate that you gave them?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Panetta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Panetta"> They have not come up with that. So I cannot
give you that now, but I can assure you that Caltrans, the 
California Transportation Authority, is working on that. I 
actually spoke with one of the heads of Caltrans, they said 
that they are obviously going to have to do an emergency 
replacement and that is going to take--what they are saying, 
which I was actually surprised, could be 6 months, which I 
think is pretty quick for that long a bridge, that big a 
bridge, in that area that is on such a dangerous cliff like 
that. But I think that that is, though, the time that he gave 
me. I will get back to you in regards to a number as to what it 
is going to cost.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joyce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Joyce">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Joyce">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. And I want to thank the members of this 
subcommittee because they have been very, very sensitive to 
making sure that we have that money there. And so, again, we 
look forward to working with you. Thank you.

    <speaker>Mr. Panetta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Thank you, sir.</paragraph>

    <speaker>Mr. Aguilar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Aguilar">It is a terrible place to live. Beautiful, you
know. Very tough vistas as well. So if there is a, you know, a 
trip that needs to be seen, I am sure Mr. Panetta would host 
you, Mr. Chairman, to take a look at the seriousness of this 
issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Aguilar">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Well, Mr. Aguilar, you are always willing 
to sacrifice greatly to help our colleague here.

a team player, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>

choked up and emotional. But thank you, thank you very much.

Jackson Lee. And thank you for your testimony and we know you 
have a number of different issues that you want to talk about. 
We might be able to give you a little bit more than the 5 
minutes. If somebody else shows up, then I will have to cut you 
off, and if not, we might be able to give you a little more. So 
we will have to play that by ear, ma'am, but you are 
recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Panetta">----------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Thursday, March 9, 2017.
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Ms. Jackson Lee. That may not be somewhat contentious, but 
I want to emphasize some points that I think are important. 
And, first of all, I want to thank this committee and thank the 
ranking member, thank the chairman. We admire and appreciate 
the bipartisan efforts of the Appropriations Committee as a 
whole, but, more importantly, Subcommittee on THUD, which I 
know you are very popular. And so I really appreciate there is 
a great need for both the protection and enhancement of our 
infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Let me quickly say I support $1.25 billion for 
transportation investment generating economic recovery. These 
are the TIDA Grants. TIDA Grants encourage cooperation between 
agencies and jurisdictions and often funds multimodal, 
multijurisdictional projects that are difficult to support 
through traditional transportation projects, and I think that 
is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I support $2.5 billion for New Starts Program. The New 
Starts Program provides funding for commuter rails, subway, 
light rail, ferries, and bus transit. And I want to make the 
point that Houston is a transit city, Harris County is a 
transit county. No one should suggest that the people of 
Houston do not advocate for transit. City government is a 
transit city government. Our metro is very responsive to the 
community, and we are eager to listen to members of Congress 
and community leaders on how best and how effective we can make 
this transit system. Harris County is a $4+ million metroplex 
area. The City of Houston is growing past a million and we need 
mass transit, and I would say that we need it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Panetta">So we support the Starts Program. We are one of the New 
Starts. We want to continue to finish our work. We just 
finished celebrating an overpass for the Harrisburg Bridge that 
will help that community make transit more effective. And we 
invite any of you to see how we are using the transit system. 
Certainly the Super Bowl evidenced how important our transit 
was and I think the NFL, if I might say, went away and said 
that we are one of the best cities in their scheme of cities 
for the Super Bowl and it was because of the transit system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I support $120 million for the Federal Transit Authority, 
provides grant funding to State, local, and tribal governments, 
public and private operators, and other recipients. And I 
support the funding request because access to transportation is 
a civil right, and that full funding for transit is imperative. 
It is very important for those citizens that rely upon it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I support the $2.3 billion for the Amtrak passenger rail. I 
think that is a vital part of that corridor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I support $3.1 billion for capital systems for high-speed 
rail corridors and inner-city passenger rail service. We are in 
the midst of a high-speed rail system in Texas. It is mostly 
privately funded. We are going through some of our challenges, 
but I know that it is an important element of our 
transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Panetta">The airport, the major airport, Bush Intercontinental 
Airport, is in my congressional district. I support $3.4 
billion for an airport improvement program which provides 
grants to public agencies for planning and development of 
public use airports. We are growing. We are growing in our 
terminals, we are growing in the per passenger travel. And the 
improvements, we hope that we have been important fiscal agents 
of the Federal Government in using your money effectively and 
building on the national system of aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Now, I understand there is rumor that there may be a 14 
percent cut in public housing, $6 billion. I don't know whether 
to throw myself on the floor or the table or to show you to 
have mercy. And I know it all deals with your--I do not want to 
use the term ``allotment,'' but what you all have to work with. 
I am on the Budget Committee. We will be seeing that budget 
next week, and I hope to be bipartisan in my passion that that 
just cannot be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I support $3 billion for Community Development Block Grant. 
We have not seen fraud of any extensive form. This is down 
payment for homes, this is fixing roofs after hurricanes. And 
we are loaded, what we call blue tarps, with senior citizens in 
my district still from Hurricane Ike. They have never had their 
roofs fixed. We have a program in the city that we are trying 
to fix it, Mr. Chairman, and trying to use that money 
effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Parks and other forms of community development are 
lifelines to inner city and rural communities, which I support 
greatly, even though there is an Agricultural Rule Program that 
I have been involved in and support heavily. And so I hope that 
is not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I support $120 million for housing for the elderly, and 
that is extreme in my community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I support $1.6 billion for the Home Investment Partnership 
Program, which is the largest combination for affordable 
housing. I worked with Habitat for Humanity. Our community 
helps build homes, but a lot of that is in partnership with 
Habitat for Humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I support $20 billion for the tenant-based rental 
assistance, $42 billion for fair housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I support $500 million for HUD-VASH program that is for our 
veterans; $87.5 million for housing counseling; $155 million 
for childhood lead poisoning. Just to comment that there is 
lead poisoning going on today in many of our communities and we 
cannot be less active in that program because our children are 
still getting lead poisoning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Finally, I support $355 million for housing opportunities 
for persons with AIDS. One of the first programs that I 
utilized as a member of the Houston City Council, still today 
is for housing for people living with AIDS, affected by AIDS, 
and it is an effective program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Panetta">So, Mr. Chairman, finally, you do great work. We want 
transit in Houston, Harris County; I want transit for the 
Nation. And, finally, I think that the HUD work for providing 
people access to housing is crucial and these are the programs 
that allow that to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Panetta">[The statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Mr. Diaz-Balart. Let me first thank the gentlelady for your 
testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Mr. Diaz-Balart. For your hard work. And by the way, you 
have done an extensive testimony, you have done it in record 
time. So again, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank the lady 
from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Mr. Diaz-Balart. We will now recognize The Honorable 
Congresswoman Plaskett. Thank you for being here. We look 
forward to your testimony.</paragraph>

HON. STACEY E. PLASKETT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE VIRGIN 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Plaskett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you, Chairman
Diaz-Balart, Ranking Member Price, for the opportunity to 
testify on appropriations for the Departments of Transportation 
and Housing and Urban Development over the next fiscal year. 
This legislation will serve as a statement of the commitment 
from the Federal Government to address some of our most 
pressing local needs in the Virgin Islands. In the United 
States territories, despite being home to nearly 4 million 
Americans, we are too often left out of important programs or 
underfunded compared to benefits available to Americans living 
in the mainland United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">For example, in the Virgin Islands, despite benefits we 
bring to the United States, including enormous tourism commerce 
from airline visits, cruise ships, and other vessels, Federal 
transportation funding to the Islands falls behind other 
jurisdictions even though the traffic strain on our 
infrastructure is often greater due to the high number of 
visitors year round. We have approximately 105,000 individuals, 
but have several million tourists that visit and strain our 
infrastructure every year. Territorial roads continue to be 
under stress from inadequate capacity. And in the Virgin 
Islands most of the Federal highways do not meet current 
standards. Because the territories are islands, most of the 
road construction is much more expensive than the mainland to 
accommodate due to supplier costs, costs of transportation. As 
a result of inadequate funds, crucial projects have been 
shelved, leaving only stopgap repairs to resolve maintenance 
issues, even on primary artery highways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">I would like to emphasize that this negatively impacts 
everything, from commerce to disaster relief management, 
emergency response, law enforcement capacity, and my own shock-
absorbing bills that I have to pay for our vehicle on the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Extreme weather during hurricane season annually 
demonstrates how fragile our infrastructure is and how much we 
depend on it. The territories are generally less well off than 
the States economically, partly due to lower per capita 
domestic product. And we pay higher prices for many basic 
necessities. We do not have local revenue means to provide for 
needed highway infrastructure without Federal assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Although the goal of bringing the territories into economic 
parity with the States has been a principle embraced by several 
acts of Congress over decades of partnership work, this has yet 
to be fulfilled in the area of transportation infrastructure. 
Each of the territories were acquired for specific strategic 
purposes and we continue to be of vibrant strategic value to 
the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Accordingly, I request full funding at or above current 
authorization levels for the territorial highway program over 
the next fiscal year. I also join others in calling for 
enhanced funding for TIGER Grants, preferably at or above the 
fiscal 2017 requested levels of $1.25 billion. TIGER Grants 
have been particularly important for our ports and 
transshipment projects in the Virgin Islands, which we believe 
will have adequate benefit to us in terms of growing our 
economies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">I also welcome recent statements from leaders in Congress 
on both sides of the aisle for new supplemental transportation 
infrastructure programs and decisions by the President for this 
to be part of his agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">If and when this committee will be working with the 
Authorizing Committee on any new transport expenditure program, 
it is imperative that the territories be fully incorporated in 
the package. New infrastructure projects in the Virgin Islands 
will create much-needed immediate jobs as well as help promote 
safety and security in an economy that is heavily based on 
tourism. There are numerous examples of needs that we have that 
are out of reach right now due to current levels of funding, 
but which could be covered with new or supplemental assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Again, I would point to our desire to really beef up our 
transshipment, our ports, which would grow our economy 
exponentially, provide jobs, and much-needed capital in the 
area. The U.S. Virgin Islands was purchased specifically 
because of our transshipment and our strategic location as the 
most easterly point in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">In addition, investment in airports and continued pressure 
on airlift is crucial to a place like the Virgin Islands. I 
urge that any discretionary program reforms expand eligibility 
in funding for the Airport Improvement Program, which has been 
very important for the necessary modernization of our airport 
on St. Thomas, Cyril King Airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">We also depend on well-funding maritime infrastructure. And 
I will be seeking fair inclusion of the Virgin Islands in the 
NHS and FTA Ferry Programs to assist in the purchase of much-
needed vessels to accommodate heightened transit demands along 
the route from St. Thomas to St. Croix. We at this point have 
to have duplicative services in every area, hospitals, our 
generators, everything because of the distance between the two 
major islands. Individuals cannot travel by airlift because of 
the cost, and so a ferry system would be really important to us 
to drive the cost down, stop some of the duplication, and 
really make our economy a much more vibrant one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">I also strongly support the inclusion of school 
construction and broadband expansion programs in any new 
infrastructure package. Many of the people living in the Virgin 
Islands do not have ordinary access to the computer connected 
to the Internet and this continues to have a negative impact on 
educational opportunities, workforce development for a growing 
isolated island economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Lastly, I would like to touch on housing-related programs, 
which service antipoverty tools for low-income people. Greater 
investment in home and CDBG Block Grants, Section 8 rental 
assistance, are critical for the availability of decent 
affordable housing in the Virgin Islands. These resources are 
especially important amid higher costs facing my constituents 
in communities across our country and I urge that they be 
strengthened through the next fiscal year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Thank you for the opportunity to present my testimony 
today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">[The statement of Ms. Plaskett follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Let me thank our colleague for bringing up 
very important issues. And it is important. And this is a 
subcommittee that has always been very sensitive to making sure 
that our territories are not only not forgotten, but they are 
emphasized.

    <speaker>Ms. Plaskett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Thank you. I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. So thank you. And now I know that Mr. 
Aguilar, he does not feel comfortable voting for things unless 
he sees it personally, so he might have to--but we will have to 
work on the potential.

    <speaker>Mr. Aguilar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Aguilar"> You did not talk about Houston, though.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Plaskett</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Mr. Chairman, you know the end of the month
is our 100th anniversary as being part of the United States. So 
all of you can come down for the celebrations on March 31 and 
get a view of it yourself, particularly you, Pete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Mr. Diaz-Balart. Thank you very much. We appreciate your 
testimony and we look forward to working with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Ms. Plaskett">Why don't we then now take a short recess and let us 
reconvene at 11:25, if there is no objection. Without 
objection.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">                                           Thursday, March 9, 2017.
HON. MATTHEW CARTWRIGHT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cartwright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">All right, and I want to thank all my
fellow appropriators for having me here today. Today, I want to 
talk about three policy areas where I urge your subcommittee to 
give attention during the fiscal year 2018 appropriations 
process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">First one is lead hazard control. I want to invite your 
attention to the persistent problem of lead in our communities 
and to advocate for full funding support for the Office of Lead 
Hazard Control and Healthy Homes in the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development. Citizens across the country are rightly 
concerned about the threat of lead to public health, and 
obviously that was something that was brought to the floor in 
Flint, Michigan. But in districts like mine, the threat of lead 
comes not just from the public drinking water systems, but also 
from old plumbing and paint in our houses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">As you may know, in fiscal year 2014, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention spent nearly $2 million as a 
part of a 3-year funding commitment to help some of the biggest 
cities in the country monitor lead exposure. The results were 
alarming. In Pennsylvania, nearly 10 percent of the more than 
140,000 kids tested had elevated levels of lead in their blood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">The major cities in my district, Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, 
have a high percentage of homes built before the 1940s when the 
use of lead-used paint was highly prevalent. That is why I 
strongly support robust funding for HUD's lead prevention 
programs. The Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes 
provides funds to State and local governments to develop cost-
effective ways to reduce lead-based paint hazards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">In addition, the Office enforces HUD's lead-based paint 
regulations, it provides outreach and technical assistance, and 
conducts technical studies to help protect children and their 
families from health and safety hazards in the home. As the 
problem of lead in our homes and its impact on our health and 
our children's health persists, we need to continue this 
important work, and I do ask the subcommittee to provide full 
funding for that office's efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">Secondly, rail. I urge the subcommittee to increase its 
support for our long-neglected national railway network. In 
many parts of the world, especially in Europe and in the 
emerging fast-growing economies of Asia, citizens enjoy 
advanced modern inner-city railway systems that improve their 
quality of life, drive business activity, and boost 
productivity. America has fallen behind the curve in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">In Northeastern Pennsylvania, where I live and represent, 
for example, our cities would benefit tremendously from rail 
links that connect our region to New York and New Jersey. This 
would help bring companies and growth to our region, improve 
the lives of the thousands of people who make a grueling 
commute, particularly from southern Monroe County, 
Pennsylvania, to greater New York City every day by car and 
bus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">In addition, investment in rail decreases road congestions, 
improved transportation safety, and curbs our emission of 
pollutants that contribute to climate change. And I know that 
Chairman Frelinghuysen has getting those cars off the road in 
northern New Jersey as one of his priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">By laying new tracks and increasing connectivity for our 
workers, entrepreneurs, and visitors, we will send a powerful 
signal to the private sector that our rural regions and cities 
are places where businesses can thrive and have access to 
resources, talent, and new ideas. In short, restoring an 
efficient railway network will create jobs in the near term and 
make our economy more competitive in the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">And finally, aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">I want to begin by commending the subcommittee's work in 
the area of aviation over the last 8 years. This committee has 
provided more than 99 percent of the FAA's budget requests. 
Your support of the programs and activities of the FAA are a 
recognition that the United States operates the largest, most 
complex air traffic control system in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">In that regard, I want to urge the subcommittee to continue 
its vigorous support for the FAA's effort to modernize our air 
traffic control system. Transitioning from ground-based radar 
navigation to satellite-based navigation is a complicated 
endeavor and through your support, the FAA has made noteworthy 
progress in its NextGen program from the installation of 
automatic dependent satellite broadcast ground stations to the 
advancements in data communications. Investments in NextGen 
will not only create a more efficient system, but will yield 
additional capacity and safety benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">Finally, I want to urge the subcommittee to continue to 
support efforts to ensure that our pilots are adequately 
trained and rested, to ensure our Nation's excellent record of 
safety. In that regard, I hope you will resist any efforts to 
weaken or eliminate regulations that put the flying public at 
risk. Our Nation's ATC system is a public asset and your work 
is supported by the millions of passengers that pay into the 
Airport and Airway Trust Fund each and every time they fly. I 
do hope you will continue to make your effort to ensure that 
our ATC system remains under your careful oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">I thank you for your time and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Cartwright">[The statement of Mr. Cartwright follows:]</paragraph>

HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Yes, thank you very much. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, the ranking member, and members of the Transportation 
and Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee. I want to thank 
you for an opportunity to allow me to speak to you today. I am 
one of the new members of Congress. I represent California's 
44th Congressional District. It includes the Port of Los 
Angeles and San Pedro, and then goes through areas like Compton 
and Watts, up into Southgate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Most notably, as I mentioned, is the Port of Los Angeles is 
in my district. It is North America's largest seaport. It 
touches every single congressional district in this country. I 
am proud to represent the thousands of workers that are 
directly and indirectly associated with the Port of Los 
Angeles. The San Pedro Bay ports, which includes both the L.A. 
port and the Long Beach port, accounts for one-quarter of the 
Nation's cargo and supports over 3 million jobs nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Ms. Barragan">My message today is simple. I urge you to invest in our 
Nation's freight transportation network, particularly on the 
multimodular transportation and on programs that provide 
comprehension solutions to combat homelessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Ms. Barragan">I want to start first with the freight transportation. With 
raising freight volumes, increasing population density, and 
growing international competition, we need to make sure to 
maintain and modernize and expand our infrastructure, including 
landslide freight connections that are necessary to move goods 
to and from our ports. A competitive grant program for freight 
and multimodular transportation, like fast-lane grants, will 
improve congestion, air quality, and helps goods get to where 
they need to go faster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Ms. Barragan">In 2014, the FAST Act was enacted into law, making freight 
a national issue, and the first time that ports and freight 
were fully integrated into the surface transportation network. 
Now, the FAST Act also established dedicated freight programs, 
including discretionary grant programs known as FASTLANE, which 
authorized $4.5 billion over 5 years. The goals of the FASTLANE 
program are to increase the U.S. global economic 
competitiveness, reduce congestion and bottlenecks, increase 
efficiency and reliability of the highway network, and reduce 
the environmental impact of freight movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Ms. Barragan">In keeping with these goals, one particular program that is 
of national significance is something that was just funded in 
2017 for the--rather, an application for the fiscal year 2017 
program at the Port of Los Angeles. We submitted an application 
known as America's Global Freight Gateway Southern California 
Rail Project. This request represents only 29 percent of the 
project's total cost. This investment is needed to accommodate 
more cargo via on-dock rail at the largest port complex in the 
Western Hemisphere while reducing community impacts inland by 
grade, separating high-priority railroad crossings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Now, the two Port of Los Angeles project components 
currently accommodate approximately $6 million for--rather, 
sorry, they accommodate approximately 6 percent of all 
waterborne containers entering and exiting the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Ms. Barragan">So I urge the subcommittee to fund FASTLANE grants at the 
authorized amounts of $900 million for fiscal year 2018, and 
$850 million for the fiscal year 2017. I also want to mention 
that Congress should consider raising or eliminating the $500 
million lifetime cap for multimodule projects, like highway 
connectors and on-dock rail, that are needed to move goods to 
and from our port.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Ms. Barragan">I will move on to homelessness. It is a issue that has just 
been exploding just throughout the country, more so in Los 
Angeles. And my district in Los Angeles County has the highest 
homeless population in the Nation with 47,000 homeless men, 
women, and children on any given night. It has reached epidemic 
proportions and I urge this body to support programs that will 
help break the silence, the cycle of homelessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Just to highlight one of the programs is the Continuum of 
Care. It provides a comprehensive solution to homelessness 
epidemic which emphasizes housing first and provides supportive 
services. In Carson and Compton, both in my district, the L.A. 
County Continuum of Care has been crucial in preventing a 
return to homelessness by providing comprehensive solutions 
that previous efforts lacked. The funds can be used to provide 
transitional housing, rapid rehousing, permanent supportive 
housing, support services, and planning to improve program 
performance. It has been successful and I urge the subcommittee 
to support the $2.7 billion for homeless assistance grants for 
fiscal years 2018 and 2017, specifically, the Continuum of Care 
program at $2.4 billion for both fiscal years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Ms. Barragan">To maintain housing affordability and prevent people from 
becoming homeless in the first place, we should support key 
programs that ensure access to affordable housing, such as the 
Community Block Development Grants. Since fiscal year 2010, 
CDBG has been cut nearly 25 percent, amounting to roughly $1 
billion annually. So just to get to the end here, I urge this 
committee to support things like HUD-VASH at a funding level of 
$75 million for both fiscal years 2018 and 2017. We do not have 
to accept homelessness. I think it is a solvable problem, and I 
thank this subcommittee for your time.</paragraph>

Louisiana.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Frelinghuysen">                                            Thursday, March 9, 2017
HON. MIKE JOHNSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Johnson">That is right, Mr. Chairman. Thank you and
committee members. We will go from the other L.A. to the real 
L-A and that is Louisiana, right?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Johnson">I appreciate the opportunity to come before you today to 
consider funding priorities for the fiscal year 2018. I am 
grateful for your continued support of our Nation's 
infrastructure and transportation priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Given the importance of northwest Louisiana's unique 
national security footprint and mixed infrastructure needs, I 
am truly thankful for the opportunity to bring important and 
noteworthy projects to your attention. I am going to try to 
speak quickly so I can get it all in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Today I share my support for providing adequate formula 
funding for the FAST Act, and specifically grant opportunities 
in the FASTLANE program to aid the national needs we have heard 
here today. My district, Louisiana's Fourth Congressional, 
contains five of the nine Louisiana Department of 
Transportation State sectors, and that makes us the largest. 
Within that area, my district contains 3,403 bridges; a total 
of over 20,000 miles of local and interstate roadway. It is 
also home to four shallow draft port authorities with 485 miles 
of navigable waterways, 7 freight railroads, and 875 miles of 
railroad track. Every single one of these areas are in need of 
immediate attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Johnson">We are a poor State and I know there are many needs in your 
own districts, as well. Long-term statewide transportation 
plans have identified incredibly significant amounts in 
transportation needs right now. And we demonstrated that 
without adequate funding of about $1.86 billion to address 
these critical infrastructure projects, efforts aimed to 
improve safety needs will go unaddressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Louisiana, despite maximizing and capturing available 
Federal dollars every year, sees a transportation budget that 
is only about 6- to $700 million annually, and it puts us 
drastically short of our critical needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Just as many of the other members have here stated, my 
State is in desperate need of immediate action. To provide just 
a few examples of the critical issues in this district, since 
January alone, we have had nine bridges that have been forced 
to shut down. According to official reports in recent years, 
northwest Louisiana's economic health and our quality of life 
are at risk if these transportation and infrastructure funding 
challenges continue to go unanswered. Without the necessary 
funding, it will not be possible to reverse the damage done by 
previous year's failures to address these economic challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Johnson">In the Fourth Congressional District of Louisiana alone, 
our statewide plan identifies at least 13 category A through D 
megaprojects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Given the realities of needing to maintain a fiscally 
balanced budget, we obviously accept that every infrastructure 
project cannot be met. But despite this fact, we have been 
presented with an opportunity to once again prioritize the most 
important and noteworthy projects. So in addition to advocating 
for adequate funding formula for the FAST Act, I would also ask 
that the committee support competitive grant opportunities and 
the FASTLANE program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Johnson">I would like to provide some specific examples, very 
quickly, of the infrastructure and highway projects in my 
district that are critical for improving not only the local 
economy, but national security, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Johnson">First, funding for the final portion of I-49. We have got 
3.6 miles of the proposed new highway that will intersect 
Shreveport, our largest city, in order to connect to I-49, at 
the I-20 interchange with I-49 North near the I-220 
interchange. This will add a seamless and helpful connection 
for a highway that extends all the way from Canada to New 
Orleans. This project will reduce travel time and travel 
distance for those remaining on I-49, and provide a more direct 
access to downtown Shreveport, as well as align needs for 
supporting current Air Force plans for our Air Force base at 
Barksdale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Johnson">A second example is with the interstate project of I-69. It 
has been named by the U.S. DOTD as one of the six corridors of 
the future. And construction of I-69 is critically important to 
provide exponential resources to the port of Shreveport 
Bossier, Barksdale Air Force Base, and a much-needed loop 
around the urban area of Shreveport and Bossier City. In 
northwest Louisiana, the sections of independent utility 14, 
15, and 16 need to be completed in order for the project to 
continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Third, we have a project that would greatly benefit from 
these programs, the interstate widening efforts for I-49 and I-
20 in the Fourth Congressional District. The I-20 corridor is 
congested with vehicle traffic at several points with 
conditions expected to worsen in the coming years. And grant 
opportunities have the potential to allow for further 
development of these interstates. They are critical for the 
economies of the local regions and States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Bossier Parish is one of the fastest growing areas of our 
State, and this rapid growth has caused severe traffic 
congestion, especially on Highway 3 and Highway 3105, Benton 
Road and Airline Drive. And that congestion threatens future 
development in the area. We have to act now. We need funding 
for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Last but not least, I would like to mention the Barksdale 
Air Force Base gate project. Barksdale is a key national 
security asset located in Bossier Parish that does not have 
sufficient direct access to the interstate system. It is an 
issue which is a hindrance to national Air Force priority, and 
I met with our four-star general there about this 2 weeks ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Johnson">The State is advancing a project to fix this, supporting 
DOD's investment in our national security and in our State. The 
project will improve base security and connect the new public 
road extending from I-20 at the I-220 interchange to a new gate 
at Barksdale Air Force Base, moving the commercial vehicle 
inspection station away from aircraft approach. We think this 
is critical, especially for the future weapons storage and 
maintenance facility that will be there. And it has a 
preliminary cost estimate of 80- to $100 million. However, 
there is an immediate $11.8 million fiscal year 2019 MILCON 
request by the Air Force which has been briefed to the 
Secretary of Transportation and our State's governor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Like each of you, I have got dozens of projects that I 
could go on about. I realize that I am quickly running out of 
time, but in addition to these new capacity projects, costs to 
maintain the transportation system we already have continue to 
grow. Providing the needed resources to competitive grant 
opportunities in the FASTLANE program to address longstanding 
challenges will serve as an economic generator and help 
protections for Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and our surrounding 
areas. It is my understanding that many of these top priority 
infrastructure projects have been raised to the President, as 
well as to our governor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Johnson">I know I am out of time and I want to thank you again for 
your hard work and your diligent efforts on all these things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Johnson">[The statement of Mr. Johnson follows:]</paragraph>

HON. BRADLEY BYRNE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Byrne</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Byrne">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I might say I am from
the other L-A, lower Alabama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Byrne">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. I always thought that was part of Florida, 
by the way, lower Alabama.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Byrne</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Byrne">It used to be at one time. We were the
independent nation of West Florida for about 10 months in the 
1810s, and neither the British nor the Americans thought that 
was a good idea, so we are part of America now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Byrne">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Well, it is a pleasure to have you here. 
Thank you, sir, and you are recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Byrne</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Byrne">Thank you very much. It is a pleasure for me to
be here today. I want to applaud the efforts of this committee 
which have resulted in steady progress towards improving our 
Nation's infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Byrne">I was proud to support the Fixing America's Surface 
Transportation, or FAST, Act back in 2015, and I support the 
financing necessary to ensure the bill's implementation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Byrne">Despite our best efforts, there are many areas across the 
country that continue to have major transportation needs. For 
example, we continue to have a real transportation problem on 
I-10 along the Gulf Coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Byrne">In my hometown of Mobile, I consistently and repeatedly 
experience delays at the George Wallace Tunnel. Due to the 
tunnel's height and odd design, traffic accidents and incidents 
often occur. These result in people traveling around I-10 
sitting in traffic for hours, pushing toward 3- to 4-hour 
delays in the summer months as people are traveling to and from 
the beaches. Some of those are Florida beaches, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Byrne">This portion of I-10 is incredibly important to our area as 
well, given its close proximity to the Port of Mobile and the 
need to ensure the safe and expedient flow of commerce to and 
from the port.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Byrne">Just as important, I-10 serves as an evacuation route 
during hurricane season, and I know I do not have to tell you 
the importance of that, Mr. Chairman. The current traffic 
situation could result in Americans being left in harm's way 
during a severe weather event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Byrne">We have made important progress over the last few years 
working together with local, State, and Federal officials to 
move forward with a new I-10 bridge across the Mobile River. 
Former Secretary of Transportation Foxx came to Mobile to see 
the project, and he saw the need firsthand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Byrne">So, I ask the committee to fully fund the various 
transportation programs in the FAST Act in order to allow 
projects like the I-10 bridge in Mobile to move forward. This 
project is a textbook definition of a nationally and regionally 
significant highway project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Byrne">I am encouraged by President Trump's commitment to 
improving infrastructure. I completely agree with the 
President. However, we must be smart about how we make these 
future investments to rebuilding and boosting our Nation's 
infrastructure to ensure precious resources are not wasted on 
unnecessary or wasteful projects, which brings me to my other 
reason for sitting before you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Byrne">I want to urge the committee to avoid mistakes from the 
past, like funding for California high-speed rail. Looking back 
at 2009, the Obama administration spent $8 billion for 
transportation. One-quarter of that funding, $2 billion, went 
to California high-speed rail. This project was by no means 
``shovel ready.'' In fact, more than 8 years later, the land 
has not even been fully procured to complete the project. 
Today, California has not met any of the obligations to match 
the Federal funding. Even worse, almost another billion dollars 
was given to California in 2010, and the project remains 
embarrassingly behind schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Byrne">The Los Angeles Times reported that the project ``will cost 
taxpayers 50 percent more than estimated, as much as $3.6 
billion more, and that is just for the first 118 miles through 
the Central Valley, which was supposed to be the easiest part 
of the route between Los Angeles and San Francisco.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Byrne">This is the definition of a boondoggle, Mr. Chairman. We 
all heard about the ``Bridge to Nowhere.'' It is safe to call 
this the ``Train from Nowhere to Nowhere.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Byrne">This is one of the largest wastes of taxpayer money ever. 
Given the many serious transportation needs around the country, 
it is a shame so much funding was wasted on California high-
speed rail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Byrne">I hope the committee will use this disaster example of 
California high-speed rail to ensure funding is going, first 
and foremost, to nationally and regionally significant projects 
instead of boondoggles. We must make smart investments in our 
Nation's most serious infrastructure needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Byrne">Thank you very much for your time today. I appreciate the 
opportunity to share my thoughts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Byrne">[The statement of Mr. Byrne follows:]</paragraph>

of it does touch my district, and it even comes to the point 
where we think it might even touch my own personal property. I

    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Sires">As a former mayor, I understand how critical these programs 
are to communities across the country, especially our low-
income communities. As you may know, President Gerald Ford 
signed this legislation creating the CDBG Program in 1974 to 
provide annual formula grants to local governments and States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Sires">Over 40 years later, the CDBG Program continues to provide 
funding for critical projects across our country that urban and 
rural communities would otherwise be unable to afford. These 
grants make investments in local and regional infrastructure, 
spur job creation, and fight poverty in communities that need 
it the most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Sires">Communities utilize this funding to rebuild streets, 
rehabilitate community centers, improve parks, and replace 
water mains that are badly in need of repair. These funds also 
support youth and homeless services, employment training, and 
projects to provide suitable living for the disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Sires">Importantly, these funds are flexible enough that local 
officials can direct them in areas that need them the most. The 
CDBG Program has been incredibly successful throughout its 40-
year history, and I know firsthand it has made a lasting 
impression on towns and cities across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Sires">Like the CDBG Program, the HOME Program supports projects 
that would not otherwise be feasible. Using HOME funds, 
communities partner with local nonprofits to fund projects 
renovating and building or purchasing affordable housing for 
lower income Americans. These projects provide shelters for 
veterans, senior citizens, and the working poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Sires">As our Nation's affordable housing infrastructure grows 
older, grants from the HOME Program become more and more 
critical to providing safe and affordable housing for those who 
need it most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Sires">On behalf of 1,000 cities in New Jersey's congressional 
districts and the thousands of people impacted by these 
programs, I urge you to support both the CDBG Program and the 
HOME Program as you continue your appropriations process. Thank 
you very much for the time given to me today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Sires">[The statement of Mr. Sires follows:]</paragraph>

HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Espaillat</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">Thank you, Chairman, Ranking Member Price.
Let me just start by congratulating the chairman on the recent 
award he got at the dinner with his brother, Lincoln Diaz-
Balart, for the contributions of him and his family to public 
service. I was delighted to be there, where I found out the 
handsome level of funding that he will be impacting on for HUD. 
So, I hope to work very closely with him as we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. With his introduction, I think he is doing 
really well. I think it was brilliant and on point.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Espaillat</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">I hope to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Right, Mr. Price?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Price</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Price">Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Price">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Thank you for your kind words, and again, 
you are recognized, and we thank you for being here.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Espaillat</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">Thank you for allowing me to testify during
today's subcommittee hearing to lay out my priorities as they 
relate to transportation, housing, and urban development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">It is my hope that Congress will enact regular full-year 
fiscal year 2018 appropriations for HUD programs prior to the 
end of fiscal year 2017. It is my understanding that none of 
the fiscal year 2017 regular appropriation bills were enacted 
before the end of fiscal year 2016, and Congress instead 
approved two continuing resolutions to provide temporary 
funding. This provides funding through April 28, 2017, which is 
just around the corner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">When it comes to housing, this kind of insecurity is hardly 
acceptable. Moreover, a recent news report has revealed that 
the administration is proposing cuts to operational funds by 
$600 million, so 13 percent of the budget, and these are 
serious cuts, and for big ticket repair items for public 
housing, cuts in the amount of $1.3 billion, or 32 percent. 
This is also a very serious level of cuts for public housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">Now, traditionally we think that infrastructure is just 
roads, bridges, and tunnels, but we as landlords, because 
public housing happens to be our housing--in fact, the 
President lives in public housing. The White House is public 
housing; we as members of Congress are the landlords, the 
owners of these housing units, and so is the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">We should own up to our responsibility to provide a safe, 
healthy, and sustainable life setting in these units, in over 
1.2 million units of public housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">I am submitting testimony because I am concerned with 
reports stating that domestic discretionary funding may suffer 
at great cost. This is particularly concerning, as it relates 
to already poor and struggling communities, like Washington 
Heights, Harlem, Inwood, the Bronx, and East Harlem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">The Housing Choice Vouchers Program and the Section 8 
Rental Program are on the chopping blocks. My district has the 
most number of housing units in the City of New York and, 
therefore, the Nation, and has the second most residents in 
terms of population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">Having been an organizer, I understand the effects of 
housing needs, the need to protect low-income renters from 
being displaced from their homes, and the importance and 
growing needs for increased funding for Section 8 housing. Now, 
the cuts that are being proposed also include cuts in Section 8 
Housing Vouchers for people like homeless veterans at the tune 
of $300 million, or from $300 million to potentially $19.3 
billion. So, this is very concerning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">New York City Housing Preservation and Development, HPD, 
and the New York City Housing Authority, NYCHA, collectively 
administer over 123,000 vouchers that provide critical rental 
assistance to families across the city. These vouchers are a 
lifeline for more than 294,000 families in New York City. Since 
the 2009 sequestration, New York City families have lost nearly 
13,000 vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">New York City is home to the country's largest public 
housing authority, and its impact is monumental for low-income 
and working families in a high-cost city. Public housing is a 
valuable asset for more than 400,000 New Yorkers. That is 
bigger than many cities throughout the United States. This is 
an asset that needs to be fully funded to prevent the loss of 
even more public housing units in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">Public housing operations and capital have been underfunded 
for many, many years, putting long-term viability of the units 
at risk, and resulting in health impacts for residents, 
including asthma, respiratory illnesses, which are a major 
public health concern for public housing residents throughout 
the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">New York City has a 5-year backlog of capital needs, 
nearing $17 billion. This is the largest unmet need in the 
Nation, and a significant portion of HUD's total capital 
backlog assessed at $26 billion in 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">An increase in funding will be invested in capital repairs 
which could tackle the public housing needs and health 
concerns. Many of the public housing units in our country are 
in disarray, and with an added $600 million, units could 
address more remediation, including roof repairs, brick 
repairs, piping, asbestos removal, and other issues that lead 
to increases in health concerns for low-income residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">My time is about to expire, Mr. Chairman, but I do want to 
stress the importance of having funding channeled to public 
housing. In my opinion, infrastructure should include our 
public housing network, and we should provide adequate funding 
for families to have a safe and healthy environment in which 
they live. We as landlords have that responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">Thank you so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Espaillat">[The statement of Mr. Espaillat follows:]</paragraph>

HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Visclosky</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">Mr. Chairman, Mr. Price, and members of the
committee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you 
today. I feel like I have come home. My mentor in another 
century was chairman of this great subcommittee, so it is good 
to be back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">I am here today to emphasize my support and ask for your 
support for the Federal Transit Administration's Capital 
Investment Grant Program and the New Starts, and Core Capacity 
Grants Program. All of you understand the importance of transit 
and its economic and beneficial impact throughout the United 
States. I want to give you a real world example in northwest 
Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">Lake County, Indiana, which is the most populous county I 
represent, is on Lake Michigan and it is contiguous to the City 
of Chicago. Lake County, Illinois, is on Lake Michigan and it 
is contiguous to the City of Chicago. Since 1970, the 
population of Lake County, Indiana, which I represent, has 
declined by 10 percent. The fact is, the population for Lake 
County, Illinois, has grown by 83 percent. The median household 
income in Lake County, Indiana, in the similar period of time 
has declined by 12.5 percent. The median household income in 
Lake County, Illinois, has increased by 17.7 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">I would propose to you one of the fundamental differences 
is that on the Illinois side of the State line between our two 
great States there are over 470 miles of mass transit line, 
many of which go to Lake County, Illinois. On the Indiana side, 
it is as though someone built a great wall. There are 38 miles 
of mass transit in Indiana going to Michigan City. The line 
then extends to South Bend. We have been working for a 
generation to connect ourselves to the economy of Chicago, 
which is larger than the economy of Sweden, to not only access 
that economy, but to draw down its benefits to northwest 
Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">Over the past several years, we have had 16 of the 20 
communities in Lake County make a long-term, 30-year commitment 
to meet and match Federal funding. I would point out that in 
his capacity as governor, Vice President Pence in 2015 signed 
State legislation for a long-term, 30-year commitment to meet 
that Federal program. This year in his budget, Governor Holcomb 
in the State of Indiana has included money to meet those 
Federal grant programs. We will apply in August.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">But all of this effort for a generation will be for naught 
if that capital investment grant program is not adequately 
funded. Currently in 2016, the appropriation was $2.17 billion, 
which was sustained due to the enactment of the continuing 
resolution. I would point out in this committee's markup for 
the House you included $2.5 billion, obviously understanding 
the value of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">It is not limited to the coast, it is not limited to 
northwest Indiana. You have projects in places like El Paso, 
Texas; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I 
would strongly urge you, when we talk about infrastructure in 
this Congress and we talk about investing in the economy, to 
ensure that we preserve these programs, not just for the 
congressional district I represent, but recognizing that, since 
2012, requests for these types of capital construction have 
increased from 37 to 63. Because communities throughout our 
great Nation understand the importance economically for good-
paying job growth that this Federal investment of our taxes 
represent. And again, I appreciate the opportunity to be before 
you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">[The statement of Mr. Visclosky follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Well, let me thank you, sir, and obviously 
you are somebody who understands the appropriations process as 
well if not better than anybody in this building and this 
facility. So obviously we look forward to working with you. Mr. 
Price, any comments or questions?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Price</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Price"> I want to thank our colleague and friend for
being here and for taking note of the attention this committee 
paid in the current cycle to New Starts, and the importance of 
getting closer to that number, hopefully, with a 5-month 
omnibus bill for the remainder of 2017. In the meantime, you 
have given a very convincing rationale rooted in your own 
district's experience for the importance of this going forward, 
so we appreciate that.

    <paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. Visclosky">Appreciate your efforts very much. Thank you
so much.</paragraph>

Suozzi. And again, thank you for being here on time and, again,

HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Suozzi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ranking
Member Price, and the other members that are here today for the 
subcommittee. I want to thank you for the opportunity and the 
time to discuss my request for funding the health impacts of 
airplane noise at some of our busiest airports throughout the 
country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">Recently, I was elected as co-chair of the Quiet Skies 
Caucus along with Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, and we 
are fortunate to have Congressmen Quigley and Lynch serve as 
co-vice chairs of the caucus. All of us, along with dozens of 
other members from both sides of the aisle, have constituents 
who are deeply impacted by unacceptable levels of airplane and 
aircraft noise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">I am a new member of this distinguished body, but while 
exploring a run for this office, aircraft noise was one of the 
first issues I heard about from voters. At a town hall I had 
held last June, a constituent rose to ask about what I would do 
and could as a member of Congress to reduce aircraft noise over 
her home and in that neighborhood. In fact, she was interrupted 
twice during the conversation in less than 2 minutes by 
aircraft passing overhead. The noise was so loud, she had to 
pause and wait for planes to pass before she could continue 
asking her question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">I represent New York's Third Congressional District. The 
district stretches from northeastern Queens along Long Island's 
north shore through Nassau County and Suffolk County. My 
constituents have two of the world's busiest and biggest 
airport, LaGuardia airport and John F. Kennedy International 
Airport, that lie just beyond the district's boundaries. 
Although both airports are outside the district, both rely on 
flight paths that traverse numerous neighborhoods in and around 
my district. This is not a discrete problem affecting a limited 
number of people, but a major issue impacting people across the 
country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">Many of us rely on Reagan National Airport to return home 
each week. Congresswoman Holmes Norton's district's 
constituents, who call Washington, D.C., home, are impacted by 
travelers like ourselves, who come from our districts to engage 
in the people's business or visit our Nation's capital. Mr. 
Quigley's constituents live near O'Hare International Airport, 
one of the world's busiest airports, and suffer greatly under 
the volume of flights that land and depart every day. And Mr. 
Lynch's constituents in and around Boston's Logan Airport also 
suffer from unacceptable noise levels along with constituents 
of dozens of other members who are part of the Quiet Skies 
Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">This is not a partisan issue. Mr. Coffman of Colorado is a 
member of the Quiet Skies Caucus and works with us on behalf of 
his constituents to alleviate and reduce unacceptable noise 
levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">Our friends in the Senate also believe this is an important 
issue. Senators McCain and Flake of Arizona have championed 
this cause and have taken the lead in the Senate to help 
mitigate noise from aircraft in Arizona and across the country. 
I have tried to make the case that unacceptable noise levels is 
a bipartisan national issue of significance worthy of 
congressional attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">Today my primary goal is to impart the significance of the 
issue to you and my colleagues. One of the key takeaways was a 
realization from a town hall meeting I had that there is an 
ongoing failure to understand the seriousness of this issue. In 
other words, we still need to persuade the Federal Aviation 
Administration and others that this is not a subjective 
complaint of a bunch of cranks, but an objective problem 
harming human health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">In order to legitimize concerns, I believe we need to 
federally fund health studies conducted by the leading 
universities of our country to demonstrate that this issue 
objectively raises health concerns. I have followed up with 
members of the Quiet Skies Caucus and found they agree with 
this conclusion and even relayed their own constituents' 
frustrations that their complaints are often dismissed without 
due consideration. We believe these health studies which will 
objectively determine the impact on individuals and their 
families' health will demonstrate the need for all stakeholders 
to address the issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">In addition to health studies, and while they are 
conducted, I believe other steps should be taken in the 
interim. Many districts are experiencing unacceptable noise 
levels as a result of the NextGen route changes. While the FAA 
says the noise is within the acceptable 65 day/night level, 
that standard was developed more than a decade ago. I believe 
that the FAA needs to conduct an expedited review of the 65 DNL 
standard and incorporate actual noise sampling, not just rely 
on the modeling and simulation. Therefore, I ask the Committee 
to include report language urging the FAA to expedite DNL 
review and to provide the Committee with a report no later than 
60 days after enactment of the act describing a pilot program 
for conducting actual noise sampling as part of the DNL review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">On its face, this issue may appear to be one of mere 
annoyance, but I can assure you that it is not a trivial issue. 
The members and Senators I have mentioned above, and many more, 
can echo and expand upon the thoughts and points I have raised 
today. Our constituents raise legitimate concerns because they 
are subjected to unacceptable noise levels at a volume and 
frequency that have dramatically impacted their quality of life 
and their health. My hope is that the subcommittee will join 
with us to assist from across the country by raising the 
profile of this issue and working with us towards results and 
getting things done for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">Thank you so much for your time. I cannot imagine what is 
like for you to listen to everybody's different requests that 
come in here, but I am very grateful for the opportunity to be 
here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">[The statement of Mr. Suozzi follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Well, let me first thank the gentleman. 
And I will tell you, obviously, on this subcommittee we have 
Mr. Quigley, who never lets us forget the issue that you have 
just brought up, and just know that we look forward to working 
with you.

will be our last colleague testifying in front of us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Suozzi">While he gets ready, let me just tell you that Mr. Lawson 
is a freshman, but he has been involved in Florida politics. He 
and I served in the Florida legislature and so it is, frankly, 
a real personal--just it is wonderful to recognize him here now 
as a colleague as we were for many years in the Florida 
legislature and now in the United States Congress. So on a 
personal level, it is great to see you here, sir, and obviously 
as chairman let me recognize you for your testimony.</paragraph>

HON. AL LAWSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lawson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Lawson">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it is a real
privilege for me to be here with you and I am real honored to 
be able to represent the Fifth Congressional District in 
Florida. I need to say that it runs all the way to 
Jacksonville, you know, from Gaston County to Jacksonville, to 
make sure to include it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Lawson">There are a number of critical programs that I would like 
to discuss given the importance of our district. First, I would 
like to see full funding for the Capital Investment Grants 
Investment Program. These projects not only generate economic 
development, but also help to reduce energy consumption. I know 
the subcommittee has been very supportive of these programs and 
your work should be applauded for providing over $408 million 
in fiscal year 2017, the THUD bill more funding than the Senate 
bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Lawson">I would like to highlight one project for my district that 
is currently in the small start pipeline for funding. The 
Jacksonville Transportation Authority had begun implementing a 
57-mile bus rapid transit, the BRT, network system called the 
First Coast Flyer. It is made up of five district lines, two of 
which are already operating. The fiscal year 2017 bill, there 
is currently $14.9 million pending for the First Coast Flyer 
East corridor and for fiscal year 2018 budget, $37.9 million 
for the Southwest corridor. I would like to see both projects 
funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Lawson">The BRT is an important investment in Jacksonville public 
transportation system. It has provided us with a variety of 
options to develop safe, reliable, premium service in a cost-
effective manner. I would like to see the subcommittee continue 
to provide funding for the TIGER Grants program and bus 
facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Lawson">Finally, I recently had the opportunity to visit Eureka 
Gardens Apartments, a privately owned, subsidized apartment 
community in Jacksonville. Like most Americans, the residents 
of Eureka Gardens want a clean, affordable, and safe place to 
raise their families and to call home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Lawson">The conditions I saw really kind of broke my heart. Sadly, 
under the previous management company, Eureka Garden has fallen 
into a horrible state of disrepair where residents have to 
combat black mold, infestation, gas leaks, the loss of heat and 
hot water, no air-conditioning, and persistent crime problems 
which is very prevalent. It is my firm belief that the people 
who pay rent, regardless of their income, neighborhood, or 
whether they live in privately owned or public housing, have 
the right to expect and get routine maintenance, and that no 
one should be forced to live in conditions that threaten health 
or safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Lawson">It is my hope that as the committee begins to put together 
the 2018 budget that it would consider adding additional 
funding for oversight, renovation, and modernization of older 
public and private housing units. Not only that it was brought 
to my attention, it was also brought to the attention of 
Senator Rubio, who had the opportunity to visit that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Lawson">It is my hope that a separate line of funding could be made 
available for small, medium, and large communities. I would 
also ask that the committee consider providing low-income loans 
to owners of subsidized housing until--units to make necessary 
repairs to their facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Lawson">I want to thank you all for this opportunity to share with 
the subcommittee my thoughts on funding and thank you again for 
ongoing support of these programs. I really cannot say enough 
about the chairman's commitment that he had in the State of 
Florida. I had the opportunity to work with him and it is truly 
an honor to be reunited with the chairman here, and I am sure 
that he remembers all of the good things that we did in the 
State of Florida, even though he was, in my opinion, the 
southern part of Florida, and we always thought they were 
separated from America. We were up there around Georgia and 
Alabama, but it was a big difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Mr. Lawson">So we were still able to work together and I am so honored 
to have the opportunity for the first time, to meet many of you 
all, and to realize that I have got 13 seconds, I want to thank 
you all for this great opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Lawson">[The statement of Mr. Lawson follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Lawson">Mr. Diaz-Balart. Well, let me just again, for those of you, 
Mr. Price and others, as he said, he and I worked together, we 
conspired together on a lot of difficult issues. And just be 
forewarned, he will not let us forget the issues that are 
important to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Lawson">    So thank you, sir, and, again, an honor. And you are right, 
for me, it is a personal moment of personal satisfaction to be 
able to be reunited with you, sir. Mr. Price.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Price</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Price"> Mr. Lawson, we are very happy to have you here.
We can benefit, I think, from your years of experience and your 
political savvy as well as your attention to the needs of your 
part of Florida. So we look forward to working with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lawson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Lawson">Thank you so much, I look forward to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Lawson">Mr. Diaz-Balart. Let me now just thank each and every 
member of the subcommittee, also those members who came to 
testify on their THUD priorities today. We appreciate the 
opportunity to hear their testimony and we are pleased to share 
this process with all of us. As I said earlier, everyone's 
written testimony will be included in the record.</paragraph>

    <witnesses>WITNESSES</witnesses>
    <option>CALVIN L. SCOVEL III, INSPECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
DAVID A. MONTOYA, INSPECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN 
    DEVELOPMENT
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. I am going to call the meeting to 
order. But before we start, I do want to announce that, 
obviously, since we have two inspectors general today, I just 
want to announce that there is another inspector general here, 
and that is my personal inspector general, and that is my wife, 
Tia, who is here along with my son, Cristian. They do not get 
the opportunity to come up to Washington a lot, so it is great 
to have them here today.
    With that, today, we welcome Inspectors General, The 
Honorable Calvin Scovel from the Department of Transportation, 
and The Honorable David Montoya from the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development. So the oversight work, gentlemen, that 
you do for our committee, and for our country, frankly, is 
vital. Please know that we cherish what you do. You ensure that 
tax dollars are being well-spent and that those dollars are 
stretched as far as possible, whether it is for our Nation's 
transportation or housing needs. We rely on your good work, on 
your judgment, on your dedication to find waste and fraud and 
abuse in agencies, and, obviously, that is something that you 
do not tolerate and we do not tolerate. So when we have 
concerns regarding the management and effectiveness within both 
departments, you know that we look to you for much-needed 
oversight and guidance, and the guidance that you provide 
through, again, your various audits and the investigations that 
you all do. So you help us get there, you help us get these 
agencies back on track as much as humanly possible and ensure 
that they are working as efficiently and as effectively as 
possible. We look forward to your testimony.
    With that, let me recognize the Ranking Member of this 
committee, a person who we work very closely together, the 
gentleman from the great State of North Carolina, Mr. Price, 
for any opening remarks that he might have. You are recognized, 
sir.
    Mr. Price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I join you in welcoming 
Mr. Scovel and Mr. Montoya here today. I will keep this 
statement relatively brief, because we will need to get to the 
questions, but I want to just underscore a few concerns.
    The oversight hearing is an important opportunity for us to 
examine the key management challenges facing the Departments of 
Transportation and HUD. Many of these issues are not new. For 
example, HUD has struggled to modernize its IT infrastructure, 
facing ongoing challenges associated with human capital 
management, and over the years, failed to establish 
sufficiently strong internal controls over how it obligates and 
controls funds.
    Meanwhile, the DOT Inspector General has highlighted 
ongoing challenges associated with the safe integration of new 
transportation technology, namely, unmanned drones and 
autonomous vehicles, as well as the department's management of 
certain high-risk contracts. I look forward to exploring these 
topics in more detail this morning.
    I am also concerned with the Trump administration's 
painfully slow pace when it comes to the appointments of deputy 
and assistant secretaries and other high-ranking officials. You 
simply cannot run a complex department without a strong 
leadership team in place beneath the Secretary.
    Compounding the problem is the recently announced Federal 
hiring freeze imposed by the Trump administration, which, I 
believe, could threaten core government functions if it is left 
in place. The GAO has noted that across-the-board hiring 
freezes are almost always counterproductive.
    Finally, the Trump administration to-date has shown a 
blatant disregard for addressing possible conflicts of 
interest, starting with, but limited to, the man at the top. 
Oversight is a key function of Congress, but it is especially 
integral to the work of the Appropriations Committee. 
Independent inspectors general enable this subcommittee to 
conduct effective oversight, make informed funding decisions to 
ensure our limited Federal dollars are spent wisely, and that 
most certainly includes exploring conflicts of interest. I will 
address that in our question period.
    So I look forward to learning more about how HUD and DOT 
are meeting their management challenges and where they stand to 
improve. Thank you, both, for being here today. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Thank you very much, Mr. Price. 
Today, we will begin with the Department of Transportation's 
Inspector General, Mr. Scovel. Your full written testimony, 
sir, will be included in the record, and we look forward to 
listening to your testimony. You are recognized for five 
minutes.
    Mr. Scovel. Chairman Diaz-Balart, Ranking Member Price, 
members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to 
testify today on the Department of Transportation's (DOT) top 
management challenges. Every year, DOT invests more than $70 
billion to operate and modernize our transportation 
infrastructure. My office supports these efforts through audits 
and criminal investigations that identify and help protect 
against fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. I greatly 
appreciate the subcommittee's support and continued focus on 
the important work of government oversight performed by offices 
like mine and that of Inspector General Montoya.
    My testimony today focuses on three critical challenge 
areas that we have identified for DOT for 2017: safety, 
stewardship, and completion of mandates and recommendations. As 
Secretary Chao has noted, safety remains at the forefront of 
DOT's mission. The United States continues to have one of the 
safest transportation systems in the world. However, new 
technologies and industries bring new challenges.
    For example, FAA recently issued a rule to help safely 
integrate small unmanned aircraft systems, known as UAS, into 
our airspace. However, the number of UAS sightings by pilots 
and others continues to go up, over 1,400 this past year, as 
compared to just over 200 in 2014. Many of these occurred at 
altitudes where other aircraft operate. Maintaining safety will 
require a strong risk-based oversight system by FAA and 
coordination with other agencies.
    Similarly, the emerging technology of driverless cars poses 
new safety challenges for DOT and NHTSA. Several companies are 
already developing, testing, and selling various iterations, 
and the number is expected to grow quickly. DOT and 
policymakers must clearly define the tools and standards 
necessary to oversee and regulate this industry and the 
technology underlying it.
    At the same time, NHTSA must continue to improve its 
processes for investigating vehicle safety defects. Most 
recently, a Takata air bag defect resulted in 11 fatalities and 
180 injuries. Due in part to our investigative work, automobile 
makers recalled tens of millions of vehicles, and Takata 
Corporation was sentenced last month to pay $1 billion in 
criminal penalties. NHTSA is making progress towards addressing 
our recommendations to collect and analyze more comprehensive 
vehicle safety data, but must continue to improve internal 
controls within its Office of Defects Investigations.
    With regard to stewardship, we have identified areas where 
DOT can improve how it manages and oversees the billions of 
dollars invested each year in our transportation 
infrastructure, from highways and bridges to air traffic 
control.
    For example, FAA faces ongoing challenges to deliver six 
programs that are essential to implement NextGen and modernize 
our outdated air traffic control systems. Expenditures since 
2003 for these six programs now total over $5.7 billion, and 
their completion has been pushed to well beyond 2020. As a 
watch item, many requirements remain undefined, and FAA has yet 
to fully quantify how these programs will achieve expected 
benefits for the aviation industry.
    Protecting our infrastructure also requires addressing 
increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats. However, DOT 
has not effectively implemented programs to actively monitor 
and mitigate security breaches immediately, during, or after an 
attack. Recent trends in mobile, cloud, and workplace 
technology also present new challenges to monitoring and 
securing DOT's network.
    Finally, as it carries out its mission, DOT must develop 
strategies to efficiently carry out mandated and recommended 
improvements. These include provisions in the 2015 FAST Act, to 
improve investments in highway and transit projects, as well as 
key aviation safety mandates from the 2016 FAA Extension Act. 
Those mandates include, for example, requiring better records 
on a pilot's training and background. DOT has also faced delays 
in addressing recommendations to improve pipeline and hazardous 
material safety from both our office and NTSB.
    In conclusion, my office will continue to assist DOT and 
Congress as we work to meet these and other challenges, 
including helping the department leverage its resources to 
promote safety and efficiency and prevent fraud in any 
forthcoming infrastructure investment plans.
    Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepared statement. I am 
happy to answer any questions you or other subcommittee members 
may have.
    [The information follows:]
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Thank you very much, sir. We will now 
recognize HUD's Inspector General, Mr. Montoya. Mr. Montoya, 
your full testimony also will be included in the record, and 
so, again, you are now recognized for five minutes, and thank 
you for being here, sir.
    Mr. Montoya. Thank you, sir. Chairman Diaz-Balart and 
Ranking Member Price and members of the subcommittee, thank you 
for the opportunity to discuss the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development's top management and performance challenges 
for fiscal year 2017 and beyond and the oversight my office 
conducts.
    Just this past year my office's contribution realized 
financial benefits to the government of nearly $8.5 billion, 
which represents a leading return on investment of $67 for 
every dollar spent on our work. We have a talented staff, and 
together through the years we have developed a culture of 
focusing on stewardship, accountability, and impactful 
oversight work. I want to share how proud I am of our team at 
HUD OIG and I am proud to serve them as their Inspector 
General.
    HUD's key management and performance challenges are so 
interrelated and interconnected that our reviews indicate one 
impacts another to such a degree that in many cases HUD will 
not be able to remedy one without first correcting another. 
This becomes a taxing challenge to determine which needs to 
come first or whether several need to be accomplished 
simultaneously.
    Achieving HUD's mission continues to be an ambitious 
challenge for its limited staff, given its diverse programs, 
the thousands of entities carrying them out, and the millions 
of citizens who receive benefits from them. HUD's most 
significant challenge is reflected in it struggle to establish 
and implement effective and required financial management 
governance.
    In our fiscal years 2016 and 2015 (restated) financial 
statement audit report we expressed a disclaimer of opinion due 
to HUD's inability to deliver principal financial statements in 
a timely manner and other unresolved audit matters. This marks 
3 years in a row now that HUD has been unable to receive a 
clean opinion.
    The absence of having key financial staff with appropriate 
skills, background, and knowledge to oversee the preparation of 
Federal financial statements was best illustrated when we found 
several instances where rounding was performed to the nearest 
billion and hundred billion while OMB requires the highest 
level of rounding only to the nearest million.
    The result was that HUD had to withdraw it published agency 
financial report in December of 2016 in order to correct 
material errors. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer did 
not inform my office of changes it made after it submitted 
final financial statements for our review, and left the 
impression that certain sections of its published financial 
statements had been audited by my office when they had not 
been.
    HUD and the Office of Chief Financial Officer had failed to 
design and implement an adequate system of internal controls 
over financial reporting necessary to mitigate the challenges 
and risks in its complex financial reporting process, which 
will continue to contribute to the persistence of disclaimers 
in the Department's annual financial statements for the 
foreseeable future.
    These challenges and risks were exacerbated by the 
Department's New Core project that was to have transitioned 
HUD's legacy general ledger application to an enterprise 
resource management application housed in a Federal shared 
service provider. Our audits have determined that HUD's 
transition to a shared service provider did not improve the 
handling of its financial management transactions.
    A year after the transition, HUD had inaccurate data 
resulting from the conversions and continued to execute 97 
percent of its programmatic transactions using legacy 
applications. HUD also continues to face challenges and funding 
constraints in addressing outdated information technology 
systems, its ability to integrate updated application systems, 
and replace the legacy systems.
    The use of aging systems has resulted in poor performance 
and high operation and maintenance costs, and have also 
inhibited HUD's ability to produce reliable, useful, and timely 
financial information. They also leave the Department's 
financial systems and information at increased risk of 
unauthorized access and modification.
    Ginnie Mae also continues to face challenges in its 
financial management accountability, managing counterparty 
risk, and monitoring nonbank issuers, which has grown by 
approximately 62 percent since 2010, and now represent a 
majority of issuances annually. By the end of fiscal year 2016, 
Ginnie Mae had made guarantees on loans with the remaining 
principal balance of approximately $1.7 trillion.
    In conclusion, HUD will continue to face challenges until 
it puts controls and adequate resources in place to address 
them. We remain committed, though, to working collaboratively 
with HUD and strive to provide best practices and reasonable 
recommendations that support HUD's mission and 
responsibilities.
    We also are strongly committed to working with the 
Department and the Congress to ensure that these important 
programs operate efficiently and effectively and as intended 
for the benefit of the American taxpayers now and into the 
future.
    Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony and I would be 
pleased to answer any questions you or the committee may have. 
Thank you.
    [The information follows:]
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Thank you very much, sir. We, 
obviously, have many issues to talk about and I know that a lot 
of members have questions.
    Members, we will proceed in the standard 5-minute rounds, 
alternating sides, recognizing members in order of seniority as 
they were seated at the beginning of the hearing. We will try 
to move quickly so everyone can get their questions in.
    Be mindful of your time. Obviously, the 5 minutes includes 
not only your questions, but also the answer time. And I will, 
by the way, adhere to that as well. So I will be mindful of 
that as well.
    Let me start, Inspector Montoya, with you. For several 
years now, and you mentioned it right now in your testimony, 
that your office has been--well, frankly, has had to express 
disclaimers on HUD's consolidated financial statements. Every 
Federal agency should be able to produce financial statements 
that meet audit standards, but this is, obviously, especially 
important for a financial institution like HUD.
    As simply as you can, if you can please provide the 
committee with an update on the state of financial grievances 
and governance, the governance issue at HUD, if you would?
    Mr. Montoya. I will do my best to keep it under an hour and 
a half.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. And simple, right?
    Mr. Montoya. And simple. I will do my best.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Of course.
    Mr. Montoya. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I would sort 
of roll this all up into one quick phrase and that is a failure 
of leadership at all levels. Having said that, this is a good 
example of the interdependencies and interrelationships of the 
many programs that HUD faces.
    Let us start with human capital. They do not have the 
appropriate skills, knowledge, and expertise to prepare Federal 
financial statements. That is different from budget process. 
You couple that human capital concern that HUD has had for a 
number of years, and you overlay that onto the dependency on IT 
systems that, in many cases, were never designed to handle 
financial management processes, they are aging, and you end up 
with a confluence of the problems that you see, right, lack of 
internal controls and then lack of systems that can provide the 
relevant information that they need. That is the shortest 
answer I can give you.
    With regards to the failure of leadership, I do not think 
for several administrations now there has been a real look at 
prioritizing the type of skill sets and the personnel they need 
to get to address these many issues, not only in the financial 
management internal controls area, but also in their IT, 
security, and infrastructure.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Let me try to see if I can get you to 
specifically, if you can, comment on HUD's use of internal 
controls regarding its financial statements.
    Mr. Montoya. Well, the problem with the Department is it is 
heavily siloed. So most of the financial accounting processes 
are not centered into the Chief Information Officer. They are 
basically left to the various programs, and in many cases these 
programs do not understand general accounting principles, if 
you will.
    And so often they are putting systems into place that do 
not comport with Federal financial management. And so when you 
go to roll the systems up for the financial statements, we see 
a number of areas where there are mistakes, if you will.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. You know, that is, obviously, 
extremely disappointing and it is not the first time that we 
have heard this kind of thing. It is a persistent problem at 
HUD. Now, I think most of us would agree that what makes it 
more difficult, actually more alarming, is that HUD has been 
without a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for more than 18 
months. So, you know, I do not know how an agency can deal with 
all these issues without having a qualified CFO.
    And so can you briefly discuss what is happening there, and 
also what gaps do you think HUD needs to fill to tackle some of 
these problems that you have mentioned?
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir. They have, in fact, have been 
without a CFO for quite some time. I would say that out of 
their nine senior accounting positions only two of them, at 
best, have an accounting background, let us say a certified 
public accounting type of certification. A lot of them are 
budget-related type backgrounds. But, again, that is different 
from Federal financial management. And so that is problem 
number one and goes back to my earlier statement that they do 
not understand the intricacies of the systems they oversee.
    The best example is this idea that somebody could approve 
to round to the nearest billion and hundred billion when all 
that is allowed is a million.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Yeah, that is insane.
    Mr. Montoya. So you understand how the numbers get crazy.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. That is insane.
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. And I am trying to be kind.
    Mr. Montoya. I would not disagree with you, sir. And that 
goes, again, to the lack of experience and knowledge that you 
need in a CFO's office to prepare the statements.
    I will give you an example, if you will bear with me for a 
second here. So the assistant chief financial officer for 
accounting has an MBA in finance, but that does not necessarily 
relate to the accounting principles that individual needs to 
know. So I think that would be my biggest concern is, again, 
the failure of leadership to get these positions filled and get 
them filled with the appropriate skilled staff.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. In the 14 seconds that I have, the 
fact that they have not prioritized filling the CFO position, 
to me, does it take 18 months usually?
    Mr. Montoya. I would not think so, sir. But apparently it 
has here.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Price, you are recognized, sir.
    Mr. Price. Thank you. I would like to ask both of you to 
address conflicts of interest and how your offices deal with 
them, what your responsibility is, and a couple of more 
detailed aspects of that. Of course, this is especially a 
challenge as we start a new administration, hundreds of new 
personnel come into the departments to fill important 
positions. These individuals bring experience from outside 
government.
    With that comes, of course, the risk of conflicts of 
interest. Such conflicts become a focus of Senate confirmation 
hearings, so Cabinet-level nominees. But the scrutiny, of 
course, has to go beyond that and that is where, I assume, your 
offices come in.
    So what role do the inspector general offices play in 
investigating conflicts of interest, assessing the 
effectiveness of the Department's existing processes to deal 
with conflicts of interest? How are these concerns brought to 
your attention, typically? What responsibility do you have to 
deal with them? Are you free to initiate inquiries before a 
complaint is registered? And then how do you handle potential 
conflicts of interest after a senior officer is confirmed? Do 
you proactively review ethics filings? You see where I am 
going? I would appreciate your elaborating as much of this as 
time permits.
    Mr. Scovel. Thank you, Mr. Price. Let me take a stab at it 
from the perspective of the Department of Transportation. Our 
Office of Inspector General (OIG) takes its responsibility to 
investigate allegations of conflict of interest most seriously, 
and over the years we have done so with some notable successful 
investigations and prosecutions.
    We receive allegations from many different sources, 
oftentimes through our Hotline, oftentimes through information 
that is presented by other Federal employees, frankly, to our 
field officers, our field investigative offices. And in some 
instances our field offices are colocated with other Department 
offices, and so staff get to know staff and generates that kind 
of understanding and trust so that we will come by interest 
might exist.
    Through our investigative resources we will pursue as 
quickly and as thoroughly as possible any allegation of a 
conflict that rises potentially to the level of a crime. We are 
under obligation as well, as an OIG, to inform the FBI in every 
case where public corruption--and that is one of the 
acknowledged and longstanding focuses of interest on the part 
of the FBI--where any allegation of public corruption might be 
involved. And together we will investigate these cases.
    I have referred to a couple of notable examples, one dating 
back some years now, but it involved the Deputy Administrator 
at the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), and allegations 
that she had improper business relationships with other 
associates in the industry, business and personal 
relationships.
    Much more recently than that we investigated and arrested 
and secured a conviction, with the assistance of the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in the District of New Jersey, of the number-
two Federal Highways official for the State of New Jersey. He 
was alleged to have engaged in conduct that amounted to a 
conflict of business interest between what he was supposed to 
be doing for the Department and the government and what he was 
doing on the side as well.
    We also review with the Department, and the Department has 
a standing obligation, the Department's agency ethics officials 
have a standing obligation, to refer to us any matters that 
they have questions about. And occasionally we will get 
information through those sources, too.
    So, to sum it up, sir, we take it most seriously. We have a 
proven track record. We will continue to keep our eyes open, 
and, in fact, we have a couple of inquiries open at the moment 
that I am not at liberty to discuss in a setting like this. But 
I hope I can reassure you that we do understand that to be one 
of our prime responsibilities.
    Mr. Price. Thank you. Mr. Montoya?
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, Mr. Price. We, like Inspector General 
Scovel, do take the matters seriously. We have a proven track 
record as well at looking at conflicts of interest. On several 
occasions we have found that they are unfounded and we move on. 
Several cases we have found issues.
    One in particular had to do with the deputy secretary some 
years ago on a lobbying issue. I believe in that case he was 
ill-served by the Office of Ethics for the Department. And I 
think that within the Office of Ethics in the Department I 
would not have any confidence in them, sir. They have proven 
time and time again that they do not have, I guess, the ability 
to speak truth to power, if you will, and to make the tough 
calls when necessary.
    As an example, they referred a matter to us of an ex-
employee who may be lobbying, if you will, back into the 
Department, having business with the Department that they 
should otherwise not have. When we go back to them with our 
findings and the results, because they are the ones that have 
to make the determination as to whether there has been an 
ethics violation, they do not want to make that determination 
and that troubles me that they will not want to make the 
determination.
    We had another example having to do with the interpersonal 
act, hiring appointments, where an individual from the 
regulated community was brought into the Department in a high-
level position, and the Office of Ethics was nowhere to be 
found when it came to not only this individual's financial 
disclosure reports, but talking to the Secretary and the Deputy 
Secretary about what this person should or could do while they 
were in the Department.
    Now, in fairness to them, I think any Office of Ethics 
within a department or agency should have some degree of 
organizational independence. It is that organizational 
independence, maybe not so much like an IG, but certainly some 
independence that would keep them from having concerns of fear 
of reprisal and conflicts themselves with the folks that they 
have to serve.
    I think in our case, they do not ask the relevant 
questions. They do not dig deep. They take at face value what 
the individual says and they leave it at that.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. If I may?
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir?
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Because our time has run out. But, 
Mr. Price, I think you have touched on a very important issue 
that we need to further look into. Thank you.
    Mr. Price. Yes. We will pick it up later. Thank you very 
much.
    Mr. Montoya. Absolutely. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Price. Absolutely.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Mr. Young, you are recognized, sir.
    Mr. Young. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Price, 
and my colleagues. Good morning. Gentleman, thanks for coming 
today.
    Mr. Montoya, thanks for your testimony. And the issue of 
the financial statements, the auditing, the lack of 
understanding key information that should be there, the human 
capital issue, I appreciate the chairman's attention to this 
and I know my other colleagues on both sides want to try to get 
to the bottom of this and fix this because it is a very 
frustrating situation.
    In your testimony you shared since 1991 the OIG has 
reported a lack of a integrated financial management system. 
How long have they been using the same integrated financial 
management system? And how does that dovetail with the computer 
systems as well? So you have a process and then you have, I 
guess, a product. Do they match up? Just talk a little bit 
about that.
    Mr. Montoya. So a lot of their IT systems are 15 to 30 
years old.
    Mr. Young. Okay. Wow.
    Mr. Montoya. Many of them were not designed to handle 
Federal financial management processes. That is the first 
troubling part.
    The other issue, I would say, and I have a great example 
here--well, let me talk about the fact that these problems, not 
all the IT issues, but the human capital and the financial 
management processes, are problems that are going to take years 
to correct, sustained leadership not only from Congress, but 
the administration, a commitment to really correct these 
problems. And absent any kind of a budget shortfall or cut, 
these are still things that are going to be resonating and 
still issues that they are going to have to deal with.
    Probably one of the best examples I can give you is just 
the lack of systems to handle some of these financial 
management processes. It is within the Office of Public and 
Indian Housing there is a lack of an automated process to 
complete the reconciliations required to monitor the public 
housing authorities and to ensure Federal cash, mind you, that 
is not maintained in excess of the immediate need. These 
reconciliations are prepared manually on unprotected 
spreadsheets. So for over 2,200 public housing authorities 
receiving $17 billion annually, they manage this on an Excel 
spreadsheet.
    So you can see that when we talk about implementing IT 
systems that can handle these types of accounting issues, it 
becomes very critical.
    Mr. Young. I want to get to a few of your recommendations. 
Would you recommend having an integrated technology system that 
was up to date, but as well when it comes to the human capital 
issue and the Office of the CFO, ensuring that the people 
coming in there--like you said, I think there was only 2 of the 
10 maybe had accounting backgrounds. Is that what you said?
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Young. Okay. What can Congress do to help you with 
that? To help ensure that those who are coming into those 
positions have the appropriate backgrounds. I mean, do we go as 
far as not just recommending, but mandating that those within 
that office have an accounting degree? I mean, how far do we 
go? Because we have to make this work. This is not about 
attacking HUD. This is about ensuring the taxpayer dollars are 
spent wisely and the programs are effective.
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir. Thank you. Well, to be clear, I 
think in some of these high-level positions, high-leadership 
positions, you do not necessarily have to have the accounting 
degree, but you should surround yourself with people that have 
the requisite skills. You should be willing to listen to them 
and to provide you advice and counsel.
    In the area of let us talk about Ginnie Mae, the General 
National Mortgage Association or the Government National 
Mortgage Association. They are handling a $1.7 trillion 
portfolio. By the end of the year that will be about $2 
trillion. They do not have the infrastructure, again the IT 
systems or the personnel, to handle the security processes they 
have to handle in the markets that they have to deal with every 
single day. I think in their particular case, I think Congress 
and the administration need to think about a different pay 
scale, quite frankly, not one consistent with Fannie Mae, for 
example, where the CEO makes $1 million a year, but maybe 
something on the order of what the Federal Housing Finance 
Agency or CFPB or the SEC and some of these other governmental 
agencies make in order that the salaries are high enough to 
entice the right type of personnel. Often Ginnie Mae loses good 
candidates to higher paying banks and financial institutions, 
so it is very difficult for them to compete. So that is on the 
one hand.
    On the other hand, with regard to these systems, HUD 
continues to be so heavily siloed that even within the IT 
environment and the financial environment, each program office 
could do its own thing from an accounting standpoint and an IT 
standpoint that does not relate to another office's accounting 
and IT functions, so the two do not talk. And that was one of 
the biggest problems in the New Core program that they tried to 
implement. These systems do not talk because the data is not 
the same, the systems are not the same. And so I do not know 
that New Core would have ever worked quite frankly.
    Mr. Young. This is frustrating and I imagine it frustrates 
you, too, but you are helping us get to the bottom of the human 
capital needs. The systems are not integrating together. They 
are very old as well as maybe the structure. You talked about 
all the silos, but I would like to have further conversations 
with you on this. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Thank you, sir. Mr. Aguilar.
    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member. 
Thank you, gentlemen, both for being here. Picking up on what 
my colleague was just talking about, I mean, Mr. Montoya, some 
of the key words you mentioned is something anyone who has been 
in a public financing realm never wants to hear, which is lack 
of internal controls, something that is deeply troubling. 
Specifically to follow up on what Mr. Young was saying, HUD has 
on two different occasions taken steps to implement new systems 
and it has not worked. Additionally, outsourcing data entry and 
financial management activities have raised oversight concerns 
from your office.
    Can you talk a little bit about the centralization of these 
procedures versus outsourcing some of those activities, and 
what the effect of budget reductions could do on our ability to 
deliver accurate financials in the future?
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir, Mr. Aguilar. Thank you for the 
question. With regard to internal controls, it boils down to 
the lack of policies and procedures. Now, they are getting 
better at updating their policies and procedures. These are 
accounting policies and procedures. And, yes, it has to be 
centralized in the chief financial officer position and that 
should flow then to the rest of the programs. So that is the 
biggest problem when you talk about internal controls.
    With regard to the collaboration between all these 
programs, there is difficulty there in sort of talking to each 
other before they created a separate financial management 
structure, for example, or even their IT structures. And, yes, 
it is frustrating that for years these things have been going 
on, and I will say that some of the stuff is not new. On the 
order of 23 years ago, GAO had testimony on these very same 
issues and yet we are here 23 years later talking about the 
very same things: the IT systems, the ageing systems, and some 
of the financial systems.
    That is troubling for me as an IG and that is why I make 
the statement that I think it is a failure of leadership at all 
levels, and even at the IG level, that maybe as IGs, my 
predecessors and I, have not been forceful enough and outspoken 
enough to say do we need to wait 23 more years? You have two 
financial institutions sitting with this Department, the 
Federal Housing Administration and Ginnie Mae. Together their 
portfolio is about $3 trillion. If one of those has a major 
breakdown, if you will, that is going to affect the national 
economy. And these two organizations are really not 
prioritized.
    When you talk about human capital, for example, hiring a 
CFO for Ginnie Mae is not any more important than hiring a 
typist. The president of Ginnie Mae and I had a pretty good 
relationship. We talked often. He would tell me stories where 
he wanted to pull his hair out because when he would send up a 
request to hire a chief financial officer, it took a back seat 
to whatever was in front of him in the queue: a typist, a 
general staff person. There is no prioritization to put 
everything aside and let us get the CFO hired first. After that 
person is hired, we will hire whatever else we need. That is 
the kind of stuff that is most frustrating to me, and that is a 
leadership issue. That is a basic, fundamental governance and 
management issue.
    Mr. Aguilar. With fewer resources will that get better or 
will that get worse, with fewer resources, centralization 
versus in-house work? I mean, how is that going to look?
    Mr. Montoya. You know, I do not know that it is going to 
get--I do not think the budget really has anything to do with 
it, quite frankly, sir, because whether you have everything you 
could possibly want or not, if you do not prioritize the staff, 
the systems, the processes that you need first, it does not 
really matter how much money you have, and I think they have 
shown that. They have not had this kind of a severe budget cut, 
whatever is anticipated, for years and yet they have chosen not 
to prioritize it.
    So will they prioritize it with a budget cut? I am hopeful 
because with any kind of budget cut, you really have to 
prioritize and do what is important first.
    Mr. Aguilar. Appreciate it. Mr. Scovel, I will try to get 
this out quickly to give you a little bit of time. In your 
testimony you indicated that more needs to be done to ensure 
that high-risk contracts are managed well and you also indicate 
that many of the issues with contract management could be 
avoided if the contracts were properly specified and properly 
scoped. How is DOT working to improve those specifications and 
limiting the use of high-risk contract vehicles in the future 
and what can we do to make this acquisition piece a little 
better?
    Mr. Scovel. Thank you, sir. It is a concern of ours. We 
have identified a number of issues across the Department, 
including even at the Department level. We focused a lot of our 
efforts, however, on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
and its contract practices, and we have gotten into all of that 
through our work when we are called on to review the NextGen 
Air Traffic Control Modernization Program.
    High-risk contracts, cost-reimbursable contracts, of 
course, leave the door open to a contractor billing the 
Department, excessively perhaps, for costs. We have found 
instances where the Department did not sufficiently check on a 
contractor's cost-accounting systems to ensure that the costs 
that were actually advanced by the contractor to the Department 
for reimbursement were backed up within that contractor's 
accounting system.
    With regard to sole-source contracts, particularly on the 
FAA side, those have been a consistent concern of ours. FAA 
tends to acquire a lot of proprietary technology through sole-
source contracts. That means it is locked in in future 
contracting cycles to a particular contractor. Oftentimes those 
contracts are let without conducting the sufficient market 
research and the independent government cost estimate that is 
required in order to properly let a sole-source contract.
    Mr. Aguilar. I appreciate it, Mr. Scovel. My time is up.
    Mr. Scovel. Thanks.
    Mr. Aguilar. And it is my first real hearing and I do not 
want the chairman to get upset with me.
    Mr. Scovel. I understand.
    Mr. Aguilar. So I will cut you off there and we will 
restart this.
    Mr. Scovel. Thanks. Thanks very much for your question.
    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Thank you again, Mr. Aguilar. Mr. 
Joyce, you are recognized, sir.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to follow 
up on a couple of the questions here and have you put on your 
hat of a private citizen who has all this intel as to what has 
been taking place. How do you fix those problems? You said 
money is not necessarily the issue. How do you get to the 
bottom of this and cure these issues?
    Mr. Montoya. I think just getting the right people in the 
right seats and looking at the right things.
    Mr. Joyce. That is easy to be said, but, I mean, we need to 
get down to it--we cannot continue to do the same thing year 
after year. You said you have been following through now on 30 
years of this and have the same issue. This is ridiculous.
    Mr. Montoya. So I think like many organizations, HUD in 
particular does very well at looking outward, managing its 
programs outward. They do not do a very good job at looking 
inward. And if they do not get to that soon, they might not be 
able to do their job looking outward.
    I will give you an example again where the IT systems and 
financial management accounting sort of interplay. HUD relies 
heavily on IT to deliver and manage its services throughout its 
own organization and externally.
    Mr. Joyce. One question. Are these old legacy systems that 
continue to be patched that we have invested a lot of money in, 
so, therefore, we think we should keep them versus something 
that is obviously better? I mean, you and I probably grew up 
when they had a plastic phone that you would dial and now we 
have these. Is the agency keeping up with the technology?
    Mr. Montoya. They are not. In fact, many of their systems 
cannot even be patched. Some of their systems do not even have 
application support. And the example I was going to give you 
was the Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System, TRACS as 
it is known. It satisfies the Multifamily Housing Program. It 
accounts for 78 percent of HUD's housing subsidies, about $10 
billion annually.
    And I want to quote something the Department, the staff 
folks, told us when we were doing this review, and I am going 
to quote: ``TRACS has no vendor support agreement. Therefore, 
when the old system catastrophically fails, there is no means 
to manage Housing's rental assistance programs and/or pay 
subsidy payments of approximately $9.8 billion annually.'' My 
point to that is when this thing fails--and it is not a matter 
of if, it is a matter of when--there is no manual way to get 
$10 billion out to the general public who need these funds. 
That is the kind of critical point or mass that we are at.
    And so to your question, no, some of these cannot even be 
patched anymore and some of them do not even have vendors that 
keep up with them, quite frankly.
    Mr. Joyce. Which is something that you brought up as well, 
the fact that some of these things are being allowed without 
any vetting of the people who are getting these contracts. So 
these are age-old contracts that continue to stay in place, yet 
they cannot keep up with the system that they are allegedly 
trying to maintain?
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir. I was just passed a note, 87 percent 
are past their end-of-life system. These systems, 87 percent of 
them, are past end of life. And that is the other problem 
within the Department. Yes, we are heavily reliant on 
contractors. The problem is that the Department has divested 
itself of its own internal expertise, background and 
experience, that we do not even have staff that can properly 
manage these contracts. So we do not have staff that can manage 
an IT contract from the standpoint that if an IT contractor 
says you need $1 billion over here, that we would know to say 
yes, no, or that is not $1 billion. It should be $1 million. 
And that is another concern that we keep seeing.
    And I am driving the point home with these systems because, 
again, the Department has--I think we tend to forget--has two 
financial institutions in it, and these institutions are 
reliant on the same systems that the rest of HUD is.
    Mr. Joyce. I am outraged that we would be in a position 
where you do not have an IT department that can make a judgment 
on whether or not these systems that are being implemented are 
worthwhile or even cost-effective, and there is no way to get 
to the bottom of that? I am a former prosecutor, so I am sort 
of a brass tacks guy. I want to get down to how do we fix the 
problem?
    Mr. Montoya. You know, so the CIO's position at the 
Department is a politically appointed position. The gentleman 
who was there, I have to give him credit. I think he was really 
advanced the ball, but he left. He was there 2 years and he 
leaves. So you are absent the CFO. You are absent, I think, is 
the Chief Security Officer. We are also absent the Chief 
Architect for these systems. So, again, much like in the 
financial arena and the IT arena, we are absent key staff. The 
only one that is a political appointee is the CIO, Chief 
Information Officer. The rest are careerists. So, again, even 
there we lack very critical positions being filled.
    So, again, with the lack of leadership--now look, do not 
get me wrong. The Department is made up of really hardworking, 
dedicated staff. I want to make sure we are clear about that; 
99.9 percent of them, like any environment, are hardworking, 
dedicated, and they are committed to an honorable mission. The 
problem is they are not given the tools, the resources, to do 
it well and to do it efficiently and eventually not even 
effectively when these systems break down.
    Mr. Joyce. The crazy part is that we are spending money but 
not giving them the tools that they need so they can operate in 
a 2017-2018 setting.
    I realize I have gone beyond my time, Mr. Chairman, and I 
will yield back. I guess I do not have any time to yield back.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Thank you. Ms. Clark, you are 
recognized.
    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and 
thank you to our witnesses for being here today. As part of the 
accountability, the Whistleblower Program is an important piece 
of that. Mr. Scovel, I missed that from your status update, but 
I did see, Mr. Montoya, that there has been training going on. 
Could you both update me on where that is? Are there challenges 
that you see? And do they have sufficient resources to carry 
out the mission?
    Mr. Scovel. Let me start, Ms. Clark. Thanks very much for 
the question. I appreciate your interest in this important 
topic. Whistleblowers and other insider reports are key areas 
for us to be able to explore in order to effectively protect 
the Department's programs and the taxpayer dollar.
    In our Office of Inspector General we have an individual 
whom we call our whistleblower protection ombudsman. He has 
been in charge of our whistleblower protection and the training 
within our office for a number of years now. We have a training 
effort to educate all of our OIG staff, so that should they 
come in contact with individuals who express an interest in 
perhaps revealing information and could be characterized as 
whistleblowers, that all of our staff know the procedures to 
refer them to the proper person.
    Our whistleblower ombudsman has handled several dozen cases 
during the time that he has been with us and since he has been 
appointed. Seventeen of those cases have been referred to the 
Office of Special Counsel, which has primary jurisdiction to 
investigate and resolve whistleblower complaints raised by 
Federal employees. Within our office we have got six open 
investigations currently, one involving a Federal employee, 
another five involving Federal contractors, and we have primary 
responsibility for those.
    We have closed four, and let me give you a taste of how 
those have been resolved over the last couple of years. One 
individual took our report of investigation and deemed it 
worthy of pursuit in District Court in the District of 
Columbia; another was denied at the Department level. One, we 
have determined we had no jurisdiction because the 
whistleblower allegation was lodged under the Recovery Act, and 
it turned out there were no Recovery Act dollars implicated in 
this particular contractor employee's case.
    One we substantiated; it was a whistleblower matter that 
was submitted by an employee of WMATA, the Washington 
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. He was alleging contract 
improprieties within the agency and he entered into settlement 
negotiations and, in fact, resolved the case and received a 
settlement from WMATA based on that.
    Ms. Clark. Do you see any challenges specifically to this 
program?
    Mr. Scovel. We do, most certainly. The whistleblower 
protection ombudsman is a specific designation that we are 
required to have only through November, I believe, of this 
year. We would consider it an important designation to maintain 
by law. We are prepared to do it, notwithstanding a 
requirement. So, we will continue it in our office because we 
deem it that important.
    However, we find that we are strapped for resources. We 
have one attorney investigator who not only doubles as our 
whistleblower ombudsman, but also as an investigator for some, 
if not most, of the matters alleged in these whistleblower 
communications.
    So, should we have more resources? Of course we could do 
more. In the meantime, I am reasonably satisfied that we are 
doing all we can with what we have got.
    Ms. Clark. Great. Thank you. Mr. Montoya, I wanted to talk 
to you in my remaining time, about some of what you highlighted 
in your report of September 30th about prosecuting civil fraud. 
Specifically with financial institutions there is quite a list: 
Wells Fargo, 1.2 billion; Freedom Mortgage, 133 million; seven 
major cases.
    It does not look like it is the first time that you have 
gone after some of these bad actors. How many financial 
institutions have been debarred from participating in HUD 
programs since 2008?
    Mr. Montoya. Thank you for your question, Ms. Clark. I do 
not believe any have been debarred from doing business with the 
Department or FHA.
    Ms. Clark. And is there a reason why? Is that part of your 
calculus with disbarment, is repeated violations?
    Mr. Montoya. Well, it certainly could be, that is actually 
up to the Department to make a determination as to whether that 
would happen; highly unlikely. You know, many of these failures 
are, if you will, lack of appropriately ensuring that folks 
could actually pay for these loans occurred years and years 
ago, and I think a lot of that conduct has really changed over 
the last 5 years.
    So, could that have happened 5 years ago? Maybe. I think it 
would be highly unusual to debar a bank or an institution that 
could otherwise, you know, provide mortgages to low- to 
moderate-income families. I think, in fairness to the 
Department, we work jointly with them, with the Department, my 
office and the Department of Justice, to address these issues. 
I think the Department took it seriously. But again, yeah, it 
would be a question for the Department, whether they actually 
ever considered debarment.
    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Diaz-Balart. Thank you. Before I recognize Mr. 
Valadao, let me announce I am going to have to be in a markup 
on budget on the Health Care Act. So, I am going to ask the 
vice chairman if he could take over.
    And with that, I recognize the distinguished gentleman from 
California, Mr. Valadao.
    Mr. Valadao. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Montoya, I 
understand your office published an audit back in July 2015, 
which concluded that over-income tenants blatantly abused the 
public housing system. It has been reported that thousands of 
people across the country receiving HUD benefits despite 
earning incomes greater than the eligibility threshold. The 
audit report also indicated with more than 300,000 qualified 
families that are stuck on waiting lists.
    For example, I am aware of cases in my own district in 
which families making over $100,000 were receiving public 
assistance from HUD. Audits like these provide HUD the 
opportunity to reevaluate policies and initiatives, make 
improvements to take sufficient steps to reduce abuse such as 
over-income families in public housing.
    Can you please describe steps HUD has taken to negate 
flagrant abuse by tenants who make more than the low-income 
threshold?
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Valadao, for the 
question. Well, yeah, so the subject our work took on, not only 
a lot of public interest, but obviously a lot of congressional 
interest, and legislation was passed unanimously about a year 
ago. It was called the Housing Opportunity Through 
Modernization Act, and it requires public housing authorities 
to evict over-income families after 2 consecutive years of 
exceeding applicable income limitations. The key will be the 
oversight that HUD provides to that process and whether public 
housing authorities are actually doing it.
    It is unfortunate, but the Department really does not have 
the resources to provide that level of oversight. We, at some 
point, will probably come in some several years later to do a 
follow-up audit or evaluation to see if we find any extreme 
outliers. But really it is going to fall to the Department to 
provide that oversight.
    Mr. Valadao. So, my next question then is to Mr. Scovel. In 
2015, Congress passed the FAST Act, the largest transportation 
package in more than a decade. With the FAST Act it was 
reported that the inspector general submit an assessment to the 
Department of Transportation on the impact of delays, and the 
pick up and delivery of goods by motor carriers and drivers. To 
my knowledge the report has not been submitted to the 
Department of Transportation.
    Do you know when the Department will have the ``Delays in 
Goods Movement Report'' completed to submit to the 
Transportation Committee? And do you mind providing this 
Committee with an estimated timeframe for the completion?
    Mr. Scovel. Yes, sir. In fact, I may be able to answer all 
aspects of your question right now. The Department, as 
required, did complete its study--I am sorry, you were 
referring to a study on freight delays?
    Mr. Valadao. Yes.
    Mr. Scovel. Yes. I am sorry. I mistook your question for 
one regarding hours of service for motor carriers. I do not 
have a timeframe for you on the freight delay study. I 
understand that we will be auditing it, and we will be happy to 
follow up with more information to you and your staff when we 
have that available.
    Mr. Valadao. Okay. And then on the hours of service, you 
were going to say?
    Mr. Scovel. Yes. I was going to say that in the 
Appropriations Act, the Department's imposition of suspended 
hours of service for motor carrier drivers, the Department was 
required to conduct a study, and then, in the meantime, suspend 
the imposition of those aspects of the rules, often called the 
restart provisions of the rule.
    That study was completed. My office was required under the 
Appropriations Act to certify, in effect, the methodology that 
was used in the study. We did that. We completed that review 
and communicated to both the Congress and the Secretary on 
March 2nd that the study had met all requirements.
    The Secretary, I believe, has already submitted her report 
to the Congress. If not, then it should happen any day, because 
that matter had been in her office the last we were informed. 
Thanks.
    Mr. Valadao. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you very much, Mr. Valadao. There is no 
time to yield back, but that is fine; just kidding. Starting, I 
hate to be rude, but I guess I'll start this round and then we 
will continue to go through the questions.
    Inspector Montoya, first, both of you gentlemen, I notice 
your lovely green ties, so thank you for keeping it in honor of 
St. Patrick's Day; my birthday, too.
    As you know Ginnie Mae has had problems with tracking and 
hiring staff that have the right skill sets to perform mission-
critical jobs. What are the effects of not having employees 
with the necessary skills in Ginnie Mae's financial accounting 
management and overall management capacity?
    Mr. Montoya. Well, sir, I think the first problem you see 
is disclaimers of audit opinions, and so that is the first 
part.
    The second part is that, you know, with these nonbanks that 
they are starting to see a huge influx of, there is really no 
oversight body to them. Maybe the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, but there is not an oversight body like you would have 
like if it was a bank.
    These nonbanks are not capitalized as a bank would be, and 
so it is going to be incumbent upon Ginnie Mae to do that 
oversight. If they do not have the appropriate accounting 
skills, financial-type background, it is going to be even more 
difficult for them to do the proper oversight of these 
nonbanks. And so those are two areas where I think it could be 
very detrimental to Ginnie Mae.
    Mr. Joyce. Following up on that, is it a significant issue 
that individuals with the necessary skill sets are extremely 
well paid in the private sector, so it becomes nearly 
impossible for Ginnie Mae to compete. What would make the 
agency more competitive?
    Mr. Montoya. Well, as I stated earlier, sir, I think what 
would make it more competitive is that the Department, the 
administration, and Congress get together to consider a 
different pay structure for at least Ginnie Mae. And by that I 
am not even advocating for all of Ginnie Mae employees, and 
they have got about 140, but there is a small cadre that you 
could probably look at that are paid a higher salary.
    And again, consistent with other Federal agencies, like the 
Federal Finance Housing Agency, CFPB, even makes a higher 
salary. So, consistent with that, it gives you a little bit 
more latitude, if you will, to attract folks.
    Mr. Joyce. With a portfolio of 1.7 trillion in outstanding 
principal balance, Ginnie Mae is a big and important financial 
institution, needless to say. What are the potential 
consequences if they do not get their financial house in order?
    Mr. Montoya. Well, we saw it in the case of TBW when they 
had to take over these portfolios when these organizations, you 
know, tank, in essence. They do not have the infrastructure to 
handle that. So if you get a lot of these issuers that cannot 
do what they need to, well, Ginnie Mae is guaranteed that there 
is--you know, through the good faith and credit of the U.S., 
you know, that these payments are going to be made. That means 
they have got to take it on, they have got to service, they 
have got to operate these things. They do not have that 
infrastructure. Without that you have major problems.
    And they do have contractors, they use a lot of 
contractors. In fact, most of the work is done by contractors. 
But therein lies, still, the problem with the lack of actual 
onboard expertise. They do not have the proper skills to 
oversee the contractors who are overseeing all these things 
that need to be overseen.
    Mr. Joyce. Yes. I would like to recognize Ranking Member 
Price.
    Mr. Price. Thank you. I actually want to continue this line 
of questioning, but first I want to return briefly to the 
previous discussion of conflicts of interests and ethics. I am 
impressed with the testimony both of you gave as to the 
authority and responsibility you have to pursue conflicts of 
interest at all levels. Especially caught my attention, Mr. 
Montoya, with your comments about the disabilities of the 
Ethics Office within HUD. You are responsible for overseeing 
that office for making those critiques public inside and 
outside the agency. You have the ability to be proactive and I 
take it you have the ability and the responsibility to do a 
post-confirmation review of the ethics filings of senior 
officials. All of those things true?
    Mr. Montoya. No, we do not do a post review of the filings 
of the ethics official per se.
    Mr. Price. What would it take to trigger such oversight?
    Mr. Montoya. Well, we have an allegation of a conflict of 
interest.
    Mr. Price. An allegation from some credible source of a 
conflict of interest?
    Mr. Montoya. Right. So, for example, in the matter where 
they hired somebody through an IPA that really should not have 
been there, at that point, we asked for this information. The 
irony there is they had not made or produced it.
    Mr. Price. All right, fine. Let me turn to this line of 
questioning having to do with financial management. Mr. 
Montoya, you cited over two decades of challenges in this 
regard and you provided a rather generic explanation, failure 
of leadership. It seems to me if you have got two decades of 
failures of leadership, you might look beyond that. And 
actually, the more you talk, the more I think you have, in 
fact, looked beyond that, that that generic explanation may not 
be your entire explanation because you are citing the ability 
to attract and compensate and motivate first-rate personnel.
    This Ginnie Mae case seems like a case in point. So if 
administration after administration, if decade after decade you 
are observing a failure of leadership, it looks like you 
certainly want to scratch beneath that generic explanation and 
see if there are systemic or system problems that make 
leadership difficult or impossible as you define it.
    So that takes me to the Ginnie Mae case. And you have just 
talked about what I take to be an overreliance, certainly a 
heavy reliance, on third-party contractors to perform key 
functions, the inability inside the agency to oversee those 
contracts. You have cited the pay structure that makes it hard 
to attract the right kinds of employees and to have them 
exercise authority effectively.
    It is hard to imagine that a budget like we have seen in 
the last 24 hours or a hiring freeze makes any of this easier. 
You say it is not budgetary, but surely budget and personnel 
cuts of a drastic sort do not help. I do not understand your 
statement that this is not, in any way, budgetary. So you see 
where I am coming from in terms of wishing you to elaborate. 
Give us a little fuller, more satisfying explanation.
    And then, Mr. Scovel, if we have time, I would like for you 
to--I assume DOT does not have problems of this magnitude. I 
would like to have your attempting to compare here what maybe 
is going right or at least differently in that agency. But, Mr. 
Montoya.
    Mr. Montoya. At some point, somebody has got to make these 
decisions that you are going to find the right people to put 
them in the right place, in the right seat. You are going to 
look at those things that are a priority to the Department, and 
that is what I am getting at. Yes, we have done a lot of 
behind-the-scenes reviews, audits, investigations. We relate 
that to the Department through our recommendations for best 
practices. I will give you the best example I have.
    In the first 3 years I was at the Department, we had maybe 
six or seven disagreements with the Department senior 
leadership. Eventually, we were able to figure those out and 
come to some resolution. So these things never went to the 
Deputy Secretary for a decision, i.e., where she is playing--
you know, having to make a decision between us as the IG and 
the assistant secretary for the program.
    In the last 2 years, with the prior administration, 
particularly the Deputy Secretary, those skyrocketed to 16 
disagreements. And in those occasions, really what it related 
to was an atmosphere that was created that was to not listen to 
the IG, they do not have anything to provide, and many of these 
recommendations went to these core management and performance 
challenges that I am talking to. So when you have leadership 
who fails to see that these recommendations are going to 
hopefully help them and yet they discount them out of turn, 
that is troubling to me.
    As I have often said, as IGs, we are not there to make 
those Departments look bad. We are part of those Departments. 
It is our job to help them succeed. It is our job to help them 
reach their mission assignments and their responsibilities, not 
the opposite. And there was a culture created for the last 2 
years that was to not trust the IG. Slow them down as much as 
you can. I had to, on several occasions, I had to threaten to 
come to Congress with 7-day letters because there was a failure 
of cooperation, failure to give us the documentation we needed 
to do our audits, our investigations. If it had not been for 
the Secretary and his team to come in to say to the Deputy 
Secretary, no, you will give them that information, we would 
not have done it. We would have had to come to Congress.
    So listen, I want to credit publicly Secretary Castro for 
honoring his commitment when he signed a joint letter with me 
that his staff would cooperate with our office. But if not for 
him, the Deputy Secretary would have allowed these things to 
basically go by the wayside. That is what I mean by a failure 
of leadership.
    Mr. Price. My time has expired. We will return to this. 
Thank you for elaborating that.
    The question remains, though, given stellar leadership or 
outstanding leadership, what kind of measures, what kind of 
policies are required here? And, of course, we need to get to 
that as well. That is where I think this Ginnie Mae case is 
troubling and, at least for me and I think many others, raises 
questions about the wisdom of such across-the-board measures as 
hiring freezes. And certainly, the kind of budget cuts we are 
looking at here, that pertains, by the way, to your own offices 
and the kind of ability you are going to have to perform your 
functions as well, of course, as Ginnie Mae and other offices 
who have these severe management challenges. So we will return 
to this. Thank you.
    Mr. Montoya. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Ranking Member Price. And I think I 
speak on behalf of this whole committee that if you feel 
compelled that you need our help at any time, come before this 
committee. With that, I recognize Member Young.
    Mr. Young. Thank you, sir. Mr. Scovel, I want to talk about 
unmanned aerial aircraft systems, what we call drones commonly. 
You released a report in December 2016, finding that the FAA 
has not established a comprehensive oversight framework for the 
use of drones overseeing the UAS industry. Can you share some 
of the key recommendations from this report and what, if any, 
steps are being done to implement those findings?
    Mr. Scovel. Yes, thank you, sir. Key area, it is one of--
probably the top one in terms of emerging technologies that 
keeps me awake at night; a significant safety threat, as anyone 
who flies can appreciate.
    FAA is working, in my view, deliberately in an effort to 
integrate Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the national 
airspace. A key part of that will need to be developing this 
comprehensive oversight framework that we mentioned in our 
report. And by way of oversight framework we would start first 
with consolidated data, relevant data, that right now is spread 
between three different offices within FAA. It is not 
integrated, it is not analyzed comprehensively; it is spread 
between different silos within FAA to the detriment, we think, 
of the Agency's ability to understand the threat to safety 
posed by UAS and also to deal with it.
    Mr. Young. Are they moving on that recommendation about 
consolidating their data, do you know?
    Mr. Scovel. They have agreed, but they are holding off. 
They have a target action date and they are working to 
complete, I understand. However, I think that within the minds 
of many there is a question mark related to what will happen 
should air traffic control be separated from FAA proper.
    Right now, responsibility for UAS integration is spread 
between the Air Traffic Organization, ATO--the safety 
organization that is separate from but also within FAA, of 
course--and then there is a UAS Integration Office. All three 
of those entities are responsible for collecting some data, but 
it is not all integrated. Some of those entities may remain 
within FAA should air traffic control be separated.
    Mr. Young. Do you know if in your findings, 
recommendations, and within the folks at FAA looking at this, 
if they are taking into account proprietary information by 
private citizens? Particularly in agriculture, we have a lot of 
farmers and producers who use drones, UASs, for many reasons, 
and I am just wondering regarding that proprietary information 
and privacy if that is being addressed.
    Mr. Scovel. Yes, FAA does not have a primary responsibility 
for privacy, that is, you know, in the classic sense of a drone 
hovering over your backyard or whatever the nature of the 
perceived intrusion might be. However, FAA has agreed with the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration that 
has, by designation of President Obama at the time, primary 
responsibility to develop a Government-wide framework regarding 
privacy concerns--to address privacy concerns.
    The role that FAA has taken on for itself has been that of 
education. So when applicants register their UAS with FAA, they 
receive a packet regarding privacy and the best practices 
there.
    The other aspect that you mentioned, sir, specifically with 
regard, say, to precision agriculture and other specific uses, 
FAA--and I do want to give them good credit for this--FAA has 
undertaken stakeholder communication and collaboration most 
diligently, and it has a Drone Advisory Committee, for 
instance, that is helping the Agency understand better how to 
integrate beyond--what is called in the industry and the 
Agency--beyond line-of-sight operations, which would include 
many agricultural applications as well. That is a key area that 
both industry and the Agency realize they need to focus on. 
There need to be some technological improvements in order to 
facilitate that.
    Mr. Young. Well, that is encouraging.
    Mr. Scovel. But they are keyed onto it.
    Mr. Young. That is encouraging because it is always good, I 
think, when you take into account who this affects and the 
opinions and needs, wants, comments of the stakeholders.
    My time is about up, Mr. Chairman, but will there be a 
third round?
    Mr. Joyce. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Young. Thank you.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Young. The Chair recognizes Ms. 
Clark.
    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to follow up on 
a point from our ranking member. And as we are looking at 
conflicts of interest, as we are looking at personnel issues, I 
think, Mr. Montoya, your testimony was that 43 percent of HUD 
career permanent employees will be eligible to retire by 2019. 
What is the impact of a blanket hiring freeze?
    Mr. Montoya. Well, there certainly will be an impact with a 
blanket hiring freeze because it goes back to my concerns that 
they then are very limited in who they can hire and, of course, 
it slows the process down in hiring some of these key roles and 
positions they need to fill. With regards to the retirements, 
the troubling part there is much of the expertise that the 
Department currently holds will leave with it. And that goes 
again to what limited staff we do have to provide the contract 
oversight, if you will, and the financial management governance 
side and the IT side will be gone and so we will even have less 
internal. So from the standpoint of making sure the Department 
has it right with the limited hires they will get, assuming 
they get any, they have got to make the right hires and they 
have got to prioritize those hirings.
    Ms. Clark. I also want to go back to our discussion about 
disbarment. And in your testimony you raised that HUD is often 
hesitant to take strong enforcement actions against lenders 
because it has a competing mandate to continue FHA's role in 
restoring the housing market. Do you believe this is part of 
why we have not seen financial institutions with multiple 
violations being disbarred? And if so, what kind of 
recommendations do you have around this tension between the 
mission of HUD?
    Mr. Montoya. So that is probably a question best for HUD. 
Whether that is their reasoning, it certainly could be. With 
regards to the tension, you know----
    Ms. Clark. But that was your testimony, right, you do 
believe that?
    Mr. Montoya. Oh, yes, I do.
    Ms. Clark. Yeah.
    Mr. Montoya. I do believe that. But with regards to why 
they do not disbar, I think part of that is, you know you do 
not--and in fairness, they do not really want to lock down the 
economy. They do not want to lock down the ability for people 
to get homes. You just want----
    Ms. Clark. But even if we took disbarment away, if we are 
just looking at repeated violations and pursuing those----
    Mr. Montoya. Right.
    Ms. Clark [continuing]. Do you think that would be--is 
there a way to address this tension that might ease that 
problem?
    Mr. Montoya. So they do have an MRB, a board that is 
supposed to look at these actors who continuously do these 
things. And at that level, they can impose financial penalties, 
they can disbar at that level. And so they do have a mechanism 
outside of a civil case, for example, the DOJ, to take strong 
enforcement. Often it is very weak.
    We did some work on that, on the MRB, the Mortgagee Review 
Board, about 10 or 12 years ago. I have asked my staff to do 
another review. But even back then, we saw very weak penalties 
were doled out even for some of the most egregious things; very 
low penalties, if any. Usually they will walk away with a slap 
on the hand. And, again, I think that goes to they are really 
reticent to try to do the carrot and the stick. You know, they 
are there as regulator, encouragers, you know, open up the 
market.
    Ms. Clark. Yeah.
    Mr. Montoya. But they also have that role of overseer to 
say, well, look, yes, we want you to open up the market, we 
want you to provide, you know, loans for housing, but we do not 
want you to defraud us in the process. So there has got to be 
that balance and, unfortunately, they lack a lot of that stick 
side. Right? They leave it to me in a lot of ways to do that.
    Ms. Clark. All right, thank you. I want to get a quick 
question in for Mr. Scovel about the Merchant Marine Academy 
and the sexual harassment and assault. You said in your 
testimony they had completed 29 of the 44 action items 
suggested in the 2014-15 action plan. Can you give me an 
update?
    Mr. Scovel. Still working on the remaining items, Ms. 
Clark. As we informed the committee, and we have also worked 
with the Department and the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and 
the Academy on these, the 42 action items were those that had 
been identified by the Academy itself as a result of its last 
full-fledged survey of students. The Academy had made good 
progress on those, and we reported to this committee back in 
August that they had completed 29 in our view. They claimed 
credit for having completed a few more. We pointed out that, in 
our view and reasonably, their count could not be accurate, and 
they ended up fully agreeing with us.
    I think they are completely focused on those areas that 
demand the most attention and that is, to use Inspector General 
Montoya's terms, proper leadership at the top, continued 
engagement at that level, incident reporting. The last survey 
from the 2014/2015 time period indicated a completely 
unrealistic number of reported incidents compared to those 
students who, in an anonymous survey, had reported instances of 
sexual harassment themselves. That and coordination with the 
industry on the Sea Year program where cadets from the Academy 
are especially vulnerable when they take their many months at 
sea with the shipping industry. Working with the industry on 
that and also preparing cadets for that Sea Year experience, 
the school realizes that those are the key elements that will 
bring them to success. Important area, of course, especially 
this week in light of testimony from the Marine Corps over on 
the Hill, so, you know, the services themselves are wrestling 
with it.
    Just yesterday I saw a media report that the other service 
academies, too, had reported an increase in reports of sexual 
harassment as well. So the Merchant Marine Academy knows that 
it has still a lot of work to do, but I am confident that they 
are focused in the right directions.
    Ms. Clark. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Joyce. Ms. Clark. Mr. Aguilar.
    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Nice tie. Happy 
birthday, again.
    Mr. Scovel, your testimony notes that more than $6 billion 
was spent in contracts annually for fiscal years 2015/2016. 
Specifically, you note that cost-reimbursable contracts may be 
considered high risk because contractors are paid whether work 
is completed or not. We have also heard examples where the 
product delivered by a vendor may have included services not 
designed within the contract or needed by the Department of 
Transportation. This may result in additional costs to the 
overall completion of the project.
    So my question is, does the DOT have a mapping tool that 
tracks in real time the progress infrastructure projects are 
making toward completing the work required within the Federal 
grant process--Federal contract process? And if not, are there 
standards in place to collect information that could be used to 
aggregate this tool utilized by the agency? I believe that 
mapping tools that organize and display the progress of these 
infrastructure projects across the country can support the 
agency's efforts better and help them manage assets and 
investments.
    Mr. Scovel. Absolutely, and I would entirely agree. I think 
you are right, those are critical tools in order to ensure 
success for the Department's mission.
    I would distinguish between those aspects of the 
Department's funds that are allocated to grants and the 
individual operating administrations, especially the Federal 
Transit Administration (FTA) and Federal Highways. While they 
do track or map their grants within their divisions, in the 
case of Federal Highways that would be 52, so each State is its 
own--has its own division and office under Federal Highways, 
plus the District and Puerto Rico. I would need to get back to 
you to see how far Federal Highways' headquarters is on 
integrating and comprehensively analyzing, across the Nation, 
how all of those particular grants might map out. But I do know 
that division-by-division they are tracked and followed through 
that tool.
    The Federal Transit Administration is organized by region. 
They do attempt to do the same thing. We have worked in the 
past with the Federal Transit Administration at the 
headquarters level to try to identify best practices between 
its regions on how they can track and monitor and assess the 
progress of their grants. And FTA has made pretty good progress 
in that area.
    Mr. Aguilar. So you can work with them on best practices, 
but it is really left up to each office as to how they 
administer?
    Mr. Scovel. Most certainly, but that has been a consistent 
theme with us when we have audited both FTA and Federal 
Highways. And that would be greater oversight at the 
headquarters level of what the division offices are doing 
within Federal Highways; what the regional offices are doing 
within Federal Transit to ensure greater consistency and better 
understanding at the headquarters and the Secretary level, and 
at the congressional level, of what those two operating 
administrations are doing.
    The $6 billion figure, sir, that we cited in our written 
testimony has to do with contracts that are let by the 
Department as opposed to grants. And it is that cost-
reimbursable aspect that we highlighted by way of finding some 
particular audit that we completed as posing a particular 
danger, a special danger to the Department. And the Department 
has agreed with our recommendations on that and is making some 
progress in executing on those.
    Mr. Aguilar. I appreciate it. Mr. Montoya, by statute, FHA 
is required to maintain a capital ratio of 2 percent or more in 
the reserve fund. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the capital 
ratio was 2.07 and 2.32. It is projected that the fund will 
continue to be above the threshold limit. President Obama 
issued guidance to lower the FHA premiums, partly because the 
FHA Reserve Fund achieved the capital ratio that surpassed its 
legally required threshold 2 years in a row.
    On January 20th, President Trump suspended the guidance and 
eliminated the opportunity for homeowners to take advantage of 
the lower FHA premiums. Does the OIG have any data to 
demonstrate that increasing FHA premiums is necessary to 
maintain the 2 percent capital ratio threshold in the FHA 
Reserve Fund?
    Mr. Montoya. Well, we do not have any data, per se. I think 
what we have looked at with regards to the actuarial report is 
they seem to be on track, assuming nothing goes wrong in the 
mortgage market, to continue to add to that MMI Fund. You know, 
our concern is that the Department does not make decisions that 
could negatively impact it. We have an ongoing body of work 
that we were in major disagreement with the Department having 
to do with down payment assistance and the fact that mortgages 
are being given to low- to moderate-income families with very 
high interest rates. And if those homeowners cannot eventually 
afford those higher interest rates, if we have a downturn in 
the market, you could have defaults. So it is really incumbent 
upon FHA itself to make the right decisions on risk versus 
reward, and we understand they have got to do that.
    In this particular case, our disagreement is that we think 
they are in violation of the Housing Act in allowing these sort 
of what we call borrower-funded down payments to occur and so 
sometimes FHA can be its own worst enemy. But what we know now 
with regards to our review of the actuarial is that they are 
above the threshold and they seem to be on track to continue to 
add to that.
    Mr. Aguilar. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Aguilar. And here we are at the 
end of the second round and we recognize Mr. Dent.
    Mr. Dent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning.
    Mr. Scovel, I would like to ask you just a question on MAP-
21. On March 6th, your office issued an audit report on DOT's 
progress in implementing initiatives under MAP-21, which are 
designed to accelerate project delivery. While the report 
detailed certain initiatives that had a low level of State 
participation, during your office's examination of this issue, 
were there any programs that you found that had a high level of 
State participation?
    And two, if Congress is going to be considering a 
transportation infrastructure package at some point in the near 
future, it would be helpful to understand what programs may be 
working to expedite project timelines so that Congress can, you 
know, best direct its efforts and ensure that any resources 
provided for infrastructure have a real and immediate impact. I 
think that is one of the frustrations we have all seen with 
infrastructure, that we are not in the 1930s and the 1950s 
anymore. When we said we were going to go build a road, we used 
to go out and build it, and now we spend a hell of a lot of 
time and money on preconstruction activities and we do not have 
a whole lot of stimulative effect because there is not much 
shovel-ready. So have at it.
    Mr. Scovel. Okay, thanks, sir. Yes, we did recently 
release--very recently release--our audit report to fulfill our 
obligation in the act to audit the progress or the successes 
under Subtitle C of MAP-21. This had to do specifically with a 
thought that shifting responsibility from Federal Highways 
especially to the States--should they decide to take it for 
environmental reviews--might, in fact, speed things up. While I 
think to most laymen it would make sense, for many of us, we 
see the requirement for an environmental review to be a 
significant showstopper.
    In fact, I was rather surprised that our audit report did 
not substantiate my supposition. And that is because, 
generally, the States declined to accept the invitation, if you 
will call it that, to take from Federal Highways the 
responsibility to conduct these environmental reviews for a 
number of reasons. Primarily, there was no financial incentive 
for them. Many States are resource- and budget-strapped at this 
point. Some States identified to us--when we questioned why 
not, you know, you might be able to get your projects underway 
sooner--they said, well, our lawyers are telling us that we 
will be required to waive sovereign immunity, which we are 
loath to do because we know that in many of these instances, we 
are going to get sued.
    So one State especially stood out as an example of being 
willing to take that step, and that was the State of Texas. And 
they indicated to us that they were willing and the legislature 
was willing to waive sovereign immunity, and it required an act 
of the legislature, of course. And furthermore, they considered 
their budget picture and resource-staffing picture to be 
sufficient to allow them to take it on. They did. They achieved 
some successes in moving some projects a little bit quicker 
than others, developing some innovative approaches on other 
projects, but the other States that we questioned did more 
detail. Oregon, Georgia, Pennsylvania was one, they tended to 
hang back, so we would characterize it very much a mixed bag.
    I do not know that there is any particular silver bullet, 
frankly, to make a huge progress in accelerating projects. The 
changing nature from project to project, State to State, and 
what resources the States are able to develop make it difficult 
to say that there is any universal method to achieving 
accelerated project delivery that would be the hope for all of 
us.
    Mr. Dent. Well, thank you. And I would like to turn to Mr. 
Montoya. On January 20th, your office issued a report that 
found HUD program participants may be receiving multiple 
subsidies through both multifamily housing programs and Public 
and Indian Housing programs. And according to these findings, 
you provided recommendations for HUD to address these issues. 
These recommendations required public housing agencies to 
better utilize the Enterprise Income Verification system, which 
contains resident information. Given the constrained fiscal 
climate in which we are operating, it is imperative that all 
appropriated funds are put to qualified and proper uses.
    Could you tell us if, one, if HUD has begun to implement 
the recommendations in your report to prevent future waste? And 
two, if your office believes there are any other areas where 
HUD could prevent duplicative awards by utilizing information 
or verification systems that are readily available to them? And 
my time is almost up.
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, Mr. Dent. Thank you for the question. I 
would have to get back to you on whether they have actually 
implemented or are working on the recommendations. I think 
other areas where there is duplication of benefits is the 
Disaster Program, and that is really not only within the 
Department, but as it relates to SBA and FEMA money. We are 
doing a body of work in that arena to see where there might be 
duplications of benefits and maybe where there could be some 
legislation that could help correct that.
    Mr. Dent. Thank you. I see my time has expired.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Dent. We will start on the third 
round of questions and continue on as long as the committee 
people have questions to ask. I will start off myself.
    Mr. Scovel, one of the things that has troubled me is the 
local metropolitan transit system, WMATA. Incidents this year 
included a track fire, a derailment, a flooded station, and 
one-day emergency shutdown of the entire system. These 
incidents have unveiled a massive extent of disarray to WMATA's 
infrastructure and repair process.
    Additionally, it was announced that nearly half of the 
Track Inspection Department is under review, discipline, 
suspension, or at risk of being fired after investigation into 
the July 29th derailment at East Falls Church suggested it was 
a widely accepted practice within the department to complete 
reports for inspections that had not been performed.
    In light of these developments, I am curious what 
recommendations your office has, if any, to WMATA that would 
help ensure the safety of the riders, the cost-effective use of 
taxpayers' dollars in repair efforts, and that these projects 
are completed in a timely and efficient manner?
    Mr. Scovel. Thanks, sir. This is a significant question for 
all of us in the Washington area and has broader implications 
for transit agencies across the country, of course. Our office 
has not undertaken any specific review of WMATA proper. WMATA 
has its own Office of Inspector General and for that reason and 
others, we have not looked at WMATA. I can say that GAO, 
however, was asked by Congress to look at WMATA's specific 
implementation of its current SafeTrack effort and recently 
reported out and recommended to WMATA that it engage in far 
better project management practices than it had undertaken when 
it first initiated the SafeTrack surge.
    As I understand it, WMATA's reply was, yes, but we felt we 
were under the gun for significant safety challenges and we 
wanted to get started; realizing that, of course, we had not 
completed every mark on the checklist by way of project 
management expertise, but we will get to it.
    Where our office, where DOT OIG has focused our efforts has 
been on FTA's oversight of transit agencies, and specifically 
with regard to WMATA, the process by which FTA decided to 
exercise its recently granted safety oversight authority that 
came to that Agency from 2012 legislation. We issued an audit 
report immediately upon enactment and suggested to FTA that it 
may wish to consider a number of best practices that we had 
gleaned from regular audits of other safety oversight agencies. 
FTA had embarked on that, had been making pretty good progress 
in our estimation. However, then it had to pull the trigger and 
assume direct safety oversight of WMATA itself.
    We initiated another audit and have completed that one that 
reported that FTA, in exercising that safety oversight 
authority, had a number of challenges. One had to do with 
staffing. Did it have the right expertise and the right number 
of staff to enable it to do that?
    The other was, what kind of data was it collecting? It is 
not going to be able to focus its efforts without the right 
data.
    The final one was oftentimes, as in the case of WMATA, FTA 
will be pulled into a direct oversight role, but it has to have 
a way to pull out. It needs to have an exit strategy too, which 
it had not been able to do sufficiently at the time we 
conducted our audit with regard to WMATA itself.
    So that is the area where our office has been working with 
FTA and indirectly with WMATA on its current woes.
    Mr. Joyce. Well, it would appear it is a tetra-headed 
monster, if you will. All the different agencies that are 
involved, but no one really claiming oversight----
    Mr. Scovel. Mm-hmm.
    Mr. Joyce [continuing]. Or taking it--and that there are 
too many people on the Metro rail every single day with 
potential for disaster. Do you believe in its current structure 
WMATA is internally equipped to efficiently manage and execute 
the necessary repairs?
    Mr. Scovel. Clearly, room for improvement, and I would cite 
the GAO report in that, particularly with regard to SafeTrack. 
This is the most significant rehabilitation effort that this 
transit agency has ever undertaken. GAO found some noteworthy 
areas where the planning and execution could be far better 
achieved. It is up now to the board of directors and to the 
chief executive officer to put those into play. We can see--and 
I ride Metro myself, every single day. We can see how it is 
working out and not working out over the course of SafeTrack. 
Clearly, WMATA has a ways to go.
    Mr. Joyce. Well, I hope you continue to ride in a safe 
fashion.
    Mr. Scovel. Thanks.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you. Moving now to Ranking Member Price.
    Mr. Price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Scovel, I belatedly 
have consulted your resume here, and note the bachelor's degree 
from UNC-Chapel Hill and the law degree from Duke University. 
As a former Marine, I assume you have a more courageous answer 
to this question than I do as to who you root for in ACC 
tournaments.
    Mr. Scovel. Oh, absolutely, and I appreciate the question, 
sir. And thank you for your able representation of the Triangle 
Area. It is going to be Carolina all the way.
    Mr. Price. That is a more courageous answer, yes.
    Mr. Dent. Villanova.
    Mr. Scovel. I love Duke. When they are not playing 
Carolina, Duke is my team, but when they are going head to 
head, it is Carolina, so.
    Mr. Price. Very good. Well, as opposed to ducking, that is 
a good answer. And, of course, when they are not playing each 
other, it is a very easy answer.
    Well, I do want to turn to you because we perhaps have a 
point of comparison here in terms of DOT's financial 
management, things that might have occurred to you in terms 
especially of the factors that go into better performance.
    I also want to turn to the question of these new challenges 
and the budget implications of them. Autonomous vehicles, 
unmanned aircraft going to need to communicate with other users 
in the national airspace and on our roads and highways. And as 
you have said repeatedly here this morning, this is a daunting 
task. It requires new skills, new tools for the Department to 
safely integrate these technologies into the transportation 
network. It will likely require additional resources and skill 
sets at DOT and, for that matter, in your own office to carry 
out and oversee these efforts.
    So, that is my question. If you have reflections on 
financial management generally, but then, in particular, when 
we are talking about hiring freezes, the budget cuts of the 
magnitude we are looking at here, how on Earth are we going to 
get on top of this new challenge?
    Mr. Scovel. Thanks, Mr. Price. Yes, just listening to 
General Montoya relate his woes at the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, I count myself lucky to be at the 
Department of Transportation in terms of its financial 
management. And I say that even remembering that within 2 weeks 
after my taking office as Inspector General in 2006, my office 
issued a qualified opinion to the Department, the only time, 
certainly within my tenure as Inspector General, that we saw 
the necessity to do that. And the reason at the time had to do 
with how FAA was accounting for its capital, if you will, its 
plants and equipment, and how it was accounting for 
depreciation and all of that.
    FAA is a big enough part of the Department that it rose to 
be a material deficiency. And our contract accountants at the 
time, KPMG, told us that they would be required to issue a 
qualified opinion and, of course, we did.
    I will give the Department and FAA great credit for 
immediately, upon that problem, setting about correcting it, 
and within the following year, had it nailed. And while it has 
been a watch item for us and our contract auditors in the years 
since, it has not risen to the point again where it threatened 
the integrity of the financial operation.
    We have had other problems that have arisen. I would have 
to cite Federal Highways. They had a significant problem with 
regard to unobligated balances for specific projects. The 
Department created a working group and immediately set upon 
that when we informed them early on that this was a potential 
problem.
    We have also had more recent questions with regard to how 
FTA has been cooperating with our contract auditors, and the 
Department has taken the stick to FTA on that. So, I am very 
much encouraged by it.
    With regard to an overall budget picture for the 
Department, I will leave it to the Secretary and her team to 
figure out how to do that with some of the emerging 
technologies that you cited, UAS, autonomous vehicles--a key 
for the agencies now trying to work through that problem. What 
will become even more significant going ahead will be 
engagement with stakeholders, keeping in mind, of course, the 
danger, if you will, or the specter of takeover of the 
regulator. But I think between us and the Secretary and the 
Congress, of course, we will be able to guard sufficiently 
against that.
    In my own office, I do have concerns about our budget. The 
hiring freeze is one thing for the next number of months, but a 
much longer concern and more immediate problem will be the 
hiring or the budget picture for our office.
    I respect General Montoya's 60-to-1 return on investment. 
In the last year, we had a 54-to-1 return on investment, 
meaning for every single appropriated dollar that our office 
received, we were able to return to the Government and the 
taxpayer $54.
    Together, I think we stand very near the top, certainly 
within the top five or six among all OIGs in Government.
    Seventy-five percent of my budget, sir, is allocated to 
personnel salary and expenses, because that is how we 
accomplish our mission. We have no programs. We have no 
hardware. We have no grants. We have no loans. We deliver 
reports of investigation to prosecutors so that they can try to 
nail the bad guys. We deliver audit reports to you and to the 
Secretary, so that together we can figure out how to improve 
efficiency, economy, and effectiveness for the Department's 
programs.
    I need people to do that, and most of my budget dollars go 
to pay them. If I cannot do that, then my ability to keep you 
and the Secretary fully and currently informed, and that is my 
mission by way of the IG Act, my ability to accomplish that 
mission will be threatened.
    I used the phrase earlier, sir, that elements in the 
Department do all they can with what we have. We are at the top 
of that list in terms of our OIG. I do not tell our people that 
we are going to do more with less, because that is a sure-fire 
method to drive people into the ground, but what I do tell them 
every day, I expect them to come to work and do all we can with 
what we have got.
    It will be up to the Congress and the administration to 
determine what our sum might be, but I want to assure this 
committee that you will have our 100-percent effort every day. 
Thanks.
    Mr. Price. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you. Mr. Young?
    Mr. Young. Mr. Montoya, the Mutual Mortgage Interest--
Insurance Fund, I'm sorry, Insurance Fund, there is an issue 
out there regarding the implication of this fund. The Property 
Accessed Clean Energy, or PACE loans as they call them, they 
are attached to the property rather than the borrower, have 
high interest rates, and are repaid by an assessment.
    So, there are concerns that allowing HUD to insure 
mortgages on properties with PACE loans because this puts them 
in a second lien position, and thereby increases the risk for 
the MMI Fund and taxpayers.
    As you know, the Federal Housing Finance Agency prohibits 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from insuring properties with PACE 
loans. So, there are concerns that the PACE loan problems echo 
the subprime mortgage issue that we had years ago. 
Creditworthiness does not matter, some say. No down payment is 
required. Contractors function as loan brokers. Often 
homeowners may not know what they are getting into. I am sure 
that all of us do not want to go back to the 2008 crisis, and 
avoid another $1.7 billion bailout.
    So, would you agree that allowing FHA funds to take a 
second lien position creates a greater risk to the MMI Fund and 
to taxpayers? And just talk about the implications of this 
policy and what you found. I would like your insights.
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question, Mr. 
Young. It goes to the point I made earlier that sometimes FHA 
is its own worst enemy, and we would agree. Putting the FHA 
mortgage in a second lien position to these PACE loans could 
very well be detrimental to the MMI Fund if homeowners default. 
And you are absolutely correct. Often, these homeowners do not 
understand the obligations of these loans, that these are 
assessments, they are not part of a loan, the traditional loan. 
And, in fact, we are not even sure that these PACE loans or 
these homeowners are actually going to benefit from any energy 
measures, and so that increases, obviously, the liability.
    It is a concern for me that back in 2015, we thought FHA 
was on pace to maybe not sort of back this idea. Something 
changed within the year, and they decided to go ahead and put 
out guidance that said they would insure these types of loans, 
with certain caveats that people needed to know that the loan 
should not be put in a second position, but they do not really 
have that say so because that is a State issue as to lien 
position on loans.
    So, we are troubled by it. We are appreciative that you 
brought this to our attention, to my attention. I actually did 
not realize this, but my audit staff has a proposed audit on 
these PACE loans, so I would commit to you that when we get 
done with that body of work and even maybe before that, we 
would love to give you an oral briefing, and certainly give you 
the report when it is done.
    Mr. Young. When do you anticipate that that audit may be 
done? We do not want to rush it, but just maybe a timeline.
    Mr. Montoya. Well, sure. So it was an audit proposal in 
this year's audit planning stage. So I obviously jumped into 
the fray and said that is going to be one of them, so it will 
be starting, hopefully, some time in the next several months.
    And so certainly, what we want to determine is the adequate 
controls that might mitigate the risks associated with insuring 
these loans, sir.
    Mr. Young. Thank you for that, appreciate that.
    Mr. Montoya. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Young. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Young. Mr. Aguilar?
    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you. Mr. Montoya, picking up a little 
bit on that, and maybe go back and forth between the MMI Fund 
and also, as you mentioned, some of the down payment assistance 
programs that present problems to your office.
    Just thinking about it from the perspective of underserved 
communities, in 2015, the top four home lenders scaled back on 
FHA lending in 2015, prioritizing conventional loans, while 39 
percent of all mortgages issued were government insured, 63 
percent of Latinos took out government-insured mortgage loans. 
So this is something that affects the community that I 
represent. Down payment assistance is crucial for families who 
would like to buy a home.
    In your office report on the FHA-insured loans published 
recommendations that HUD consider a position allowing some 
borrower-financed down payment assistance programs to also 
participate in the FHA program.
    So I guess my question is how do we ensure that proposed 
reforms do not create barriers to homeownership that 
disproportionately affect the Latino community?
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question, and it 
is a valid question. What we are sort of mandated to do and 
what we want to ensure we do is that the home borrower, the 
loan borrower, the homeowner, goes into these loans fully aware 
of what they are getting into, and that has been the problem 
all along is they are not fully informed of what these loans 
really mean, what this down--now, just to be clear, we do not 
have a problem or disagree with down payment assistance 
programs, generally speaking.
    We have a contention and a concern over a particular 
program where these premiums are raised often without the 
borrower knowing, so that when they get into the loan, they are 
going to have a higher premium interest rate on the loan. So 
that is the troubling part of this.
    Certainly, with regards to homeowners going into these 
loans fully informed, fully aware, fully understanding that 
they can or cannot pay for it, that should not close any 
community from accessing the loans. Our main purpose here is to 
ensure these borrowers are fully informed and aware of what it 
really means and what those numbers are going to really look 
like when they get into these loans.
    Mr. Aguilar. Can that be done through added disclosures? Or 
how can we further the goal of informing consumers so they know 
what they are getting into?
    Mr. Montoya. Absolutely, sir, added disclosure, and that 
was one of our recommendations. We had several recommendations 
on the down payment assistance audits that we did. And part of 
that is they have to fully disclose that, and you have to 
disclose that very overtly. You have to get a certification 
that you did disclose it.
    The Department does not even track these types of loans, 
which is even more troubling. They do not track them 
separately. So there is no real history on whether these things 
track well or not, you know, the higher premium interest rate 
of these loans as compared to general down payment assistance.
    These down payment assistance loans were initially designed 
to receive a grant or money to get people into the homes, 
right? With no expectation that the money would be paid back. 
Well, these higher interest loans are designed so that the 
money is paid back, and it is paid back on the back of the 
borrower. That is what the borrower does not understand. This 
is not, you know, a grant that is going to get you into a home 
and help you. They are going to pay for it themselves.
    So absolutely it goes to disclosing and to ensuring that 
occurs. And so that has been the biggest point of contention on 
this particular down payment assistance program.
    Mr. Aguilar. Right, okay. But your office is not expressing 
disagreement that offering the increasing affordability and 
access to these programs is a worthy goal. The question is how 
do we get there? What disclosures do we offer in order to 
protect consumers, and how do we ensure the program is legal 
moving forward as well?
    Mr. Montoya. Absolutely. It is a worthy goal and, as I said 
earlier, the mission of the Department is an honorable mission. 
What we want to ensure is that these individuals who are 
receiving these loans are fully aware and they are not taken 
advantage of.
    In the case of the PACE loan that we were just talking 
about, these contractors are pushing these loans, right? So it 
becomes this idea that you are not really protecting the 
consumer, and it really becomes sort of predatory lending, 
right?
    And so that is what our focus is, is to ensure that that 
sort of thing does not happen to these individuals, these 
families.
    Mr. Aguilar. I appreciate it. And, Mr. Scovel, I just 
wanted to let you know that I am sure I cannot speak for Mr. 
Montoya, but I am sure if you really felt some sympathy for his 
position, there are plenty of vacant positions at HUD, CFO as 
we have heard and others. So feel free to jump in with two 
hands and help out.
    Mr. Scovel. Ah, great.
    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, sir. Okay, I'm going to--any more 
questions? Well, I have got on here of local interest. Mr. 
Montoya, if you would not mind, the point-in-time count, are 
you familiar with that?
    Mr. Montoya. Generally familiar with it, yes, sir.
    Mr. Joyce. Okay. As you know, it requires communities 
receiving funds through the homeless assistance grants to 
conduct annual PIT counts, of people experiencing homelessness.
    The counts are to occur 1 day during the last week of 
January. The data collected on this day is then often used a 
model for total homelessness in a given area, and this has been 
problematic for communities that I represent, specifically 
Ashtabula County, Ohio. Located in the most northeast corner of 
the State, the county represents both rural and urban areas, 
and its proximity to Lake Erie leads to some of the most 
extreme weather patterns in the country, especially this week.
    Local homelessness assistance program directors have 
expressed concern that the PIT data collection method for which 
they must abide is problematic in obtaining an accurate count 
of homelessness in this region. For one, homeless individuals 
in rural areas take shelter in hard-to-locate and spread-out 
locations, making it difficult to pinpoint and register 
individuals in the timeframe given.
    Additionally, it is a safe bet at this time of year you are 
going to see some extreme weather, during which many homeless 
individuals take shelter in local businesses, such as 
laundromats, fast food restaurants, making it even harder to 
account for a large population of the vulnerable.
    Has your office evaluated any ways by which the assistance 
programs can collect more accurate data? And if so, what are 
your recommendations for doing so?
    Mr. Montoya. Thank you for your question, Mr. Joyce. We 
have not done any body of work on this particular program. I 
would be interested, and I have asked my staff to look into it, 
as to whether the systems that HUD uses to collect this data is 
something we could do analysis on to figure out where these 
accounts are occurring.
    Recognizing they do do this one night every year, and every 
other year I think they go to those populations who are not in 
shelters in very specific areas. I think it would be difficult 
in all cases to sort of make sure you are not missing anybody. 
But we have not done any body of work. I certainly would be 
interested into looking into that a little bit deeper for you 
to see what we might be able to ask with regards to how 
complete this program really counts.
    Mr. Joyce. Well, thank you very much. Mr. Price?
    Mr. Price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, in this final round, 
would like to turn to an issue that is extremely important and 
needs to be addressed. And I hope that in the time remaining 
you can at least give a cursory update on your progress. Both 
departments, of course, have critical and sensitive 
information, technology systems, air traffic control, 
processing of federally insured mortgages, and on and on. And 
cyber attacks are a very real and a serious threat in all these 
areas.
    Every day outdated legacy information systems perform these 
critical tasks and yet pose unique information security 
challenges. And they are often fragile. They often lack the 
resiliency of their modern counterparts. So, just to take HUD 
alone, you note, Mr. Montoya, that the fiscal 2016 IT funding 
decreased 16.3 percent from the previous year, and then 
decreased another 16 percent in 2017. So, constrained resources 
is a euphemism, I think, for how these agencies are operating 
in this area. And then looking ahead, maybe even more 
constraints.
    So, could you give us an update on what work remains to be 
done in improving the security and resiliency of legacy IT 
systems in each of your departments? Give us an idea of whether 
or not this can be achieved within existing resources.
    Mr. Montoya. Yes, Mr. Price. So, with ours, just to give 
you a sense, I think there is over 400 HUD IT products that are 
running on unsupported platforms. So, again, that goes to the 
critical need for that.
    To the extent that any budget cut will certainly have an 
impact on how quickly they can get to these security concerns 
and issues, but really for them, it is not even a matter of 
patching and security awareness, it is about creating new IT 
systems that can take over where these aging systems will 
eventually just--will stop. So, that is naturally the more 
critical aspect.
    So, even with any budget cut, I think it is going to have 
to be a real focus on the priorities, what has to come first 
and what should come first. And I think that would be my 
simplest answer, that even when it comes to our Department, at 
some point security patches really are not going to work on 
these things. So, it is beyond patching these things. It is 
really about moving them on to new systems.
    Mr. Scovel. Thank you, sir. For DOT, I would say somewhat 
much the same thing. There needs to be, certainly, 
prioritization of replacement for those key of the 460 or so IT 
systems that the Department of Transportation relies on. With 
regards specifically to your point about cyber attacks and 
vulnerabilities, of course we do the required FISMA audit every 
single year.
    We have highlighted across all the domains of cybersecurity 
areas where the Department needs to make progress. With regard 
to continuous monitoring, for instance, last year we found that 
with regard to one of the Department's major networks, the 
monitoring tool had detected 110,000 weaknesses at the time, 
yet the Operating Administrations that rely on that network had 
not been informed where those weaknesses were, so that they 
could undertake remediation at that level.
    With regard to incident handling and reporting, we found 
similar shortcomings. The committee may remember that in 2014 
there was a fire caused by a contract employee in the En Route 
Air Traffic Control Center near Chicago. The center had to be 
shut down for several weeks. The aviation industry reported 
losses of upward of $350 million as a result. Yet that 
significant incident had not been reported. Everyone knew about 
it because it was in the news, but it had not been reported 
officially to the Department, because the Department views FAA 
as separate and apart in its incident-reporting requirements. 
Neither FAA nor the Department had reported it to the 
Department of Homeland Security, to the U.S. Computer Emergency 
Readiness Team. Glaring, glaring deficiency.
    With regard to contingency planning, this is mentioned 
specifically in our longer statement. Of the Department's 460 
systems or so, we determined last year that 86 percent had not 
experienced recent or comprehensive contingency testing of its 
recovery plans should the inevitable cyber attack occur.
    So, those would be three areas where the Department clearly 
needs to prioritize its efforts. Longer range, ultimate fixes, 
like at HUD, may rely on upgrading, as financial resources 
permit, updating the networks themselves. But clearly in the 
meantime, there is much work to be done.
    Mr. Price. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Price, Mr. Young. Well, I just 
want to thank both of you gentlemen, along with your staff, for 
all the answers and your participation here today. The 
committee staff will be in contact with the budget officers 
regarding questions for the record. I know I have a number of 
questions to submit, and I would imagine other members of the 
subcommittee do as well. And if you would work with the OMB to 
return the information for the record to the committee within 
30 days from Friday, we will be able to publish a transcript of 
today's hearing.
    Mr. Price, any final comments?
    Mr. Price. No, it was a very useful hearing. Thank you both 
for being here.
    Mr. Joyce. Yes, thank you both. As a former prosecutor, I 
appreciate exactly what you are doing. And keep up the great 
work.
    Mr. Montoya. Thank you, Chairman.
    Mr. Joyce. With that, this hearing is adjourned.
    Mr. Montoya. Thank you, sir.
                                            Thursday, May 18, 2017.
