    <Doc-title>EXAMINING IRS CUSTOMER SERVICE CHALLENGES</Doc-title>
    <paragraph paraId="0" speaker="">Room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Mark Meadows 
[chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations] 
presiding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="">Present from the Subcommittee on Government Operations: 
Representatives Meadows, Hice, Jordan, DeSantis, Blum, and 
Connolly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="">    Present from the Subcommittee on Health Care, Benefits, and 
Administrative Rules: Representatives Jordan, Meadows, 
Grothman, Mitchell, Krishnamoorthi, and Plaskett.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Meadows">The Subcommittee on Government Operations and
the Subcommittee on Health Care, Benefits, and Administrative 
Rules will come to order. And without objection, the chair is 
authorized to declare a recess at any time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Meadows">The IRS is the Federal agency that the average American 
probably interacts with more frequently than most other 
agencies in the Federal Government. And as we look at customer 
service at the IRS and how most Americans experience the 
Federal Government, we owe it to them to make sure that their 
experience is clear and helpful. And if the taxpayers can get 
help from the IRS to understand some of the often more 
complicated tax obligations, the IRS then does not have to 
spend as much time looking or providing resources for audits or 
enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Meadows">Unfortunately, the 2015 tax season had one of the worst 
customer service records in IRS history with only 38 percent of 
the taxpayers who called the IRS assistance line actually 
getting a representative. And thereafter, the average wait time 
was well over 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Meadows">And so as we look at this, as the IRS calls for more 
resources, Congress indeed did grant them $298 million in for 
the 2016 tax season with $176 million specifically marked for 
taxpayer services. As a result, the 2016 filing season was 
better but still not as good as it was a decade earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Meadows">    So as we look at today's hearing, I am going to keep my 
opening remarks very brief because we are expecting votes here 
in just a few minutes. And we will certainly yield to a number 
of the other members as they have questions. And I will include 
some of that in my questioning. And the entire written 
statement will be made part--or opening statement will be made 
part of the record.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> So with that, I will now recognize the ranking
member for his opening statement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Thank you, Chairmen Meadows and Jordan,
for holding this important hearing on a topic that is so 
familiar to so many Americans: IRS customer service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Many of the individuals I represent encounter challenges 
when dealing with the IRS. The individuals are hardworking, 
honest Americans who are doing everything they can in order to 
comply with their tax obligations. I have seen some of these 
individuals go to great lengths to fulfill their 
responsibilities: contacting the IRS and others for help, 
providing what seems like an endless stream of documentation to 
their agency and their employers in order to get on an 
installment plan, and in some cases even digging into their 
hard-earned retirement savings to pay their outstanding tax 
debts. So while IRS says that it is working hard to improve 
customer service, it can be difficult for many of my 
constituents to believe in some cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">As our nation's tax code becomes increasingly complex, the 
burden placed on those trying to maintain tax compliances also 
increases. It is absolutely critical that the IRS have the 
appropriate channels to assist these well-meaning taxpayers and 
processes in place to rectify situations in which these 
channels fail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">For that reason, and as a former small businessman, I hope 
we can shed some light on the processes currently in existence 
at the IRS for assisting customers before, during, and after 
the filing season. All customers deserve to have their 
questions answered in a timely, effective, and respectful 
manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">What does it take to make that happen? As the Oversight 
Committee, we have a responsibility to ensure that government 
works effectively and efficiently and is responsive to the 
citizens it serves. We should encourage agencies to take a hard 
look at themselves and identify areas that are working, as well 
as those that need improvement. We should encourage agencies to 
adopt best practices from other areas of government and the 
private sector, and we should certainly encourage agencies to 
listen to feedback from those on the other side of the table. 
Only after doing that can we have a meaningful discussion of 
what needs to be done and what resources need to be devoted in 
order to make our system succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    I hope that these are discussions we can have today, and I 
look forward to the testimony of our witnesses. Thank you. I 
yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Meadows">I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Meadows">    The chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan, 
for his opening statement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Jordan">I want to just thank the chairman for helping
us put this important hearing together. As we are heading into 
tax season or into tax season, I think this is going to be some 
hopefully valuable information for the folks we get the 
privilege of serving and representing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Jordan">    So with that, I would yield back and look forward to the 
witness' testimony.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Meadows">I thank the gentleman. We will hold the record
open for five legislative days for any member who would like to 
submit a written statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Meadows">I will now recognize our panel of witnesses. I am pleased 
to welcome the Honorable John Dalrymple, deputy commissioner 
for Services and Enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service. 
Welcome. Mr. Russell Martin, deputy inspector general with the 
Treasury, inspector general for the Tax Administration, 
welcome. And Ms. Jessica Lucas-Judy, acting director of 
Strategic Issues at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, 
welcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Meadows">And pursuant to committee rules, all witnesses will be 
sworn in before they testify, so if you would please rise and 
raise your right hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Meadows">    [Witnesses sworn.]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Meadows">Thank you. Please be seated. And let the
record reflect that all witnesses answered in the affirmative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Meadows">In order to allow time for discussion, we would ask that 
you please limit your oral testimony to five minutes, but your 
entire written testimony and statement will be made part of the 
record.</paragraph>

    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF JOHN DALRYMPLE</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="JOHN DALRYMPLE">    And so, Mr. Dalrymple, we will recognize you for five 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Thank you. Chairmen Meadows and Jordan,
Ranking Member ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Maybe just pull the--yes, a little bit closer
to you there. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">I thought I was loud enough. Sorry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">Chairmen Meadows, Jordan, and Ranking Member 
Krishnamoorthi, and members of the subcommittees, thank you for 
the opportunity to testify on IRS's taxpayer service efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">The IRS spends a significant amount of time and resources 
on this part of our mission because every taxpayer contact is 
important to us. The most visible taxpayer service the IRS 
provides is the delivery of a smooth, problem-free tax filing 
season so people can file their returns and receive their 
refunds as quickly and easily as possible. I am pleased to 
report that, so far, the 2017 filing season has gone smoothly 
in terms of tax processing and the operation of our information 
technology systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">As of February 24, the IRS received more than 53.2 million 
individual returns on the way to a total of about 152 million. 
We've issued more than 41.3 million refunds for more than $127 
billion. The average refund so far is more than $3,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">During the filing season and throughout the year, the IRS 
provides assistance to taxpayers to help them meet their tax 
obligations. With over 150 million individual taxpayers, we 
realized there is no one-size-fits-all in terms of delivering 
service to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">We offer a mix of service channels and are always looking 
for ways to improve service delivery. Over many years, we've 
been working to expand our online service offerings because our 
research tells us that taxpayers increasingly prefer to 
interact with us through digital channels. Last year, taxpayers 
visited our website, IRS.gov, more than 500 million times. They 
used IRS.gov to find helpful tax information, check on the 
status of their refund, and perform transactions such as paying 
their tax bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">We've also been working to develop an online account at the 
IRS where taxpayers or their representatives can log in 
securely, get information about their account, and interact 
with the IRS as needed. We recognize that there will always be 
taxpayers who prefer not to interact with the IRS online. For 
that reason, we will continue providing and improving service 
on our other channels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">One of these is phone service. The IRS receives more than 
63 million taxpayer calls a year on our toll-free lines. A very 
challenging year in fiscal year 2015 the level of service 
provided on the phones improved significantly in 2016 as a 
result of additional funding from Congress. I'm pleased to 
report that during the 2017 filing season we are again seeing 
an even improved phone service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">The IRS also provides in-person help to millions of 
taxpayers who visit our Tax Assistance Centers, or TACs, as we 
call them. Each of these contacts is also important to the IRS, 
and to cut down on long lines at our TACs, the IRS in 2015 
began testing the idea of letting people make appointments in 
advance. We extended the appointment process to call--I'm 
sorry, to all TACs as of this year. Doing so has dramatically 
cut wait times, and we've had no reports of any lines outside 
TACs so far this filing season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">Another way the IRS provides in-person help is by 
supporting nearly 12,000 volunteer income tax assistance and 
tax counseling for the elderly sites around the country. 
Volunteers at these sites provide free tax preparation help to 
eligible individuals. Along with the service we provide on 
these channels, the IRS also processes nearly 8 million pieces 
of correspondence from taxpayers each year, and these taxpayers 
are also important to us.</paragraph>

    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Meadows">Thank you so much for your testimony. As
Murphy's law would have it, they called votes just about the 
time that you started speaking. And so what we are going to do 
is go into recess. And for planning purposes, it will actually 
be subject to the call of the chair, but for those of you that 
may want to get a cup of coffee, if you will plan on being back 
here no later than 10 till 3:00. It may be later than that but 
certainly--the subcommittees stand in recess subject to the 
call of the chair.</paragraph>

    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Meadows">The subcommittees will come to order. Thank
you all for your patience and willingness to stay with us 
throughout this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Meadows">    Mr. Dalrymple, I want to congratulate you on your upcoming 
retirement. A little birdie told me that you were retiring in a 
couple of weeks, so we will try to make this as painless as 
possible. How about that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> You can't imagine how I appreciate that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Meadows">And before I recognize you, Mr. Martin, I want
to recognize Mr. Sapp who is here from Drake Software, a good

actually deals with these kinds of issues. And so it is good to 
have you here as well.</paragraph>

    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF RUSSELL MARTIN</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="RUSSELL MARTIN">    So, Mr. Martin, you are recognized for five minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Martin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Martin">Thank you. Chairmen, Ranking Members, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to 
testify on IRS's efforts to provide customer service to 
taxpayers, including those who are victims of identity theft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Martin">For the 2017 filing season, taxpayers have multiple options 
to choose from when they need assistance from the IRS. Examples 
include the toll-free telephone lines, face-to-face assistance, 
the mail, self-assistance through IRS.gov, and social media 
channels such as Twitter and Facebook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Martin">Despite other available options, taxpayers continue to use 
the telephone as the primary method to seek assistance from the 
IRS. The IRS is projecting a 75 percent level of service for 
the 2017 filing season, an increase from 72 percent reported 
for the 2016 filing season. The level of service represents the 
relative success rate of taxpayers who call the IRS for 
assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Martin">As of February 11, 2017, the IRS reports it answered 
approximately 2.5 million calls and provided an 82 percent 
level of service. Each year, millions of taxpayers also seek 
assistance from one of the IRS's 376 walk-in offices known as 
Taxpayer Assistance Centers or TACs. Although the IRS reports 
there are 376 TACs for the 2017 filing season, 24 are not open 
because they have not been staffed. The IRS estimates that the 
number of taxpayers it will assist at its TACs will continue to 
decrease. The IRS plans to assist more than 3.4 million 
taxpayers at its TACs in fiscal year 2017, a 22 percent 
decrease from fiscal year 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Martin">Taxpayers also interact with the IRS through the mail. The 
IRS's ability to timely process taxpayer correspondence remains 
a challenge. IRS management stated that the reduction in 
available staff is the most significant factor in not timely 
responding to taxpayer correspondence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Martin">In response to increased demand for online self-assistant 
options, the IRS continues to increase the services they 
provide online. However, as we have reported, the risk of 
unauthorized access to tax accounts increases as the IRS 
expands its focus on delivering online tools. Therefore, it is 
critical that the methods the IRS uses to authenticate 
individuals' identities provide a high level of confidence that 
tax information and services are provided only to individuals 
who are entitled to receive them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Martin">Much of the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers require 
staffing. Beginning in fiscal year 2015, the IRS made some 
resource decisions, which significantly affected the level of 
service provided to taxpayers. This included shifting a 
significant portion of the user fees it collects to operation 
support to implement other obligations required by law. In 
fiscal year 2016, the IRS received $178 million in additional 
funding by Congress. As a result, it has increased its level of 
service substantially from its low of 38 percent in fiscal year 
2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Martin">The IRS also continues to devote significant resources to 
assist victims of identity theft. In July 2015 the IRS created 
a centralized unit to combine the skills of employees working 
identity theft cases in multiple functions into one 
directorate. This has resulted in improvements in case closure 
time frames and a reduction in case closing errors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Martin">To help protect identity theft victims and improve 
authentication, the IRS began issuing unique identification 
numbers to eligible taxpayers in fiscal year 2011. The issuance 
of these numbers to confirmed victims of identity theft reduces 
IRS's resources needed to resolve identity theft cases. 
Specifically, this number helps the IRS verify a victim's 
identity at the time their tax return is filed and, as a 
result, not delay the processing of the taxpayer's return or 
issuance of their refund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Martin">However, TIGTA has identified that confirmed victims of 
identity theft tax accounts were not always consistently 
updated to ensure that these identification numbers were 
generated as required. This results in the need to 
unnecessarily use additional resources to review future tax 
return filings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Martin">TIGTA has reported that the trend of lower budgets and 
reduced staffing has affected the IRS's ability to deliver its 
priority program areas, including customer service and 
enforcement activities. The allocation of limited resources 
requires difficult decisions to balance customer service with 
enforcement activities.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">Ms. Lucas-Judy?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">Ms. Lucas-Judy. Chairmen Meadows and Jordan, Ranking 
Members Connolly and Krishnamoorthi, members of the 
subcommittees, thank you for this opportunity to discuss GAO's 
recommendation for improving IRS customer service. My statement 
today focuses on two areas: IRS's performance in 2016 compared 
to prior years and its efforts to improve service for victims 
of identity theft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">During the filing season, millions of taxpayers contact 
IRS. The service also processes most of the approximately 150 
million tax returns it receives during this time and issues 
more than 100 million refunds. The scale of these operations, 
as well as IRS's declining resources, have raised concerns 
about its ability to provide service to taxpayers. Maintaining 
quality customer service is important because it helps 
taxpayers comply with the tax code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">Regarding the first area, performance, IRS provided better 
telephone service to callers during the 2016 filing season 
compared to 2015. More people who wanted to speak to an 
assister were able to get through. In fact, it was the highest 
level of service for a filing season since 2011. However, IRS 
performance during the full fiscal year remained low.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">In addition, wait times were much shorter than in 2015, 11 
minutes rather than 23 minutes on average. Total calls where 
taxpayers abandoned the call, were disconnected, or received a 
busy signal declined about 10 percent. These improvements were 
because IRS devoted additional resources and staff to answering 
calls, as well as offered overtime to staff after receiving 
additional funding and allocating user fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">However, IRS does not make customer service information, 
including average wait time, easily available such as through 
an online dashboard. Without this information, taxpayers are 
not well informed on what to expect when they're requesting 
services from IRS. Accordingly, we recommended that IRS display 
customer service standards and performance online, and the 
agency agreed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">The second area is customer service for victims of identity 
theft refund fraud. IRS estimates it paid at least $2 billion 
identity theft refunds in 2015. Such fraud also burdens honest 
taxpayers because authenticating their identities can delay 
processing their returns and their refunds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">We found IRS has overall improved aspects of service for 
victims of this fraud. For example, IRS reduced its backlog of 
cases and began consolidating inventory and better managing its 
case flow. However, we did find three things that IRS could 
further improve. First, IRS's file retrieval and scanning 
processes contributed to delays and unnecessary document 
requests. We reviewed a sample of 16 identity theft cases, and 
in two of those cases it had taken six weeks or more for IRS to 
retrieve and scan the requested documents, during which time 
the assisters closed the cases without receiving the documents. 
This leads to the question whether or not they were even 
needed. We recommended IRS review its retrieval and scanning 
procedures for improvements, which IRS agreed to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">Second, we found potential weaknesses in IRS's internal 
control processes could lead to IRS paying refunds to 
fraudsters. In discussion groups, IRS assisters and managers 
told us some assisters may release refunds even if indicators 
on the account show the tax return was under review for 
identity theft. We recommended IRS improve its data or collect 
new data to monitor how and why assisters might be releasing 
refunds before closing these types of cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">IRS disagreed, stating that the problem was not widespread 
and current processes are sufficient. However, we maintain the 
data IRS was using had weaknesses and were not sufficient to 
make that determination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">In response to our draft report, IRS sent us an analysis 
that they said showed this type of error does occur but may not 
be as widespread as the discussion group participants 
suggested. We'll continue to work with IRS on this important 
issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">Finally, we found IRS does not notify taxpayers when a 
dependent's identity appears on a fraudulent return. By not 
doing so, IRS is limiting taxpayers' ability to take action to 
protect its dependents' identity. We recommended IRS revise 
notices to victims to include information such as whether 
dependents were claimed on the fraudulent return, and IRS 
agreed with this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="JESSICA LUCAS-JUDY">In summary, as taxpayers file their returns for 2016, it's 
important that IRS ensures timely, quality service. IRS can 
increase transparency and accountability by implementing our 
recommendations to provide performance information, improve 
file retrieval and scanning, determine how assisters might 
release refunds, and notify taxpayers when dependents' 
identities have been used fraudulently.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Meadows">Thank you all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Meadows">    The chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan, 
for five minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Jordan">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Jordan">    Mr. Dalrymple, why has taxpayer service at the IRS been 
terrible?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Taxpayer service at the IRS has been
improving, in fact, I think this year is a perfect example of 
where taxpayer service could be going forward given the 
resources necessary ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Taxpayer advocates said that taxpayer service
is the number one most serious problem at the Internal Revenue 
Service. The current Commissioner, someone who, frankly, I am 
not a big fan of, said it was ``abysmal.'' Mr. Meadows, the 
chairman, indicated in his opening comments that 38 percent of 
the callers asking for assistance, only 38 percent actually got 
to a representative.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> That was in 2015. In ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> That is why I said why has taxpayer service at
the IRS been terrible?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, it's--it was clearly a resource issue,
Congress.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Resource issue?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Could it be your priorities were misplaced?
Could that be a problem?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">I don't think so. I think the real issue
here is how the budget actually works. You know, the IRS 
receives its budget in three specific categories: taxpayer 
service, enforcement, and operation support. And in order to 
move money from--between those appropriations, it has to ask 
for permission from Congress to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">    And in 2015 actually we moved $30 million from enforcement 
into our taxpayer service operation. So I don't think that's --
--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> And you asked Congress for that ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> And we asked Congress to do that, and they
allowed us to do that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Why didn't you ask for more? Why didn't you ask
for it more often ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> We had ----
</paragraph>

    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> It was abysmal. There's not enough money to
go around for anything. The audit rates at the IRS have also 
dropped ----

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Let me just give you one example of what I
would argue is mismanagement of taxpayer resources at the 
Internal Revenue Service. You know a gentleman named Terry 
Milholland?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I--he was the former CIO.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> He was former what?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> The former CIO.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Chief information officer?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Okay. And was he chief information officer when
the IRS targeted conservative groups? Was he functioning in 
that role at that time?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I'm not certain when he became CIO.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Yes, between 2008 and 2016 he definitely was.
Was he chief information officer when Lois Lerner's hard drive 
crashed?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I think he probably was.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> He was. And was he chief information order--
officer, excuse me, when 422 backup tapes were destroyed at the 
IRS, tapes under subpoena?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I think he would have been the CIO at that
point.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Yes. And was he the gentleman who issued the
preservation order to not destroy those 422 backup tapes?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> He could have been.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> He definitely was. I have seen it. And did Mr.
Milholland live in Washington, D.C.?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I'm not sure where Mr. Milholland lived.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Yes. He lived in Texas. In fact, in 2015 alone,
$55,000 was spent by Mr. Milholland, taxpayer money, for him to 
commute to Texas, come up here to Washington, and 30 weeks of 
commuting back and forth, the guy who is in charge of 
maintaining--keeping the records, the guy who gave the 
preservation order that wasn't followed, backup tapes 
destroyed, $55,000, $18,000 for lodging, $7,000 for meals and 
incidentals, $2,500 for airport parking, 14--$1,100, excuse me, 
for mileage and toll reimbursement, $1,500 he charged for taxi 
service. He probably took taxis instead of Uber.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I'm not sure when Uber even began,
Congressman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Well, it was certainly in 2016, 2015. So maybe
it is that the IRS doesn't have the priorities in the right 
place. Do you know what is streamlined critical pay authority, 
Mr. Dalrymple?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Streamlined critical pay authority allows
the IRS to be able to direct hire skilled individuals that we 
need to, particularly generally in our IT functions to be able 
to ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Allows you to pay them more than they would
otherwise get, right, more than the top salary allowed under 
the pay schedule for Federal work?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> For SES, that's correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Yes. Was Mr. ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> And--but also in addition to that, it allows
us to directly hire them quickly because these people ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Okay, quickly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">--have skills that don't ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> You hired this guy quickly, but he couldn't
move here in eight years. He still lived in Texas charging in 
one year alone $55,000, couldn't take Uber, took a taxi 
instead. Was Mr. Milholland getting critical pay?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I believe he was.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> I know he was, right? So he was getting paid
more than any other Federal worker, couldn't live here, $55,000 
in one year, hanging out at the Hyatt, taking taxis, reimburse 
him for everything you can imagine it looks like here. And 
while he is the chief technology officer, the guy who is 
critically important, we have got to pay more than we pay 
anyone else in the Federal Government under his watch, the 
chief technology officer, Lerner's hard drive crashes, 422 
backup tapes are destroyed even though he personally gave the 
preservation order to preserve all communication. And here is 
the kicker: He purchased some $12 million email archiving 
system that these guys at GAO said he never even implemented, 
$12 million just thrown down the drain. And you are telling me 
that it is improving and it wasn't pathetic and it wasn't 
terrible?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> You asked me about the taxpayer service
activities, not about the IT organization. And by the way, they 
don't work for me.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Was this taxpayer dollars that were used for
Mr. Milholland?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I assume that they would have been, of
course ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Of course, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">--appropriated dollars.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> And you just told me you can ask to have money
transferred and that we have already given the authority to do 
that in situations to actually better serve the taxpayers. All 
I am saying is it could be priorities are a little out of place 
at the IRS, and that is contributing to the pathetic taxpayer 
treatment, customer service, or lack of customer service that 
the hardworking taxpayers of this country have been receiving. 
I went over time, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the indulgence.

    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Well, in listening to my friend Mr. Jordan--and I will say 
this underscores for me why it makes sense to have the seat of

    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Okay. I guess I want to shift the subject a
little bit to the--well, the budget and the IT budget in 
particular, which you brought up, Mr. Dalrymple. Ms. Lucas-
Judy, how much has IRS budget been cut in the last six or seven 
years, about $1 billion or more?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. It's been about--a decline of about $900 
million.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Connolly">I am sorry?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. About $900 million since 2011 I believe.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Okay. And how many--in terms of numbers of
personnel, what has been the reduction or increase net?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. I don't have the precise figures. I'd be 
happy to get those to you. But I know it's--the number of full-

number.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Connolly"> Mr. Dalrymple, do you know? I can't hear you,
sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Seventeen thousand employees over that span.

    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Seventeen thousand. Well, that is a number
worth GAO's attention, Ms. Lucas-Judy. I mean, it is has not 
just gone down a bit. Seventeen thousand by any account is a 
lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. Yes, and that is something that GAO has

    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Connolly">But, I mean--but isn't that ----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy.--capital management ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Isn't that about 20 percent of the workforce?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Well, that is a lot of people. And your
budget has gone down almost by $1 billion. I mean, even if 
everyone whistled while they work, I would think those kinds of 
reductions might have some effect on productivity and on the 
ability to provide high-quality customer service. Fair 
statement, Ms. Lucas-Judy?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Connolly">From a management point of view. Now,
sometimes we do more with less. Sometimes we make ourselves 
more efficient. But when I look at IRS, given the, you know, 
unceasing war on the IRS and the constant drumbeat about Lois 
Lerner and the so-called attack on certain political 
orientation of various organizations, it has all seemingly been 
a justification for gutting the IRS, an agency we don't like 
because it is big and it is the vehicle that finances the 
enterprise, which we also apparently don't like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Would you say, Mr. Dalrymple, that these cuts have had an 
appreciable effect on the ability of the IRS to fully perform 
its mission?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Absolutely. Taxpayer service has been in
some instances abysmal. I mean, the Commissioner was right 
about that. We haven't been able to answer the telephones when 
we should. We haven't been able to answer correspondence as--at 
the speed we should. We haven't been able to develop online 
services at the rate we should for taxpayers. Our audit rates 
are down dramatically. Our collection--our collections are down 
over time. There ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Connolly"> Just speaking of collection so people
understand, how much money is left on the table do we estimate 
every year really owed to the government but not collected 
because of lack of resources?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, the tax gap is estimated at about $450
billion, and that's just ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Connolly"> A year?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> A year.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Wow. That is a lot of money. Okay. One thinks
about what one could do with that amount of money if you had 
it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    And on the IT side, last time we looked at this I want to 
say the average age of computers at the IRS was about seven 
years. I assume it is now older. Is that about right, Mr. 
Dalrymple?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I can't comment on that. I'm not a--I'm not
familiar enough ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Ms. Lucas-Judy, do you know?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. I do know that we have recommended that IRS 
needs to modernize a lot of it systems ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy.--that that will go a long way towards 
helping the organization.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Connolly">But, I mean, if you are replacing computers
every seven or eight years, that is not the industry standard. 
The industry standard is more like two to three years, is that 
right?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. Right. And they are relying a lot on legacy 
systems.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Correct. And so--that is right, on top of
that. So part of the problem, what could go wrong with that? 
Well, a lot of hard drive crashes like that which occurred in 
the IRS that was certainly the focus of hearings in this 
committee, is that not correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. I'm not--I have not looked at that specific 
instance.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Connolly">Well, I am not asking about that specific
instance. I am generally saying when computers are that old and 
----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. They do become unreliable.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Connolly"> Right. And we have problems. And the guidance
in some parts of the IRS anyhow--correct me if I am wrong--was 
in order to archive material, the instructions were print and 
save. Ever hear of that, Mr. Dalrymple?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I have, and that's ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Connolly"> That is astounding. And we have, what, 81,000
employees, something like that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Something in that neighborhood ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Connolly"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">--including all of the full-time folks plus
temporaries and seasonal ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Connolly"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">--et cetera.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Connolly"> And we have got data on every single tax
filer, which is several hundred million, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> That's correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Connolly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Connolly">So what could go wrong with that? So at the
very least, hopefully, we here in Congress, if we are concerned 
about customer service, if we are concerned about the very 
issues that have been cited, maybe we could make a smart 
investment in IT to make the IRS more efficient, doing more 
with less, and we can close that gap of the amount of money 
owed but not collected, my shorthand, I think obviously could 
make an appreciable difference in financing other investments, 
including the new President's defense initiative, which is $54 
billion, a small part of the $450 billion you referred to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Connolly">    So with that I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> [Presiding] Mr. Martin, just real quick, my
good friend from Virginia said the so-called targeting. When 
TIGTA did its report, did it use the term so-called or did it 
say targeting took place at the IRS?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Martin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Martin"> We said inappropriate criteria was used.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Jordan">Okay. I appreciate that. I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Jordan">    The gentleman from Georgia is recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Hice">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Hice">    Mr. Dalrymple, let me just go with you here. I am shocked--
actually, not shocked. Probably all of us have experienced 
these kind of statistics with the IRS, but in 2015, less than 
10 percent of the callers whose returns were flagged as 
suspicious for possible identity theft, less than 10 percent 
were able to get through an IRS helpline. What is that number 
now?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, our levels of service right now on our
helplines is right around 80 percent. We're scheduling about 75 
percent for this filing season and about 70 percent overall.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Hice"> More than 60 percent could not get through the
National Taxpayer Advocate phoneline that is the safety net. 
What is that figure now?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I have no idea what the--what it is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Hice"> In 2015 the IRS received more calls than ever. Is
that true?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes. And the reason for that--that's true is
because people call back over and over if they can't get 
through so ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Hice"> Okay. Well, it doesn't matter to me what the
reason is but they received more calls than ever and answered 
fewer calls ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> That's correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Hice">--than ever. Do you know what official time is?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I do know what official time is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Hice"> Do you have any idea how many people with the IRS
are on official time?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I couldn't tell you that number. I have no
idea.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Hice"> Could you get that number and provide it for me?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes, we can.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Hice"> All right. I would like a divided in those that
are 100 percent ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Sure.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Hice">--versus those that are part-time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Absolutely.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Hice"> Thank you for that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Hice"> In 2012, our reports show that the IRS approved
62 people to be 100 percent on official time as contact service 
representatives. These are people answering phones, that type 
of thing, approved 62. I am assuming that is 62 more than what 
perhaps were on official time before. Now, official time means 
that they are hired to do IRS work but they end up doing union 
work. In 2012 you had 62 of them that you approved who were 
customer service reps that went to 100 percent. In addition to 
that, there were another 70 that were approved for other IRS 
jobs. Any idea how many phone calls those 62 people could have 
answered?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I couldn't tell you that. I ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Hice"> Our calculations show that those 62 people could
have answered approximately 11,000 phone calls a week. That is 
over half-a-million phone calls a year, and yet you were not 
able to answer phone calls. People were waiting in line. And I 
am quite confident that there are more people on official time 
now at the IRS then there were five years ago. Is that a fair 
assessment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I have no idea how many people were on
official time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Hice"> Okay. But we are going to find out that, and like
I said, I'm confident. Was there any discussion during 2015 on 
those who were on official time 100 percent of their time--was 
there any discussion saying that a crisis was underway of 
getting people who are on official time to come off and go back 
to work?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> No. That's governed by our union contract.
So no, there was no discussion ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Hice"> So who allows these people to go on official time
to begin with?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, if they're in a position--a specific
position with the union that allows for them to be on 100 
percent official time, that's governed by our union contract.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Hice"> So you have no say-so--no one at the IRS has any
say-so whatsoever as to how many people are on official time?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> We have--they have to justify their official
time based on the amount of time that they're expected ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Hice"> And you are not able to justify your reason for
them not to be on official time because you have a crisis with 
people not being able to get in to the IRS?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I have to say I'm not familiar enough with
the union contract to be able to say that we couldn't move them 
to work status ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Hice"> So so far as you know there is no mechanism in
place for the IRS to retrieve people who are on official time 
to come back to work?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I'm not aware--it's possible that the union
contract allows for that but I'm not certain.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Hice"> Don't you think that might be something to be
certain of if there is such a catastrophe where people are not 
able to get answers?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I think that it's probably something I
should know but I don't.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Hice">I think it probably is, too. I have just got a
couple of seconds left. You know, we hear of these kind of 
issues over and over, and the IRS has come before this 
Congress, this committee over and over, and always the answer 
is we need more resources. I am absolutely convinced the IRS 
does not need--you don't have a resource problem; you have a 
waste problem. You have got people right there who were hired 
to do the job who are going off doing union work rather than 
the job for which they were paid to do. That seems awfully 
wasteful to me on the backs of taxpayers and on the backs of 
people who need answers to their tax returns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Hice">    Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Jordan">I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Jordan">    I now recognize the gentleman from Illinois for his five 
minutes of questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    Mr. Dalrymple, after your experience here, are you still 
planning to retire in two weeks?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">If not earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">    [Laughter.]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Just kidding.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Well, in any case, thank you all for
coming today. I know this is not a--I think it is always useful 
to have a feedback loop and obviously this hearing is part of 
that process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Look, as a former small business owner, I too have 
struggled to consistently obtain quality, timely customer 
service from the agency. I don't think this is just merely one 
or two data points. I think that there are a lot of people who 
have struggled at times. But I hope and believe that you want 
to do your best to improve the level of service there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    One question I have is, you know, does the IRS survey 
taxpayers to better understand, you know, their concerns? And 
if so, how does that process work?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> We do survey taxpayers and on a fairly
regular basis. We've surveyed taxpayers individually, we survey 
practitioners. So we do a fair amount of survey work and have 
for quite some time, in fact, that is how we have focused our 
whole view of what the future of the IRS should look like in 
the work that we're doing so we know what taxpayers want and 
need and how they want to get that information, et cetera. We 
have that information available to us.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi"> But do you do the survey or do you have
third parties do these surveys?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> We get them through surveys we do ourselves.
We get them through surveys that are done for us. So we have 
multiple ways of getting that information and data.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi"> And these percentages that you folks
quote, the 70, 80 percent, and so forth, who actually 
completes--how is that percentage computed?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> It's a model that we've--we have that we've
agreed with our auditors on in terms of how it is calculated. 
It goes back, you know, almost 20 years. And so, yes, it's a 
model that we use. We know exactly how--what our demand is, how 
many people try to get in, how many people weren't able to get 
in, how many people got cut off, et cetera. All that goes into 
the level of service number that I've mentioned.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Right. Let me just suggest that perhaps
you folks may want to take another look at this model of how 
you survey taxpayers to determine what is really underlying 
their concerns, you know, what is working, what is not working, 
and with regard to what is working, learning from those best 
practices. What is not working, we have to kind of deal with 
it. And I know from personal experience as a former small 
business owner, as well as people I have worked with, you know, 
there is just a kind of a--how do I say it--kind of a 
frustration that they are not being heard sometimes. And so I 
think I respectfully submit that perhaps you should go back and 
take a look at these customer survey methodologies, as well as 
those percentages that you compute, because I am not sure that 
they are consistent with how people perceive the IRS. And I 
think that if you did that, it might be, you know, a salutary 
benefit for all of us really.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Ms. Lucas-Judy, I have a question. Do you folks kind of try 
to get a sense of what are the best practices of the IRS and, 
you know, how to learn from them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. One of the things you're talking about, the 
customer service in looking at surveys and models, one of the 
things that we have recommended for a long time that IRS do is 
compare its phone service with best in the business ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Right. Right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    Ms. Lucas-Judy.--you know, try to do some sort of 
benchmarking.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. Initially, when we made the recommendation, 
IRS did not agree with it. They thought that, okay, they're the 
only ones who provide that kind of service ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    Ms. Lucas-Judy.--and there's nobody really comparable out 
there to look at. But I'm pleased to say that in working with 
IRS over the last couple of years on this, they've come around 
and decided that it actually would be worthwhile to do a 
benchmarking study. And, in fact, they completed the study and 
we're reviewing it now to try to see-- because you can never 
get to 100 percent. You would love to be able to answer 100 
percent of the calls, never have anybody get a busy signal, but 
that's not realistic. And so we were hoping that they can look 
at what other industries do to figure out what is a good level 
of service, what is a good target to strive for.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Yes, I think it is really important to
borrow from what we learn in the private sector about 
benchmarking against the best practices out there for customer 
service and just generally, you know, how do you handle such a 
large volume of calls and make sure that people are treated 
fairly, with respect, with dignity and responsiveness?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">And so if you leave with anything today, I would just 
respectfully submit that there has to be a bigger emphasis on 
that going forward because at this time, I mean, given how 
people perceive government and the IRS, we can't afford for 
them to--their trust to further erode. And so I would 
respectfully, you know, request you folks to really take a hard 
look at this and do some soul-searching on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    Thank you. I yield back.

wish you well in your retirement. I hope it goes well for you, 
sir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">    Let me ask you, in 2016, Commissioner Koskinen testified 
that as he computed, the return investment for enforcement 
operations is roughly $4 for every $1 spent on enforcement. Can 
you enlighten the committee as to how that calculation was 
made? Because I understand that the number was thrown out there 
but there is no description of how that calculation was--that 
return investment was calculated.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Actually, I'd be happy to get the
calculation and submit it back to the record. I can't describe 
it specifically, but basically let me give some general ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Well, rather than take up a lot of time, if
you would submit that to the committee, that would be

    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Sure. Certainly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> I would like to see that. That would be--I am

    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> We've had a very difficult time finding any
way to measure that. We've tried over the years, but to be 
honest, we've never come up with a legitimate measure of return 
on investment for service activities.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Okay. Enforcement comprises about 43 percent
of your budget as of this year, $11.2 billion, which is roughly 
$5 billion just doing quick a government math. You spoke of 
moving $30 million from enforcement to customer service.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> With all due respect, I mean, of a budget of
$5 billion for enforcement, moving $30 million is like the 
light bill for the week. I mean do we really seriously think 
that is going to make an impact on it--from business, $30 
million of $5 billion isn't much.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, it's $30 million against a $2 billion
budget for taxpayer service, so it's a bigger percentage for 
them. Having said that, though, it's not a huge amount. It's 
what was necessary to reach certain levels of either inventory 
or levels of service on the phone, et cetera. So we had the 
additional $290 million that Congress gave us, which $178 
million of it was dedicated to taxpayer service. We had some 
monies from user fees that we put into taxpayer services, and 
then in addition to that we still had a shortfall in terms of 
where we wanted to be in terms of levels of service, and we 
were able to move another $30 million out of enforcement into 
taxpayer service. Now ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> And even after moving the money, you still
end up with significant shortfalls of reasonable customer 
service response.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, for this year, as I said, we're very
close to--we're between 75 and 80 percent on our telephone 
level of service. Our inventories and correspondence are the 
lowest they've been in four years. Generally speaking, taxpayer 
services here is the best it's been in the last five or six 
years. And I can't really speak prior to that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Well, let me suggest that--I mean, part of
the frustration that my colleagues noted about the reputation 
of the IRS is the difficulty people have, as you have already 
heard, getting someone to answer the phone. Now, for the world 
of the private sector, we actually had standards of that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Calls were answered in three to four rings.
In fact, we actually had secret shoppers that went around and 
shopped it to see if calls were answered, and when they were 
answered, did they get their questions responded to.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> It seems to me that you haven't set the same
kinds of standards that we would expect in the private business 
world.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> We actually do some of that. We have quality
reviewers that shop the lines, listen for responses, whether 
they're correct or not. You know, we are not in business for a 
profit so we don't really want to answer the telephone in--on 
the first or second ring because what that means is you are 
actually waiting for the next call to come in.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Well, what is your standard for answering the
phone?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> We would love to be at about an 85 to 86
percent level of service, which would mean basically that 
people were waiting less than a minute or two to get the next 
assister on the line.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Now, I am new here ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> And we've been there before. We have
achieved that in the past.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> When were you there last?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> In the--you know, I--just a little history
here. I left the--I retired from the service before in 2006.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> And you came back?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> And I came back. I was asked to come back. I
was also--at one point in time the Commissioner Wage and 
Investment Division, which handles all of our telephone 
services. When I was Commissioner of the Wage and Investment 
Division, our telephone service was in the high 80s, and at 
that point in time we started to drift into the high 90s. We 
actually found out that we had employees waiting for the next 
call, which is not an efficient way for a government to run 
their telephone systems. So about 85 to 87 percent we found out 
was really the right place to be if we could get our telephone 
service to that level.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Well, my time is expired. I thank the chair.
And let me wish you well again in your retirement, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I appreciate that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> The gentleman from Florida is recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">    Mr. Dalrymple, the news just broke this afternoon that two 
years after the fact the IRS has located almost 7,000 documents 
that are related to the targeting of conservative groups. Are 
you familiar with those documents?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I am not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"> Are you familiar with the news report?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I am not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"> We would like to know on our committee if you
can get us an answer ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Sure.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">--whether those are documents that have
previously been provided to this committee or to other 
committees in the Congress ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I'll find that out.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">--because we went through this for years and
years and there were a lot of emails that were destroyed, there 
were backup tapes, and it was really, really frustrating to do 
that experience.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"> We have asked, a number of us on the
committee, for the President to make a change at the IRS to 
really bring in some new blood so we can start reforming the 
agency. And the targeting was one of the issues and how the 
agency responded to that, but there is also issues that we see 
about really a contempt for the taxpayer. I mean, the agency 
will go and they will, you know, try to get taxpayers dead to 
rights on producing their taxes and all this other stuff, but 
then you have employees--you had a single IRS employee that 
spent, according to a Senate Committee on Finance report, spent 
$43,000 staying at the Ritz-Carlton in Pentagon City. How is 
that acceptable?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I'm not familiar with a report that says
that we had an IRS employee that spent $43,000 staying at the 
Ritz-Carlton.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"> It was over the course of a year. It was a
lot of stays obviously, but that is the ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, I have to assume that the Ritz-Carlton
was offering government rate per diem at that location is all I 
can assume, but I don't know the particulars around that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">Well, it would be the type of thing that I
think it would be tough for that to have been the most 
appropriate thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">    You also had--again, this is the same report, the Senate 
Finance Committee, IRS employee rented a $1 million townhome in 
Arlington for almost $5,000 a month with tax dollars. I mean, 
how is that acceptable?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Again, I'm not really familiar with that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">Okay. Well, this is I think frustrating for
us. And I know there are a lot of taxpayers that they don't 
feel that they always get the benefit of the doubt from the 
IRS. In fact, when Congress reduced the budget for the IRS in 
response to the targeting, there was a major drop-off in 
customer service. It was very difficult for the people, the 
taxpayers to get through. So the bureaucracy was really not 
affected. It was all put on the taxpayer. And you had people 
that really couldn't get their questions answered, and that 
obviously has a lot of effects for our economy and for their 
well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">Ms. Lucas-Judy, let me ask you this. What are the metrics 
that the IRS uses to assess customer service, to measure it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. The primary one is the one we've been 
talking about, the telephone level of service, but they also 
for correspondence--for paper correspondence they track the 
percentage of--the backlog. They track the percentage that are 
what they call over-age, so those that are 45 days or older. 
They track the traffic to the different services that they 
provide online, as well as ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">Does it track whether people are satisfied
with their level of service?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. That I think would be a question that I 
would defer to Mr. Dalrymple.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Actually, we do--we survey every taxpayer
that we have contact with on a satisfaction survey, so the 
answer is yes, we do.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"> Okay. And so you keep--do you know what
percentage of callers are satisfied?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Actually, the number's quite high so--but I
don't know what it is off the top of my head, but I could get 
that for you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"> Now, did we satisfactorily answer your
question? Is that kind of the way you go about it in terms of 
customer service?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> It's a series of questions that try to get
at how satisfied the taxpayer was with the interaction that 
they had.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">Ms. Lucas-Judy, what are the GAO
recommendations, if any, about--are there other metrics that 
can be used so that the IRS can better understand the issue 
with customer service?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">Ms. Lucas-Judy. Well, we've made a number of 
recommendations, including that they have a comprehensive 
customer service strategy to help them determine overall among 
telephones, correspondence, walk-in, online, what they're 
looking for ideally and what's the most efficient, most 
effective way to get to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">    We've also made recommendations that they have other 
metrics for correspondence, that they include performance 
targets for their correspondence. And in addition, we've got 
some recommendations--we've made some suggestions to Congress 
that would help IRS as well in terms of having authority to 
adjust or correct math errors that they see.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. DeSantis"> Great. My time is up. Mr. Chairman, these
emails, we need the answers on those emails ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Sure do.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">--and see, were they responsive to us then not
provided? And they may have been provided because this is in 
the context of a FOIA suit with Judicial Watch, but even within 
the context of that FOIA suit, this is two years late where 
they said they didn't have them and now all of a sudden they 
are producing them. And so ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> No, we will ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DeSantis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. DeSantis">--that obviously is troubling. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Jordan">Well, sir, I thank the gentleman for raising
that issue and the others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Jordan">    Do you need congressional authority to move user fee 
dollars around, Mr. Dalrymple?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> No, that authority was granted to us back in
the '90s to be able to use that ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> You can use it wherever you want?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> You can use it on customer service?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Did you focus in on customer service or were
some of those user fees moved over to implement the Affordable 
Care Act?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> We used--we did have to use user fees for
the Affordable Care Act, FATCA, the FAST Act, the PATH Act, the 
HTCs, the human--HCTC. We've had a number of ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> But of those acts, which one would you have
used more--which one was probably the bigger hurdle or the one 
that required most of the user fee dollars? Would it be the 
Affordable Care Act?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> It would be a guess for me to answer that. I
can find out for certain ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Well, give me your best guess. You have worked
there a few years.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I would guess--I would have guessed it would
have been the ACA.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Jordan">Yes, so would I. So would I. So that could have
contributed to the terrible customer service that taxpayers 
were receiving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Jordan">    You mentioned earlier that ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> But that's a legislative mandate.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> No, I understand.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> I understand.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Yes. The ability to use the user fees or the
ACA or both?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Both.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Right. I understand that. But the ACA is one I
didn't vote for.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I can't ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> I didn't vote for the user fee, the ability to
move the user fees because I wasn't here.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I appreciate that. Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> You mentioned earlier that the budget has been
reduced at the IRS and that, as a result of that, there is 
17,000 less people working at the IRS. Is that accurate?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> That's accurate, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Okay. I mean, that is reflecting your testimony
in an accurate way, I think. What time frame are you talking 
about, that 17,000?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I believe that's between 2010 and 2016.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> And that 17,000 were because you received fewer
dollars in your budget. Were those people let go? Were they 
fired? Were they said, dismissed?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Most of them were either--have retired and
not hired behind or we didn't bring as many temporary or 
seasonal employees on because that's ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> So no one was actually told to hit the road?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> We did--there was no riff if that's what
you're asking.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> That is exactly what I am asking.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> No, not to my knowledge.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Again, I didn't report back to the IRS until
2013, but I don't believe there was a riff.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> So people retired, you just didn't rehire?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> That's right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Or hire people that would have come back
from a seasonal job, so that is a bit different. If you're a 
seasonal employee with us, we don't have to offer your season 
back to you, and in instances like that ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> No, I understand. You probably hire a few more
people at tax season than other times of the year I can guess.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> A lot more, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Jordan">Right. I get that. Okay. If he is ready, we
will get Mr. Grothman. We will just be at ease for a second 
while we wait for the gentleman from Wisconsin to come back. Is 
Glenn coming?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Jordan">    The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> I know, you know, you certainly keep track of
the quality of your folks and I hope you do. Years ago, I used 
to do taxes. And at the time not just me, other people felt 
compared to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, because 
obviously we dealt with them both, that if you talk to your 
guys on the phone, they weren't always the sharpest. They 
didn't know their own laws. You know, you would call them three 
times and you would get three different answers. Well, you call 
them twice, you get two different answers anyway. Do you 
monitor the quality of your folks? I haven't done taxes for 20 
years, but do you have an opinion as to whether your folks know 
what the law is?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes. Actually, we do monitor their--every
call is--can be monitored. We have a quality review system that 
statistically selects calls at random for quality assurance, 
and during that process, we determine whether--one of the main 
things we're looking for is did the taxpayer get the correct 
answer. And actually, we do quite well there. So if you get 
through to us, you're going to get pretty high quality.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Has it improved over time?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> It's really been pretty stable over time, in
the high 90 percent rage.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> How long have you been monitoring it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> At least 20 years. And 20 years ago it was
actually quite low. Probably for the last 10 or 15 years it's 
been quite high.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Better than 20 years ago, you have improved.
Some of the stuff they want to know here is the amount that can 
be spent traveling by employees and, you know, it says here 
Federal employees can spend over $7,000 per month on lodging. 
Do you keep track of that or what is your travel policy for 
your people when they get around?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, first--well, travel policy isn't set
by the IRS; it's set by--you know, government-wide by ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Right, right, I understand.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">--the GSA. So we do monitor, and we actually
monitor how many people are traveling at any time and how long 
they're traveling. And we don't generally have very many people 
traveling for extended periods unless they're on some project. 
But that's typically what we monitor.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> And how does it work? If somebody goes out
there for a week or whatever, I mean, how much are they allowed 
to spend? Who determines where they stay, that sort of thing?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> It's based on the per diem rate, so if they
find a place to stay within the per diem rates, then, you know, 
they're--we don't ask them, you know, where they're staying or 
prohibit them from staying in places that are within those ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">--rates.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Grothman">I am going to give you a more open-ended
question, and any one of you can answer it. And in part I think 
of the earned income tax credit, but in any event, people are 
always--you know, have ideas how to use the tax code for more 
and more things. Hopefully, this time around we use it for less 
and less, but historically, Congress always liked to use it for 
more and more. And I sometimes think when Congressmen propose 
things, they don't think how it is going to look to the 
Internal Revenue Service who has to deal with it, like somebody 
once came up with the earned income tax credit and they 
apparently didn't think of the fact that if you fill out a form 
and get a $5,000 check, fill out an easy form, a lot of people 
will take a crack at it, which is why the fraud is so high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Grothman">    But do you have any comments on the earned income tax 
credit? Or are there any other parts of the tax forms that you 
feel invites cheating or I guess I would say would require you 
to spend a lot more on compliance than you would want to?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Anything that is a refundable credit has
always been a challenge for the Internal Revenue Service so 
whether it's the earned income tax credit or the advanced child 
tax credit, anything that actually is refundable back to the 
taxpayer. And by the way, there are corporate refundable 
credits, too. They're not just to individuals.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> They cause us difficulty from a compliance
standpoint.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Okay. So when you retire and run for
Congress, you are going to take a swing at these things?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I am not running for Congress.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Oh. But you would take a swing at these
things?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I don't know that I'd take a swing at them
because, you know, there are reasons for them I understand. But 
from a tax standpoint they are challenging.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> From a compliance standpoint they require a
lot of your resources, and the reason they require a lot of 
your resources is they invite fraud, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">They invite confusion and fraud both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. The GAO has reported that EITC does have a 
very high improper payment rate, and part of the reason for 
that is the complexity of the credit itself. And it's also 
self-reported.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Right. It would be easy if one wanted to
cheat to try to cheat, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">Right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple">    Ms. Lucas-Judy. That's one of the reasons I think that IRS 
does audit--a lot of audits of EITC returns.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> What happens when you find somebody has
gotten a few thousand dollars they shouldn't get?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, what we try to do is actually find out
that before they get the money back, so we do--most of those 
audits that were referred to are pre-refund audits. We do over 
300,000 of those every year, so we're stopping the refund from 
going out on the front end. It's very, very unlikely to get an 
EITC refund back if it's given to a taxpayer.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Once it is out, it is gone, huh?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> It is very difficult to get it back at that
point.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Do you ever try to do anything with those
people?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I'm sorry?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Do you ever try to do anything with those
people? I mean ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Grothman">--if somebody--if it is very apparent that
somebody is claiming a credit they shouldn't get, does anything 
happen to the people who do that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Well, actually, we bar them from getting the
credit then afterwards. The other thing that would be 
incredibly helpful would be to have correctible error authority 
around earned income tax credit in terms--because we have to do 
examinations on all of these. If we had correctible error 
authority, the process would be much easier to stop the refunds 
when we saw them.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> What does that mean, correctible error
authority?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> It means that when it's an obvious error on
the return, we can actually reverse the credit that's being 
asked for as opposed to having to do a full examination to be 
able to stop the credit.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Okay. I know my chairman is indulging me, but
you know I love this committee.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> That is good.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> I will give you one more--can I have one more
question?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> You sure can.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> If there is one business, refundable business
tax credit or one corporate tax credit, refundable credit that 
you feel is prone to be given erroneously, what would it be, if 
something comes to mind? You mentioned it is not just earned 
income tax credit; there are business credits, too.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> I can't think of one off the top of my head,
but I'd be happy to come back to you with ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Yes, think of some so we can--yes. And how
many of the EITCs percentagewise did you guys review do you 
think are fraudulent or erroneous? I should put it that way.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes. Because--the point that my colleague
from the GAO made is this is an incredibly complex law for a 
very unsophisticated group of taxpayers. And so a lot of the 
mistakes made are not necessarily fraudulent. They are honest 
mistakes. And then the other thing that you've got here are not 
normal nuclear families, so determining who has the ability to 
claim the dependent, et cetera, all those things are incredibly 
difficult in this environment.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> You are a nice man, Mr. Dalrymple, but I
think you are naive. I think they do it on purpose. But ----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Yes, I don't know that many people would
call me that, but I appreciate that actually.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> You are a nice guy, as we say. Okay. Thank
you much.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Jordan">Let the record show the gentleman kept us
waiting and still got eight minutes of questioning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Jordan">    [Laughter.]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Jordan"> Let me thank our witnesses. And, Mr. Dalrymple,
we want to wish you the best in your retirement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dalrymple</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Dalrymple"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Jordan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Jordan">Thank you for being here on this important
subject and for the important work that you do in uncovering 
what has been happening at the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Jordan">I would ask unanimous consent that members have five 
legislative days to submit questions for the record. Without 
objection, so ordered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Jordan">    The subcommittees stand adjourned.
