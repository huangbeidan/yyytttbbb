    <option>      SOUTH CAROLINA, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON READINESS
    Mr. Wilson. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome you all 
here today and call this unclassified hearing of the House 
Armed Services Committee, Readiness Subcommittee, on ``The 
Current State of the United States Marine Corps'' to order.
    The consistent theme of the 115th congressional session of 
the House Armed Services Committee is to continue the drumbeat 
of our current state of overall military readiness, and in many 
cases, where we are not providing necessary resources to enable 
power projection and exercise the principle I strongly believe, 
and that is peace through strength.
    The Marine Corps currently has over 20 percent of its 
Active Duty force deployed in 37 countries, so you clearly play 
an integral part in deterring adversaries and reassuring our 
allies. And even today, with the chemical attack in Syria, it 
is actually reassuring to me to know that there is a presence 
that can help the people of that war-torn tragic country.
    Over the past several weeks, both of our full committee and 
this subcommittee have listened keenly to briefings and 
hearings from leading national security experts and senior 
military leaders describing the current threats we face and the 
current state of the military. After listening to these 
sobering assessments, there is no question in my mind we are 
sadly, indeed, in a readiness crisis.
    In addition, earlier this morning, we received testimony 
from each of the service chiefs on the consequences of another 
continuing resolution. This continuing resolution would only 
worsen the damage to our military and its readiness.
    The Marine Corps provides our Nation with a versatile set 
of capabilities, ranging from crisis response, amphibious 
operations, and theater security cooperation. We must assist 
your efforts to restore readiness where it is lacking for 
today's threats and integrate necessary skills to address 
tomorrow's challenges.
    I am personally concerned about the lasting impacts 
incurred as a result of the Marine Corps prioritization, quote, 
``near-term readiness,'' end of quote, at the expense of other 
areas, such as capacity, capability, modernization, and 
facility sustainment.
    I believe the first responsibility of the Federal 
Government is to secure its citizens, and therefore, it is our 
duty to better understand the readiness situation the Marine 
Corps finds itself in and then aid in that recovery.
    This is especially appropriate since the originally 
required by the 82nd Congress and subsequently referred by the 
114th Congress, the Marine Corps is the, quote, ``Nation's 
expeditionary force of readiness,'' end of quote.
    This afternoon, we are honored and grateful to have 
Lieutenant General Ron Bailey, United States Marine Deputy 
Commandant, Plans, Policies, and Operations.
    We have Lieutenant General Mike Dana, the U.S. Marine Corps 
Deputy Commandant of Installations and Logistics; and senior 
executive servant, William E. Taylor, the Assistant Deputy 
Commandant for Aviation.
    I want to thank each of you for your admirable and 
extraordinary service to the Corps and this Nation. I believe 
it is worth noting that our panel--this is amazing--has 110 
years of combined experience, and this will be extremely 
helpful as this subcommittee seeks to address readiness 
challenges moving forward.
    We now ask the senior leaders of the Marine Corps here 
today to offer us their candid and best military advice related 
to the current state of readiness, which includes home 
facility--home station facilities, deployed force capabilities, 
and those units training to be the next to go forward in harm's 
way.
    We look forward to hearing from our witnesses, and thank 
you for testifying today as you highlight the current state of 
the Marine Corps readiness.
    I now would like to turn to the ranking member, 
Representative Joe Courtney, from Connecticut, for any opening 
remarks he would like to make.

    Mr. Courtney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would only edit 
your comment by saying I am the temporary ranking member of the 
subcommittee, because Ms. Bordallo, again, is back home in Guam 
taking care of some family affairs, and obviously other work in 
her home district.
    She has a written statement, which, again, I would just, 
again, ask to be entered for the record.

    <option>Appendix on page 25.]
    Mr. Courtney. And she did ask me just to read a very brief 
comment as well, which is that she, again, is unable to be here 
today, but she communicated that she is looking forward to 
seeing the Marine realignment to Guam continue forward without 
delay. The Marine Corps and the Department of Defense should 
take necessary steps to ensure that the challenges are being 
promptly and adequately addressed.
    So I am sure it is going to come as a great shock to all of 
us that she did want to talk about Guam a little bit in her 
comments here. And, again, I had a chance to meet with these 
gentlemen in the office and want to, again, thank them for the 
great testimony you are about to prepare here today.
    General Neller, again, did an excellent job this morning. 
It is my understanding he flew in at 5:00 this morning from 
overseas and got to the committee. So he deserves bonus points 
for, again, his efforts this morning and his concise comments, 
which was also really, I think, very effective in terms of his 
presentation here.
    So, again, thank you, again, to the witnesses. And with 
that, I would yield back.
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Congressman Courtney.
    And indeed, we are really grateful for the service of 
Delegate Madeleine Bordallo. At this time of the year, she 
provides a report to the people of Guam, and so it is a 
tradition that she so effectively represents the very patriotic 
people of the territory of Guam.
    Now, we will be proceeding with the combined opening 
statement from the panel being delivered by Lieutenant General 
Bailey.
