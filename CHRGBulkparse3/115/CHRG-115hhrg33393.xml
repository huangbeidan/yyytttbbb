    <SubmittedMaterial>Brady [Chairman of the Committee] presiding [The advisory announcing the hearing follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman BRADY The Committee will come to order Good morning And thank you all for joining us And today our Committee is focused on a top priority for the American people</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>progrowth tax reform that will create jobs increase</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>paychecks</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and strengthen our Nation's economy America now has</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>one of the most costly</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>unfair and uncompetitive tax systems</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>in the world The need for progrowth tax reform is urgent Today's high tax rates on American businesses drive good paying jobs overseas It makes it much more difficult for our job creators and our workers to succeed here at home America's burdensome international tax system destroys US competitiveness and discourages investment in our local communities Scores of loopholes give favored treatment to Washington's special interests while millions of hardworking Americans haven't seen a real pay raise in years Here is the good news: President Trump is leading the charge for bold tax reform that will unleash the growth of jobs and paychecks nationwide</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and he is calling on The House and</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>the Senate to put forward our best ideas Our Committee is ready to answer that call Over the past several years</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>we have held roughly  full</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>Committee and Subcommittee hearings on all aspects of tax reform All of our Members</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>no matter what side of the dais you</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>sit on</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>know that tax reform is an economic imperative Now is the time to go bold Now is the time to deliver real</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>results for the American people We welcome all serious solutions that will help achieve that goal While there is no perfect way to tax</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>there are proven</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>solutions to grow our economy and improve the lives of all Americans</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>especially the middle class So let's take a look at</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>the numbers Currently</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>we have the highest corporate tax rate</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>in the developed world at  percent For small businesses</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>it</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>is worse The rates can be as high as  percent To unleash job creation</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>increase middle class paychecks we know these</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>rates have to come down Washington must take less from American job creators so they can invest more in their businesses</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>their workers and their futures In addition to lowering rates we also know that bold</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>policies</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>such as full and immediate expensing are incredibly</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>progrowth for jobs</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>for paychecks and for our economy as a</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>whole According to estimates from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>this provision alone allowing businesses of all</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>sizes to immediately write off their business investment in buildings</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>equipment software and technology</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>create  million fulltime jobs</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and raise wages and paychecks</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>significantly Finally</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>the numbers show us that businesses of all sizes</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>are eager for tax reform They are ready for the opportunity to innovate</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>to grow and to hire new workers Recently the</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>Business Roundtable surveyed a group of more than  CEOs about tax reform:  percent of them said tax reform will prompt companies to increase business investment</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and three out</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>of four said they will increase hiring These CEO responses make clear that tax reform will create jobs</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>create paychecks</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>and grow our economy But make no mistake: There are also consequences if we fail to act Ninety percent of the CEOs said that delaying tax reform will harm the US by causing slower growth</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>slower</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>hiring</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and slower capital investment And more than that</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>delay would force all Americans to continue to live with a Tax Code that works against them</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>not for them Take from Roger and Natalie Goertz constituents of mine</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>who own and operate a Mr Rooter plumbing franchise in Montgomery County</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>Texas Roger who is a friend and his wife</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>who are so deeply involved in the community</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>said: As a small</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>business owner</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>I am scared to death each year in how I am</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>going to have to pay into the government That uncertainty is devastating</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>he says It is kind of like trying to operate your</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>business with one hand tied behind your back; sometimes you feel like both hands are tied behind your back All small businesses know that feeling In today's hearing</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>we will hear from more business</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>leaders</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>real live business leaders about exactly what is</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>needed to get jobs</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>paychecks and the economy moving again Our witnesses are toplevel executives from American</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>companies of all size</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>from  workers to  middle class</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>workers Their expertise will help us understand how different proposals will impact America's job creators</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>workers and our</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>families Since releasing our House Blueprint for Tax Reform last June</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>we have received thousands of comments from</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>businesses and thought leaders</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>feedback we take very</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>seriously We look forward to the expert guidance our witnesses will provide today We thank you all for being here to lend us your insight Again</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>there is no perfect way to tax But there are proven</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>ways to grow our economy With today's hearing</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>we will take a</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>critical step toward putting these ideas into action for the American people With that</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>I will now recognize Ranking Member Neal for his</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>opening statement Mr Neal Mr NEAL Thank you</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>Mr Chairman for holding this</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>important hearing and highlighting the need for tax reform We all agree the Tax Code is broken It is far too complicated and certainly in need of repair Our current tax system isn't working for families and businesses alike</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and we all agree</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>that any revisions to the Code should promote economic growth and create jobs for working families However</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>we should reject ideology and work together to</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>reform our tax system for the st century According to a recent Pew studybased on fact</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>not opinionthe share of</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>adults living in middleincome households in the United States fell from  to  percent from  to  Aggregate household income has also shifted from the middle to the upperincome households Pew's research found that  percent of US aggregate income went to the upperincome households in</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>up from  percent in  And for middleincome</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>households</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>the share of income was  percent in  down</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>from  percent in Wealth is now concentrated at the top</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and I assume there</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>is broad agreement on that issue We can disagree on how that happened but not to miss the point greater concentrated wealth at the top is a reality as we proceed to this discussion Income stagnation is a real challenge and one that needs to be addressed in tax reform This is in part why working families sent a strong signal to Congress last November They haven't received a pay raise in years Their bills are piling up</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and they are concerned about uncertain financial</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>security Put simply</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>too many feel forgotten and left out by</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>their government Tax reform should be about moving the dial to help middle class families prosper That means focusing on job creation and helping families with daytoday costs</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>like</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>housing costs</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>grocery bills and childcare It also means</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>helping working families to buy their first home</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>to send their</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>children to college</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and help care for their elderly parents</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>And</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>of course it also means helping families save for</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>retirement</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and that means protecting the tax incentives in the</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>Code for retirement savings Our focus should be on making sure that when our American families sit down around the dinner table</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>they can look across</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>at their spouse</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>or their partner and their children and know</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>that things are going to be all right That is not the case in too many homes across the country today</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and that needs to be</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>addressed That is why Democrats are committed to ensuring that middle class tax reform is the true winner in any tax reform proposal The American people don't believe that massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires grow the economy The American family knows that tax reform that provides middle class tax relief and asks corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay their share is what will grow our economy We will oppose any tax plan that simply helps the rich get richer and does nothing for those who really need our help And all of us should oppose any tax reform that results in a greater burden on the middle class The Trump tax plan currently fails to meet this standard</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and I hope the</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>Administration will move back to the test that was set out by Secretary Mnuchin for tax reform</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>which he stated quote ``There will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class'' Furthermore</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>must be done in a responsible manner To that end</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>words like</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>dynamic scoring and supplyside economics are thrown around a lot these days But make no mistake</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>tax cuts do not pay for</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>themselves and anything to the contrary is a nonstarter However</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>as we consider tax policy and economywide</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>effects</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>I would argue the importance of considering the</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>macroeconomic effects of other policy changes</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>including an</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>acknowledgment that robust investment in our Nation's infrastructure would have significant growth effects throughout our economy I also think that we should think about using the revenue from a deemed repatriation tax to pay for infrastructure and for other productive investment purposes In conclusion</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>we have a unique opportunity to sit down and</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>work together on tax reform After all</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>we all agree that the</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>current system is inefficient and underproductive I stand ready to work in good faith on tax reform with our Republican allies and friends in Congress and also the Administration</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>and</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>only if we do and make the effort to assist the middle class Thank you</SubmittedMaterial>
    <peopleinfo>Mr Chairman for calling this hearing We look</peopleinfo>
    <SubmittedMaterial>forward to calling our witnesses as they join us today And we look forward to a continued and productive conversation Chairman BRADY Thank you</SubmittedMaterial>

    <option>             AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AT&amp;amp;T INC.
    Mr. STEPHENS. Thank you, Chairman Brady and Ranking Member 
Neal. And thank you, Members of the Committee. I appreciate the 
opportunity to be in front of you today.
    I am John Stephens. I am the chief financial officer of 
AT&amp;amp;T, and I sincerely appreciate this opportunity to discuss 
the importance of enacting comprehensive corporate tax reform 
with you today.
    AT&amp;amp;T is a company with a 140-year heritage of research and 
innovation that includes eight Nobel Prizes and more than 
15,000 patents and pending patents worldwide. We employ more 
than 200,000 people here in the United States. And over the 
past 5 years, we have invested more in the U.S. economy, than 
any other public company, right at $135 billion.
    One of the biggest issues facing this country is how to 
unleash economic growth which has underperformed for the last 
decade. We can and should do better. The key driver of U.S. 
economic growth is private sector investment. When investment 
increases, so does economic activity, hiring and wages. And 
when more people are working and making more money, they have 
more money to spend.
    However, private sector investment in the U.S., measured as 
a percentage of GDP, is at its lowest level in generations. It 
is not surprising that the U.S. economy has been marred in 
sluggish growth for nearly a decade. If we are serious about 
robust growth, then we must get serious about jump-starting 
private sector investment. And the best way to do that is to 
fix our broken, last-century corporate Tax Code.
    Achieving competitive corporate tax rates is likely the 
most effective catalyst available for public policymakers to 
increase capital investment, create jobs, and increase wages.
    Lowering the corporate tax rate will also make the United 
States more competitive globally. We can respond to foreign 
countries that have implemented modern tax policies to 
aggressively compete for our jobs and our investment.
    We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 
comprehensively update the Code for the 21st century and put 
the U.S. back on top.
    First, we need to reduce the top corporate tax rate. This 
is the quickest, most straightforward way to jump start 
investment in our country. We will bring our tax system in line 
with other developed countries. By reducing the rate, simple 
economics will drive companies to invest more in America rather 
than elsewhere.
    Secondly, policymakers should allow for the full expensing 
of capital investments. This is an effective way to quickly 
stimulate the economy. The tax foundation estimates that this 
policy change would create the equivalent of one million full-
time jobs. One hundred percent immediate expensing removes the 
negative effects of taxation on investment. And we know it 
works. Bonus depreciation, a provision with bipartisan support 
from this Committee, allowed accelerated depreciation that 
positively affected our investment decisions in those years. 
Plain and simple, we at AT&amp;amp;T invested more under bonus 
depreciation than we would have otherwise done.
    The ability to fully expense investment would do even more 
to incentivize AT&amp;amp;T and companies throughout the United States 
to accelerate investment. And more investment directly means 
more jobs.
    We recognize that any comprehensive corporate tax reform 
will involve tradeoffs. That is clear. But the key word is 
``comprehensive.'' Any plan being considered should be judged 
in totality, not just by a single provision.
    For example, one area I know the Committee has looked at is 
eliminating interest expense deductibility. Viewed in 
isolation, that provision would be extremely problematic for 
me. But I understand that it may be necessary as part of a 
broader solution. If the Committee plans to eliminate interest 
deductibility, I would encourage you to utilize reasonable 
transition rules that do not penalize past choices companies 
like ours have made under a vastly different tax system. This 
would not only give companies appropriate time to adjust their 
capital structures to the new system but also allow them to 
immediately increase their investment in response to a lower 
overall tax rate.
    Chairman BRADY. Mr. Stephens, thank you for your testimony.

    <option>                          WORKS, INC.
    Mr. MOTTL. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, my 
name is Zach Mottl. I am the chief alignment officer for Atlas 
Tool Works, a fourth-generation, family-owned, small 
manufacturer in Lyons, Illinois. I am here today representing 
not only my own company but also the 750 manufacturers who are 
members of the Technology and Manufacturing Association, TMA, 
in Illinois. These manufacturers, many in Congressman Roskam's 
district, are proud to provide good-paying jobs and careers to 
about 30,000 people in the Chicago area. Most are like mine, 
small- to medium-sized supply chain companies that have 
survived NAFTA, weathered the China tide, and managed through 
the Great Recession.
    Through innovation, modernization, and cost control, we now 
produce more product than we did 20 years ago. Plus, we are 
poised to take advantage of the well-earned opportunity for 
reshoring. We are successfully competing against the best the 
world has to offer, and we are proud to help manufacture the 
wealth of America.
    However, in order to continue our success and grow while 
creating more good-paying jobs for Americans, we need your 
help. I am here today to testify in support of your work to 
comprehensively reform the U.S. Tax Code. I believe this is the 
best and fastest way to grow the U.S. economy and create more 
jobs in America.
    I would like to highlight two things: the opportunity for 
trade competitiveness through tax reform and the unique pain 
felt by small manufacturers due to excessive complexity and 
unfair treatment under the current Code. Today, the most 
difficult barrier to growth American manufacturers face is our 
self-inflicted Tax Code. Much of it, written decades ago, fails 
to account for today's internationally competitive environment.
    I understand that many are going to argue for simply 
reducing the current rates. And this might be helpful in the 
short run, but I believe our economy and our citizens need and 
deserve permanent comprehensive reform that also improves 
America's trade competitiveness. That is why the manufacturers 
I represent are so pleased that this Committee has placed 
border adjustability at the center of its tax reform efforts. 
Nearly every one of our trading partners currently use border 
adjustable consumption taxes, BATs, in the form of value added 
taxes, VATs, or good and services taxes, GSTs. These average 17 
percent globally, and they act as tariff and subsidy 
replacements.
    Most European Union nations have VAT rates between 17 and 
22 percent, and every American exporter into the EU has to pay 
those rates to sell their product there.
    Now when Mexico agreed to NAFTA, they abolished most of 
their tariffs. But, instead, they raised the Mexican VAT to 15 
percent. So they basically built a new tax wall for American 
products.
    India, it is now in the process of adopting a goods and 
services tax.
    Furthermore, any country that wants to mimic a currency 
devaluation can increase their VAT and use the proceeds to 
reduce other domestic taxes.
    In reality, I believe tax policy and trade policy, they go 
hand in hand. And I believe that tax policy has far greater 
effect on trade than any trade agreement ever could. Good tax 
policy, one that encourages domestic production and exports is, 
in effect, good trade policy. Moreover, it is unilateral. We 
don't need to negotiate with anyone. We don't need to ask 
permission from any international trade body, and we don't need 
to risk sparking a trade war.
    Remember, every one of our trading partners has already 
some type of a BAT system. So we simply need to change our tax 
laws and immediately American producers regain their edge, and 
the working men and women can get a tax break. In short, I want 
to get back to a world where American producers compete and win 
on price, quality, and service.
    The second point I want to highlight today is the 
importance of simplifying the Tax Code and reducing the overall 
rate.
    My company, it is like many small manufacturing businesses 
in America. We are often family owned. We usually own our own 
real estate, and we do not have a significant staff of tax 
experts. We work hard to be competitive, create jobs, and pay 
our fair share.
    Consider that small businesses have provided some of the 
fastest employment and output growth in the United States, but 
we receive some of the worst tax treatment under the Code. 
Usually, smaller manufacturers are paying the highest rates 
because we do not have the resources to develop a globally 
comprehensive tax avoidance plan. That is why I believe we must 
reduce the overall rate, offer a reduction in payroll taxes, 
and fund these reductions through BATs.
    It is also important to simplify the Tax Code and avoid 
disadvantaging small businesses, subchapter S and LLCs. These 
types report the taxes on the owners' personal tax reform. The 
calculations, they are excessively complicated.
    My own family business, which together employ about 80 
people, have three different tax structures: one C corp, two S 
corps, and one LLC to hold the real estate.
    TMA member companies like mine and tens of thousands of 
others throughout the United States, we are not looking for a 
handout or an unfair advantage. What we are hoping for is a 
level playing field from our Tax Code and the opportunity to 
earn our prosperity by, again, competing on price, quality, and 
service.
    All we are asking for from Congress is a permanent Tax Code 
that drastically improves our competitiveness through a move 
toward a more simplified and reduced tax system that places the 
emphasis on a border adjustable component. This reform will 
provide a level playing field so that we can dramatically 
increase good-paying American jobs and grow the American 
economy at a rate we have not seen in decades.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide this input. I look 
forward to your questions.

    <option>                 OFFICER, EMERSON ELECTRIC CO.
    Mr. FARR. Thank you very much.
    Good morning, Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and 
distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to appear before you on this critical U.S. economic 
growth issue.
    My name is David Farr. I am chairman and CEO of Emerson in 
St. Louis, Missouri. I serve as the current chairman of the 
National Association of Manufacturers, NAM, Board of Directors.
    Emerson is a $15 billion manufacturing company providing 
innovative products, solutions in industrial, commercial, and 
residential markets. And we have over 80,000 people and 
operations in more than 150 countries. The NAM, the Nation's 
largest industrial trade association, is committed to a policy 
agenda that helps manufacturers grow and create jobs. We 
appreciate the current efforts to advance pro-growth and 
permanent tax reform.
    Manufacturers of the United States struggle to compete and 
win under a tax system with high tax rates and outdated 
international tax rules and a significant tax compliance 
burden. We have the best chance in over 30 years to advance 
significant tax reform and must take full advantage of this 
opportunity. It will enhance U.S. economic growth.
    Since the last major reform in 1986, manufacturers in the 
U.S. have innovated, but the Tax Code has not. With a combined 
statutory corporate tax rate that could top 39 percent, 
manufacturing in the United States faces the highest corporate 
tax rate among OECD nations. And this is a competitive problem. 
And top rates for manufacturers organized as passthrough 
entities can be even higher, and this hurts their investment 
opportunities.
    Over the past 3 years, Emerson paid $1.8 billion annually 
in taxes worldwide. More than half of that was paid in the 
United States. At an average effective tax rate of 
approximately 32 percent and a marginal tax rate of over 37 
percent, Emerson pays real cash taxes here in the United 
States.
    A key NAM objective shared by Emerson is a top Federal tax 
rate of only 15 percent. We must also lower tax rates for 
passthrough entities including many smaller companies in the 
U.S. manufacturing supply chain. Lower rates will make 
manufacturing more competitive, encourage greater investment in 
the United States, and promote job creation, and stronger 
economic growth.
    Outdated and cumbersome tax rules for taxing international 
income represent another major problem. Emerson's business is 
global. More than 52 percent of our sales in 2016 were outside 
the United States. As a U.S. company headquartered in St. 
Louis, Missouri, Emerson typically pays more in taxes on 
worldwide earnings than our foreign competitors. This is 
another competitive issue. Most developed countries have 
territorial systems, and their global companies pay little to 
no tax when they bring their foreign earnings back home. The 
United States, on the other hand, has a worldwide system, 
meaning global U.S. companies, where they do business they pay 
taxes, as well as in the United States when we bring the 
earnings back home. This added tax burden is a significant 
disadvantage when U.S. companies are competing for global 
business.
    To improve U.S. competitiveness, any tax reform plan should 
include a territorial system similar to those in other 
countries where our competitors are headquartered. This will 
increase U.S. jobs, exports, and strengthen U.S.-based 
suppliers and allow for the flow of capital back to the United 
States for investment right here in America.
    A tax reform plan must encourage long-term capital 
investment by allowing accelerated depreciation of newly 
invested assets, one of the most important being the full 
expensing the first year. Expensing lowers the after-tax cost 
to capital, can drive increased investment and economic growth 
along with job growth.
    As the head of a global manufacturing company headquartered 
in St. Louis, Missouri, I strongly support a robust R&amp;amp;D 
incentive. Continuous research and development is critical to 
ensuring that the United States remains a leader in global 
innovation and maintains Americans' competitive advantage in 
technology.
    U.S. manufacturing want the United States to be the best 
place to compete and manufacture in the world. We want to 
attract direct foreign investment. A permanent tax reform that 
reduces the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, provides lower 
tax rates for passthrough entities, moves to a territorial 
system, maintains a strong R&amp;amp;D incentive, and includes faster 
capital cost recovery, will ensure we achieve this goal and 
improve our country's competitiveness and ability to grow.
    We operate in a fiercely competitive global economy, and we 
need a fiercely competitive tax system. And we need it now.
    Emerson and NAM are committed to working with you to 
advance this much-needed tax reform as soon as possible.
    Mr. Chairman and the Committee Members, thank you very much 
for having me here today, and I look forward to the Q&amp;amp;A. Thank 
you.
    Chairman BRADY. Thank you, Mr. Farr.

    Mr. PETERSON. Thank you.
    Good morning. Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal, thank 
you for inviting me to speak. I am grateful for the opportunity 
to share my perspective on how tax reform can help U.S. 
companies of all sizes that are competing in the global 
marketplace.
    I am Doug Peterson, president and chief executive officer 
of S&amp;amp;P Global. Our commitment to transparency, integrity, and 
superior analytics has been at the forefront of U.S. economic 
growth since our founding over 150 years ago as a small 
business. Beginning with the expansion of the Nation's railroad 
system to the rise of the world's most liquid and resilient 
capital markets to the growth of digital information 
technology, S&amp;amp;P Global's essential intelligence has remained 
independent and guided important decisions throughout U.S. 
history.
    Today, I want to thank the Committee for all the work you 
have been doing to reform the Tax Code.
    I offer you my continued support as you move through the 
legislative process.
    My message to you today is twofold.
    First, we need to reform the U.S. tax system, including 
lowering the corporate tax rate, to level the playing field and 
putting in place a more competitive international system.
    Secondly, we need a permanent, comprehensive fix that will 
promote investment, innovation and growth in the U.S. economy 
to support American companies and American workers.
    S&amp;amp;P Global competes on an international level. While we 
have grown significantly since our inception, we have kept most 
of our intellectual property in the U.S., which means we pay a 
large majority of our taxes in the U.S. Since the U.S. 
currently has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among 
the countries in the OECD, at 35 percent, we have a much higher 
effective tax rate than our international competitors. For 
example, Canada has dropped its corporate rate from 36 percent 
to 26 percent, and the United Kingdom will have a rate of 17 
percent by 2020. In fact, throughout S&amp;amp;P Global's history, we 
have consistently paid an effective tax rate of over 30 
percent. While many of our competitors pay in the low teens, 
this high rate hurts our ability to compete against companies 
located in countries where corporate tax rates lower their 
overall costs.
    With a less competitive international system, U.S. 
companies face an uphill battle. Currently, when foreign 
companies establish in a country with a territorial tax system 
to sell goods into the U.S., they pay little, if any, corporate 
tax here. In addition, foreign companies may pay little to no 
corporate tax when they return profits home. In contrast, U.S. 
businesses that sell goods and services to foreign customers 
are taxed fully in the U.S. And more than $2.5 trillion in 
profits from U.S. companies is offshore today, something that 
doesn't happen under other tax systems.
    The basis of our Tax Code was designed after World War II 
when our economy was geared toward manufacturing and 
agriculture. The last rewrite, in 1986, occurred before the 
internet and the information economy, which introduced new 
innovative business models. The emergence of technology, 
advanced manufacturing, modern agriculture, the growth of 
intellectual property, and the globalization of markets, are 
all new features of our economy. The Tax Code, though, has not 
evolved with the economy. The result is a highly unfair system 
that undermines competitiveness. The tax inequities that 
advantage foreign competitors over their American counterparts 
can be traced to this antiquated code. It is time for a change. 
For decades, the United States has been the birthplace of 
innovation and new business formation. We should use this 
opportunity for comprehensive, permanent tax reform to ensure 
it continues to be the engine of growth for small businesses, 
startups, and other American job creators. Today, we are losing 
ground, and we should be leading.
    I hope Congress will seize this moment and enact 
substantial changes that will foster investment, growth, and 
jobs in the U.S.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony, 
and I look forward to having a discussion with you today. Thank 
you very much.
    Chairman BRADY. Thank you, Mr. Peterson.

    Chairman BRADY. Mr. Rattner, you are recognized. Again, 
welcome.
</option>
    <option>                 OFFICER, WILLETT ADVISORS LLC
    Mr. RATTNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member 
Neal for having me here today. I speak as someone who has spent 
35 years in the private sector as an investment manager meeting 
with companies, analyzing companies, investing with companies, 
as well as having spent time in the Treasury in the early part 
of the Obama Administration. And I would certainly concur with 
what every single previous speaker has said about the need for 
comprehensive tax reform after 30 years of neglect.
    However, in my opinion, any major tax legislation should 
meet several important tests. First, it should be deficit 
neutral given projections for rising fiscal gaps. Secondly, it 
should be fair and certainly not diminish the progressivity of 
our system. Thirdly, it should be growth- and investment-
enhancing. Fourthly, it should improve our international 
competitive position.
    On that basis, the proposal by the Administration falls 
short in several important respects.
    While the President's focus on tax reform is laudatory, his 
1-page plan includes far more detail on how the Administration 
would cut taxes than how it would pay for those reductions. 
Based on the information provided, nonpartisan researchers have 
estimated that its net cost could be $5 trillion to $6 trillion 
over the next decade. Without adequate offsets, these tax cuts 
would drive up interest rates, the deficit, and the Federal 
debt. And I would note that the deficit is already rising 
again.
    These projected deficits would be substantially exacerbated 
by the Trump plan. Again, before incorporating the 
Administration's plan, the Committee for a Responsible Federal 
Budget forecasts that the ratio of debt to gross domestic 
product, already at a historic high of just under 80 percent, 
would rise sharply and could reach 89 percent by 2027, above 
every previous high, except for a short period after World War 
II. The Trump plan would drive this ratio to an astounding 111 
percent by 2027 even as we continue to deal with the effects of 
an aging population.
    To counter these concerns, the Trump Administration appears 
to be resurrecting discredited supply-side theory that high 
deficits resulting from tax cuts don't matter because faster 
economic growth will quickly close the gap. That is not what 
happened following the Reagan tax cut of 1981. And by the end 
of Reagan's tenure, roughly two-thirds of his tax reductions 
had been reversed. Nor is it our experience following the tax 
cuts pushed through by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 
2003.
    To pay for the Trump plan, we would need average growth of 
4.5 percent per year. That has not happened on a sustained 
basis in modern history and is highly implausible in the future 
given our current aging and productivity trends. For its part, 
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects 
approximately 2 percent growth for the next decade. Treasury 
Secretary Steven Mnuchin believes that annual growth of 3 
percent is attainable from the Trump plan. I know of no 
independent economist who thinks that is possible. And even if 
it were, the result would be about $2 trillion of additional 
revenues, far short of what is needed.
    Secondly, on fairness: Given the economic strains on middle 
and working class Americans with which we are all familiar, it 
is critical that any tax reform plan be focused on helping 
these Americans. However, the details of the Trump plan 
unassailably contradict Secretary Mnuchin's assertions that 
there would be no net tax cut for the rich. The plan includes 
lowering the top rate on earned income, eliminating a 3.8-
percent levy on investment income, and doing away with the 
estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. Yes, some 
deductions are to be eliminated, most notably for State and 
local taxes. But when the Trump Administration provides enough 
information for experts to score the proposal, I have no doubt 
that the rich will be the big winners.
    Gary Cohn, the Director of the National Economic Council, 
has argued the increase in the standard deduction qualifies Mr. 
Trump's plan as a middle class tax cut. The problem is that a 
family of two or more pays less tax under current law than it 
would under Mr. Trump's plan because of the availability of 
both the standard deduction and personal exemptions, which Mr. 
Trump said in the campaign he would end.
    Thirdly, regarding growth and investment: While the large 
tax cuts could be viewed as enhancing short-term growth, the 
size of Mr. Trump's tax cuts, a lack of progressivity, will 
quickly overwhelm the positive benefits. Most importantly, 
rising interest rates will soon squeeze out private investment. 
The Tax Policy Center has estimated that his plan would reduce 
GDP by half a percent after a decade and 4 percent after two.
    Fourthly, it should enhance our international competitive 
position. I would agree that the need for corporate tax reform 
is without question. While the stated rate for U.S. companies 
is 39 percent, many pay far less because of the use of 
avoidance techniques. As a result, the average corporate tax 
rate is 10 to 15 percent--10 to 15 points lower less than the 
statutory rate. That is unfair to many stakeholders. What 
should be done is a thorough elimination of abusive practices, 
such as transfer pricing, in return for lowering of the 
standard rate to 25 percent, which is in line with the OECDs 
unweighted average.
    I would like, during the questions, to talk more about 
issues like the trapped cash that were referred to in the 
earlier comments. But, for the moment, I would close by simply 
agreeing, again, that a comprehensive tax bill is long overdue. 
But it needs to be deficit neutral, and it needs to be fairer 
to the average American as well as reforming our corporate tax 
system.
    Thank you very much.
    Chairman BRADY. Thank you, Mr. Rattner.
