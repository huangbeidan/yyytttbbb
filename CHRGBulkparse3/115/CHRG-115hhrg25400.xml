    <peopleinfo>you are recognized for  minutes STATEMENTS OF LINDA RUSCHE DIRECTOR OFFICE OF CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT</peopleinfo>
    <option>    Ms. RUSCHE. Good morning. And thank you, Chairman Chabot 
and Ranking Member Velazquez. Thank you for the opportunity to 
come and speak with you today and to testify before the entire 
Committee on the Office of Credit Risk Management of the Small 
Business Administration. As director of OCRM, I am responsible 
for the oversight and the risk management of SBA's lending 
programs and the guaranteed loan portfolios delivered by our 
7(a) and 504 lending partners.
    SBA's administrator, Linda McMahon, has demonstrated 
leadership in championing small business lending while 
maintaining prudent lending standards. SBA is particularly 
interested in balancing the growing credit needs of America's 
small businesses with prudent lending, always ensuring that we 
are meeting the requirements of our mission, as authorized by 
the Small Business Act. The Office of Credit Risk Management is 
to effectively manage program risk, monitor lender performance, 
and enforce loan program requirements. In short, to maintain 
the integrity and the viability of the programs.
    How does OCRM manage all 7(a) lenders and certified 
development companies and over $1 billion in credit? Our first 
step is through use of our loan and lender monitoring system 
which tracks monthly performance of every loans, assigns a 
quarterly credit score for each loan, and then rolls that into 
a quarterly purchase rating for each lender based on those 
loans. This provides an initial risk profile for each lender 
and CDC and allows OCRM to bucket higher risk lenders and CDCs 
for additional monitoring.
    Next, OCRM uses our composite risk measurement methodology 
that we call PARRiS for 7(a) lenders, SMART for CDCs, to 
further diagnose our higher risk lenders. Benchmarks of 
historical and projected performance have been developed for 
PARRiS and SMART and provide relative measures of individual 
lenders' financial risk.
    Third, OCRM conducts approximately 300 focused, risk-based 
exams and reviews every year using these protocols. OCRM also 
conducts over 1,200 assessments each year before renewing 
delegated authority status for those lenders and CDCs which 
have been granted enhanced authority by SBA. And we also 
conduct quarterly financial and capital assessments of our SBA 
supervised lenders, since SBA is generally their sole Federal 
financial regulator.
    OCRM has been at the forefront of identifying emerging 
risks, one of which involves the ongoing discussion of which 
businesses are in need of SBA financing. The Small Business 
Act, as amended, states that small business loan guarantees are 
to be provided only to those borrowers who cannot obtain needed 
credit on reasonable terms from other Federal sources--I am 
sorry, other non-Federal sources. With recent robust growth of 
the 7(a) program, OCRM has paid particular attention in its 
reviews to a lender's documented credit elsewhere reasons. We 
have identified some instances of lack of understanding on the 
part of lenders and occasionally poor internal controls within 
lender operations which contribute to some noncompliance. OCRM 
requires those lenders which demonstrating noncompliance to 
correct individual file deficiencies, and as needed, to alter 
policies, procedures, or internal controls to ensure full 
compliance. OCRM will continue to focus on this on this area in 
our upcoming reviews to ensure the mission of the agency is met 
in providing small businesses financing they cannot obtain 
elsewhere on reasonable terms.
    Thank you for the opportunity to share this information. I 
will be happy to respond to your questions.
    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much.
    And Mr. Manger, you are recognized for 5 minutes. It is 
with a hard G, I understand, Manger? Okay.
    Mr. MANGER. Correct. Thank you.
