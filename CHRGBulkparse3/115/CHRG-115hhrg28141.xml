    <Statement>
    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH, A REPRESENTATIVEIN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA</opening>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Good morning. I call the meeting of the
Oversight Subcommittee to order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Today the subcommittee examines the concerns over federal 
oversights of labs working with dangerous viruses and bacteria 
for research needed to protect public health and national 
security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Griffith">The Federal Select Agent Program under the joint management 
of the CDC and the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Services was established by legislation enacted in 2002, 
shortly after the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax mailings. These 
events supported Congress to conclude that certain dangerous 
pathogens, such as anthrax, smallpox, and plagues called select 
agents and toxins required regulation of its possession, use, 
and transfer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Griffith">The program oversees 276 registered laboratories and almost 
4,000 individuals involved with vital research in the 
diagnostics, vaccines, and medical countermeasures that save 
lives, protect American agriculture, and help protect the 
safety and security of the American people. In 2016, the 
program conducted 181 inspections of registered laboratories, 
and was notified of 177 separate incidents involving potential 
exposures with 998 lab workers monitored but, fortunately, with 
no illnesses developed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Because of the importance of this work and its potential 
dangers, this subcommittee has convened hearings in recent 
years on safety lapses in federal high-containment 
laboratories: the anthrax incident at CDC that potentially 
exposed more than 80 CDC workers; a mistaken CDC shipment of 
deadly bird flu to a USDA lab; a U.S. Army lab's mistaken 
shipments of live anthrax samples for a decade to almost 200 
different locations in the United States and around the world; 
and the FDA's discovery of decades-old, undeclared, and 
unregistered smallpox vials in a storage room the FDA had been 
renting from NIH and was missed by annual NIH safety 
inspections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Griffith">The pattern has been: incident involving handling of select 
agents, news stories, committee hearings, outrage, reaction, 
and short-term reform. Wash, rinse, repeat. The question before 
the subcommittee this morning is how do we break this pattern 
and instill a systematic approach toward oversight of federal 
select agents that improves safety and enhances the public's 
confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Griffith">The GAO's latest report adds urgency to this question. The 
GAO found that the program did not fully meet all key elements 
of effective oversight. That is troubling. Select agents are 
dangerous materials, posing a severe threat to human and animal 
health. One would have assumed that the oversight program for 
select agents would meet at least some of the effective 
oversight elements found at other government oversight programs 
for dangerous research, such as work involving radioactive 
materials and nuclear weapons. That is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Griffith">For example, the GAO concluded that the program is not 
independent. Both CDC and APHIS, the joint managers of the 
program, have high-containment laboratories registered with the 
program. As a result, experts advise the GAO that the program 
cannot be entirely independent, as oversight of their own 
laboratories may represent a conflict of interest. One wonders 
whether or how this has impacted the program's oversight. Two 
years ago, the HHS Office of Inspector General reported to the 
committee was the CDC was the entity with the most referrals to 
the program--for program violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Griffith">The GAO also found that experts and laboratory 
representatives raised concerns that the program's reviews did 
not target the highest-risk activities, such as anthrax 
inactivation, in part because it has not formally assessed 
which activities pose the highest risk. Thus, lab 
representatives told the GAO that the program focused on 
inventory controls and conducted time-consuming reviews so that 
nicknames such as Rob matched with registered names such as 
Robert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Griffith">On the other hand, as the subcommittee learned at its 
hearing in September of 2016, the incomplete inactivation of 
select agents, particularly anthrax, was a recurring problem in 
recent high-profile lab incidents. Unfortunately, the program 
has not focused on the need for more specific reporting and 
investigation of incomplete inactivation of anthrax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Technical expertise is another concern. Even with the 
recent extra hires, workforce and training gaps remain. The GAO 
has also noted the program did not have joint strategic 
planning documents to guide its oversight. It is perplexing how 
the CDC and APHIS operated for nearly 15 years without a joint 
strategic plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Finally, the GAO reviewed effective oversight approaches in 
selected foreign countries and regulatory sectors. For example, 
in Great Britain, oversight of laboratories that work with 
pathogens is under an independent government agency focused on 
health and safety. Under this structure, the agency has direct 
access to a department head with control over defining its own 
budget and staffing need without organizational conflict of 
interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Griffith">The subcommittee will examine whether administrative 
responses are sufficient to help the program meet the key 
elements of effective oversight. However, it is also fair to 
ask whether Congress has a legislative role. This Program, at 
its inception, was created in a fragmented state, a marriage of 
two divisions from two sub-Cabinet agencies in different 
Cabinet departments. The program was created with a security 
emphasis of guards/guns/gates in response to terrorist attacks. 
Fifteen years later, does this regulatory model for bioresearch 
laboratories make the most sense with more concern about 
biosafety and the growing public health threat of emerging 
infectious diseases?</paragraph>

    <opening>Prepared statement of Hon. H. Morgan Griffith</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">And with that, I yield back and now recognize the ranking 
member of the subcommittee, Ms. DeGette of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">Today, the subcommittee examines the concerns over federal 
oversight of labs working with dangerous viruses and bacteria 
for research needed to protect public health and national 
security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">The Federal Select Agent Program (``Program'') under the 
joint management of the CDC and the USDA's Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service was established by legislation 
enacted in 2002, shortly after the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax 
mailings. These events spurred Congress to conclude that 
certain dangerous pathogens such as anthrax, smallpox and 
plague--called select agents and toxins--required regulation of 
its possession, use and transfer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">The Program oversees 276 registered laboratories and almost 
4,000 individuals involved with vital research into 
diagnostics, vaccines, and medical countermeasures that saves 
lives, protects American agriculture, and helps protect the 
safety and security of the American people. In 2016, the 
Program conducted 181 inspections of registered laboratories, 
and was notified of 177 separate incidents involving potential 
exposures with 998 lab workers monitored but fortunately with 
no illnesses developed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">Because of the importance of this work and its potential 
dangers, this Subcommittee has convened hearings in recent 
years on safety lapses in federal high-containment 
laboratories:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; the anthrax incident at CDC that potentially 
exposed more than 80 CDC workers;</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; a mistaken CDC shipment of deadly bird flu to a 
USDA lab;</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; a U.S. Army lab's mistaken shipments of live 
anthrax samples for a decade to almost 200 different locations 
in the U.S. and around the world; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; the FDA's discovery of decades-old, undeclared and 
unregistered smallpox vials in a storage room that FDA had been 
renting from NIH and was missed by annual NIH safety 
inspections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">The pattern has been: incident involving handling of select 
agents, news stories, committee hearing, outrage, reaction, and 
short-term reform. Wash, rinse, repeat. The question before the 
subcommittee this morning is how do we break this pattern, and 
instill a systematic approach toward oversight of federal 
select agents that improves safety and enhances public 
confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">The GAO's latest report adds urgency to this question. The 
GAO found that the Program did not fully meet all key elements 
of effective oversight. That is troubling. Select agents are 
dangerous materials, posing a severe threat to human or animal 
health. One would have assumed that the oversight program for 
select agents would meet at least some of the effective 
oversight elements found at other government oversight programs 
for dangerous research, such as work involving radioactive 
materials and nuclear weapons. That is not the case. For 
example, the GAO concluded that the Program is not independent. 
Both CDC and APHIS, the joint managers of the Program, have 
high-containment laboratories registered with the Program. As a 
result, experts advised the GAO that the Program cannot be 
entirely independent as oversight of their own laboratories may 
represent a conflict of interest. One wonders whether or how 
this has impacted the Program's oversight. Two years ago, the 
HHS Office of Inspector General reported to the committee that 
the CDC was the entity with the most referrals for Program 
violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">The GAO also found that experts and laboratory 
representatives raised concerns that the Program's reviews did 
not target the highest-risk activities such as anthrax 
inactivation, in part because it has not formally assessed 
which activities pose the highest risk. Thus, lab 
representatives told the GAO that the Program focused on 
inventory controls and conducted time-consuming reviews so that 
nicknames such as ``Rob'' matched with registered names such as 
``Robert.'' On the other hand, as the subcommittee learned at 
its hearing in September 2016, the incomplete inactivation of 
select agents (particularly anthrax) was a recurring problem in 
recent high-profile lab incidents. Unfortunately, the Program 
had not focused on the need for more specific reporting and 
investigation of incomplete inactivation of anthrax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">Technical expertise is another concern. Even with recent 
extra hires, workforce and training gaps remain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">The GAO also noted the Program did not have joint strategic 
planning documents to guide its oversight. It is perplexing how 
the CDC and APHIS operated for nearly 15 years without a joint 
strategic plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">Finally, the GAO reviewed effective oversight approaches in 
selected foreign countries and regulatory sectors. For example, 
in Great Britain, oversight of laboratories that work with 
pathogens is under an independent government agency focused on 
health and safety. Under this structure, the agency has direct 
access to a department head, with control over defining its own 
budget and staffing needs without organizational conflict of 
interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Hon. H. Morgan Griffith">The subcommittee will examine whether administrative 
responses are sufficient to help the Program meet the key 
elements of effective oversight. However, it is also fair to 
ask whether Congress has a legislative role. This Program at 
its inception was created in a fragmented state--a marriage of 
two divisions from two subcabinet agencies in different Cabinet 
departments. The Program was created with a security emphasis 
of guards/guns/gates in response to terrorist attacks. Fifteen 
years later, does this regulatory model for bio-research 
laboratories make the most sense with more concern about 
biosafety and the growing public health threat of emerging 
infectious diseases?</paragraph>

    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DEGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. DIANA DEGETTE">    I welcome and thank our witnesses for appearing here today. 
I look forward to the testimony.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Well, I can't really agree with you more that we need to 
look at this. You talk about when these protocols were put into 
place 15 years ago. I was on this subcommittee 15 years ago 
when we started having these hearings. And we have had quite a 
number of these hearings. Over the years, I have had quite a 
number of visits to the CDC in Atlanta. I was regaling 
Democratic committee staff last night with my stories of when I 
went to the former CDC lab up in Fort Collins, which deals with 
vector-borne diseases and where they had these vector-borne 
diseases, aka West Nile, stored in modular units behind the 
building. And the units had grass growing up through the boards 
of the trailers and there were flies flying around in the 
trailers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. DeGette">I am pleased to say that the Congressman from that area at 
that time, Bob Schaffer, and I were able to secure funding for 
a beautiful new facility up there in Fort Collins and they do 
have the vector-borne agents stored appropriately now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. DeGette">But this just goes on and on and it is something that this 
subcommittee has to revisit over and over again. We have had so 
many near misses, as the chairman said, with pathogens like 
live anthrax, Ebola, most recently last November, the toxic 
form of ricin that was sent to a FEMA training center multiple 
times between 2011 and 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. DeGette">At some point, something very bad is going to happen unless 
the CDC acts. And if that means that Congress has to assist in 
streamlining and improving the way that we handle these agents, 
then this committee and, I am sure--I see the chairman of the 
full committee here. I am sure the full committee would be 
eager to help because we can't just keep stumbling along like 
this from year to year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. DeGette">The Select Agent Program has the vital task of ensuring 
that critical biodefense research proceeds without any danger 
to the health and safety of American citizens. And the Centers 
of Disease Control and the Animal and Plant Inspection Service, 
which jointly oversee the program, have to make sure that there 
is adequate oversight. But as the chairman just said, we are 
left today with the question of whether oversight of the Select 
Agent Program by both of these agencies is sufficient to 
guarantee that, on a consistent and long-term level, these 
high-containment labs are safely managing pathogens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. DeGette">We have to remind ourselves that these pathogens have to be 
handled every time with utmost safety and security. We don't 
have room for error. We don't have room for accidental shipment 
of ricin here, hither, and yon. If these pathogens fall into 
the wrong hands or if infection occurs in the general public, 
it literally will be very difficult to put that genie back in 
the bottle. And so any amount of uncertainty in this area is 
just unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. DeGette">I am glad that the GAO is here again today to discuss the 
most recent report on the Select Agent Program's oversight of 
dangerous pathogens. Like all of us, I am concerned about some 
of the findings of this report, particularly GAO's observation 
that the Select Agent Program may still not be applying the 
most effective approach to oversight at the laboratories that 
handle these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. DeGette">For example, GAO concluded in the report, ``The Program's 
reviews may not target the highest-risk activities, in part, 
because it has not formally assessed which activities pose the 
highest risk.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. DeGette">According to the report, the Select Agent Program 
inspectors may focus on concerns at laboratories, such as 
measures to deter theft, to the exclusion of biosafety concerns 
like how to handle or transfer pathogens. Both safety and 
security are essential concerns and both of these things are 
things that we have to work on together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Now, I also want assurances that certain components of the 
CDC and APHIS are adequately staffed to oversee the Select 
Agent Program. For example, according to the GAO report, there 
has been a shortage of inspectors which has delayed the 
issuance of a number of post-inspection reports. If that is 
true, then some laboratories are allowing poor practices to 
continue for a longer period than necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. DeGette">There are a number of other issues that are identified in 
the GAO's report that I am eager to hear the agency's response 
to. And in conclusion, I am pleased that they have continued 
their report on behalf of this committee to examine safety and 
oversight issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. DeGette">I am looking forward to hearing from everybody so that we 
don't have to come back here again next year or the year after, 
so that our constituents can rest easy and take this off of 
their ever-growing list of things that keep them up at night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    And with that, I yield back.

    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREG WALDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. GREG WALDEN">    I now recognize the chairman of the full committee, Mr. 
Walden of Oregon.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Walden</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Walden">Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman, for holding this
hearing on a really important issue involving how we can 
improve federal oversight of high-containment laboratories 
working with dangerous pathogens such as anthrax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Walden">Our Federal Government needs to conduct critical research 
on diagnostic tests or vaccines to protect us from diseases, 
while safeguarding national security against bioterrorism. 
These are twin goals that are very important. To ensure the 
safety of lab scientists and the public, while also building 
confidence and support for this research, oversight of federal 
select agents is a matter that we need to make sure that we all 
get right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Walden">In recent years, this subcommittee has held hearings on 
several safety lapses at federal labs that potentially exposed 
federal personnel and other individuals to hazardous biological 
agents. While the executive branch has taken several steps to 
improve lab safety since these lapses were first detected, the 
GAO's report on the Federal Select Agents Program oversight of 
dangerous pathogens shows that there are fundamental problems 
that have not been addressed by reactive short-term responses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Walden">After nearly 15 years of existence, the program does not 
meet key elements of effective oversight and the co-managers of 
the program, the Centers for Disease Control and the USDA's 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, lack a joint 
strategic document. The GAO's past work has found that such 
strategic planning is an essential tool to help agencies align 
their workforces with their missions and develop long-term 
strategies for recruiting, training, and retaining staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Walden">The GAO's report also provides potential solutions for 
improving select agent oversight. The Government Accountability 
Office reviewed alternative effective oversight approaches from 
the selected foreign countries. For example in Great Britain, 
oversight of the labs that work with pathogens is under an 
independent government agency. Both Great Britain and Canada 
focus their oversight on biological safety, as opposed to the 
emphasis on biosecurity in the Federal Select Agent Program. 
Other regulatory sectors, such as the regulation of nuclear 
reactors, also offer potential solutions for improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Walden">Finally, the GAO findings also suggest that it may be time 
for Congress to reexamine the structure and operations of the 
Federal Select Agent Program. Currently, the program is run by 
two different sub-Cabinet agencies from two different 
departments. Both agencies have high-containment labs 
registered with the Select Agent Program, an organizational 
conflict of interest because the overseers are not structurally 
distinct and separate from all the labs they oversee. So to 
address these concerns, the subcommittee needs to consider 
whether a legislative restructuring of the program is in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Walden">This program was also created in the immediate aftermath of 
9/11 and those attacks and the attacks through anthrax 
mailings, with an understandable emphasis on biosecurity and 
close scrutiny of those who possess and transfer select agents 
and how the agents are secured. I was here when all that 
happened and, in fact, excluded from my own office because the 
anthrax had made its way into the Longworth Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Walden">However, nearly 15 years later, incidents at the high-
containment labs have shown that primary risk lies with 
maintaining safety in the handling of these dangerous 
pathogens. And at a time of increased risk of emerging 
infectious diseases and the advent of gene editing, does an 
overhaul of the Federal Select Agent Program require 
legislation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Walden">That is why we are here today, is to learn more from those 
of you involved. And I certainly appreciate the great work of 
the GAO so I want to thank you all for your participation and 
look forward to working in a bipartisan way to improve the 
Federal Select Agent Program.</paragraph>

 STATEMENTS OF MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY, ACTING DIRECTOR, HEALTH

   DIVISION OF SELECT AGENTS AND TOXINS, CENTERS FOR DISEASE</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">CONTROL AND PREVENTION; AND DR. FREEDA ISAAC, DIRECTOR, 
  AGRICULTURE SELECT AGENT SERVICES, ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Good morning, Vice Chairman Griffith, 
Ranking Member DeGette, and other subcommittee members. Thank 
you for the opportunity to testify today on the federal 
oversight of the Select Agent Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">GAO has, for many years, identified challenges and 
recommended ways for improving the oversight of high-
containment labs. These labs work with the most dangerous 
pathogens, such as the Ebola virus, requiring the highest 
safeguards. Agencies have made progress implementing our 
recommendation. However, my main point today is that oversight 
of these pathogens is not as strong as it should be, 
potentially allowing for grave consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">In our most recent review, we found that the Federal Select 
Agent Program does not meet criteria for effective oversight. 
These criteria have been used to assess oversight of other 
areas with low probability adverse events that can have 
significant consequences. An example of such an event is the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">Of the five criteria, I would like to highlight two this 
morning: independence and the ability to perform reviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">First, according to our criteria, the organization 
conducting oversight should be structurally distinct and 
separate from the entities it oversees. The Select Agent 
Program is not. Both CDC and APHIS have labs registered with 
the program. CDC and APHIS have taken steps to reduce conflicts 
of interest. For example, in 2012, the agencies developed an 
MOU under which APHIS leads inspections of CDC labs. However, 
there was no reciprocal agreement for CDC to lead inspections 
of APHIS labs until 3 years later and we found that the 
agreement was not always followed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">Second, according to our criteria, the organization 
conducting oversight should have the ability to perform 
reviews. The Select Agent Program performs several types of 
reviews, including inspections. There is concern, however, that 
inspections do not target the highest risk activities. The 
program, in its current form, was borne from the horrific 
incidents of 9/11. Therefore, it is focused on security and 
inspectors spend considerable time assessing compliance with 
inventory controls and reviewing records. While this can be 
helpful to know what is stored in the lab, it does little to 
reduce the risk of theft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">Very small amounts of material can be removed from vials 
and replicated without being detected. Moreover, recent high-
profile incidents have been related to biosafety rather than 
security and no thefts have been reported in well over a 
decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">It's interesting to note that other countries and 
regulatory sectors we reviewed approach oversight differently. 
For example in Great Britain, an independent government agency 
oversees labs and they apply a risk-based approach to 
inspections, targeting those with a history of performance 
issues or those conducting higher risk activities. They also 
focus on biosafety rather than biosecurity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">Besides not meeting the criteria, the program also does not 
have joint planning documents to guide its oversight efforts. 
Notably, it does not have a joint workforce plan to help it 
manage workforce challenges that we found. For example, CDC and 
APHIS have faced challenges hiring and retaining sufficient 
staff with the necessary expertise. Inspectors have a large 
workload and intensive travel schedule that has led to delays 
in issuing inspection reports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">In 2016, CDC took up to 224 days to issue some of its 
inspection reports, far exceeding the program's 30-day target 
and delaying fixes to any identified problems. Workload issues 
have also sometimes resulted in staff from APHIS being assigned 
responsibilities outside their area of expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">In conclusion, CDC and APHIS share a critical role ensuring 
that important work with select agents can be conducted in a 
safe and secure manner. The bottom line is that oversight needs 
to be strengthened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY">Moving forward, the Federal Select Agent Program needs to 
take several steps, including assessing the potential risks 
posed by placing the program within APHIS and CDC, identifying 
and aligning efforts with activities that carry the highest 
risks, and developing a joint workforce plan. As these steps 
are taken, consideration could also be given to alternate 
oversight approaches.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF SAMUEL EDWIN</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="SAMUEL EDWIN">    I now recognize Dr. Edwin for a 5-minute opening statement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member DeGette,
and members of the subcommittee. I am Dr. Sam Edwin, Director 
of the Division of Select Agent and Toxins, which resides 
within the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response at 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I, along with 
my counterpart, Dr. Freeda Isaac, direct the Federal Select 
Agent Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Edwin">I have held this position for just over 1 year and welcome 
this opportunity to testify before you. I appreciate the 
subcommittee's continued interest in improving oversight of 
laboratories that work with select agents and toxins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Laboratory research on select agents and toxins plays a 
critical role in saving lives and protecting Americans. It is 
also an important part of our nation's contribution to support 
preparedness and defense against naturally-occurring diseases 
and potential bioterrorism events. Maximizing safety and 
security through our oversight is a complex and unending 
endeavor, not something that can be checked off a list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Edwin">I would like to acknowledge the important contributions 
that GAO's continued engagement and recommendations have made 
in our work to improve the program. We accept and will 
implement each of the five recommendations for CDC in the 
current GAO report. This morning, I will highlight actions that 
we have already taken in several of the areas addressed in the 
report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Edwin">First, our program has taken a number of steps to identify 
highest risk activities conducted at the registered 
laboratories and ensure that these activities are targeted 
during inspections. We determined risk based on the type of 
work being done by a particular entity and modify the frequency 
and focus of the inspections based on the findings at each 
inspection. When our program identifies what appears to be a 
commonly used processes that present a high risk, we target 
inspection to reduce that risk across all of the registered 
entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Edwin">We are in the process of transitioning to a new electronic 
information system which will provide real-time access to each 
registered entity's key program information and documents. 
After it is fully implemented, we will have the ability to 
monitor and analyze the data in real-time to identify potential 
risks, improve the inspection process, and continually enhance 
overall biosafety and security oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Second, in the area of enforcement authority, we are taking 
steps to assess risk from violations at individual facilities, 
as well as identify and address recurring violations. We 
recently finalized an effort to evaluate categories of 
noncompliance with select agent regulations, group them 
according to the level of severity, and enforcement options. We 
used this information to ensure consistency between 
inspections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Third, regarding the technical expertise, our program has 
inspectors who have the necessary practical experience and 
advanced professional degrees. That said, continued training of 
inspection staff is a key priority that we continually refine 
to address training needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Edwin">In addition, we are in the early stages of developing a 
joint strategic plan for the Federal Select Agent Program. This 
includes assessment of workforce and training needs for staff 
across the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Fourth, we have taken a number of steps to increase 
transparency and collaboration with the regulated community, 
including developing a process where we respond to requests for 
clarification regarding the select agent regulations. We also 
share draft policies and guidance documents for their input 
prior to finalizing, and we also implemented a process for 
dispute of inspection findings, and analyzing and reporting of 
the aggregate program data annually. The most recent report was 
just published last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Edwin">We are committed to further strengthening oversight of 
laboratories that handle select agents and toxins and 
appreciate the involvement of GAO and others that have provided 
recommendations toward that end. We value of the subcommittee's 
input as we continue to improve our oversight and enhance the 
safety and security of this work.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF DR. FREEDA ISAAC</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">I now recognize Dr. Isaac for a 5-minute opening statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">Dr. Isaac. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I 
appreciate the opportunity to testify at today's important 
hearing. I am Dr. Freeda Isaac. I am the Director of USDA 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Agriculture Select 
Agent Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">AGSAS, along with our counterparts at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention oversee the Federal Select Agent 
Program. Together, our two agencies oversee the possession, 
use, and transfer of biological select agents and toxins. These 
select agents and toxins have the potential to pose a severe 
threat to public, animal, or plant health, or to animal and 
plant products. I can assure you that this is a mission we take 
very seriously. Our goal is the same as yours. We want to have 
a program that allows our nation's scientists and researchers 
to safely and securely conduct important work and development 
with select agents and toxins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">Over the last few years, we have worked hard to strengthen 
our oversight of this program. Aside from our own efforts, we 
have received recommendations from outside experts, such as 
from GAO and the Federal experts Security Advisory Panel. We 
take these recommendations very seriously and we have used them 
to improve oversight of our program. I can confidently say that 
biosecurity and biosafety are stronger today than they were 
when I started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">I do appreciate this latest GAO report on our select agent 
program. We cooperated fully with the audit, and agree with its 
recommendations, and we have already taken steps towards 
implementing them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">We agree with the report that the independence of the 
Select Agent Program is important and that we must minimize 
potential conflicts of interest. We had taken steps in the past 
to reduce potential conflicts of interest. Notably, APHIS 
inspects CDC laboratories that use select agents and toxins and 
CDC inspects ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">We also agree with the recommendation to develop a plan to 
identify the types of laboratory activities that pose the most 
safety and security risks and to align inspection and 
assessment activities in line with those risks. However, I will 
note that our current inspection process does include some 
efforts to evaluate and analyze risk. For example, we analyze 
safety and security risks based upon the type of laboratory and 
agents it works with and we changed the frequency of 
inspections, based upon a facility's compliance history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">Another recommendation urges us to improve transparency 
with the regulated community. This has been a priority for us. 
We want these labs to clearly know what is expected of them and 
to understand how to properly secure select agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">We helped establish an independent forum to foster industry 
collaboration. We have set up new processes that allow 
stakeholders to review and provide input on program documents 
and policies. This extra communication and transparency helps 
them to understand their role and helps create a culture of 
safety in these facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="DR. FREEDA ISAAC">APHIS and CDC are committed to having the strongest 
possible Select Agent Program. We take these GAO 
recommendations seriously and we will use them, as we have all 
those previous reviews, to make this program stronger.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Dr. Isaac ">This concludes my testimony. I would be happy to answer any 
questions you or the members of the subcommittee may have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Dr. Isaac ">    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Thank you very much and I will now recognize
myself for 5 minutes to start the committee questioning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Dr. Denigan-Macauley, GAO found that the Select Agent 
Program does not have a joint mission statement. Do CDC and 
APHIS have the same missions stating what the program seeks to 
achieve; yes or no?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Thank you. The Government Performance and
Results Act of 1993 requires agencies to develop strategic 
plans that include documents and planning tools, such as 
mission statements, strategic goals, and objectives and 
performance measures. Is that correct; yes, or no?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Thank you. Although not binding to the
Federal Select Agent Program, these requirements have been 
found by the GAO to serve as leading practices for individual 
programs. Is that also correct; yes or no?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Both CDC and APHIS have performance measures
for their activities and select programs. Isn't that correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Are their performance measures the same?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Is there any overlap of the performance
measures each agency uses?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Griffith">So CDC and APHIS are using different metrics
to measure their own performance in the Select Agent Program. 
Is that correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Griffith">How about collectivity? Does the Federal
Select Agent Program have performance measures to track its 
progress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Griffith"> Dr. Edwin, the GAO found that the Federal
Select Agent Program does not have a joint strategic plan. Is 
the program taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan; yes 
or no?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Griffith"> Good. Did the program take these steps before
the GAO raised the issue with CDC and APHIS?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> We have individual strategic plans but not a
joint one and we are working on a joint strategic plan.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Griffith"> But you didn't take that action before you
got the GAO report.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> That is correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Griffith">And I am glad you are following some of those
suggestions and both agencies have agreed that the suggestions 
make sense. So I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Would such a step, including hiring an outside contractor 
to develop the joint strategic plan--would such a step include 
hiring an outside contract to help to develop the joint 
strategic plan; yes or no?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Griffith"> And has such an outside contractor been hired
yet?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Griffith"> Good. Has the outside contractor prepared a
joint strategic plan?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> He is working towards preparing that, been in
place for a month or so.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Griffith"> OK but we don't have a plan yet. When do you
expect one?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> We are having, actually, meetings with the
leadership, and the staff, and their coordinator. And they are 
in the process of developing one, probably within the next few 
weeks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Griffith"> OK, will you let the committee know when that
has happened?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    To avoid a conflict of interest with inspecting CDC labs, 
the CDC signed a memorandum of understanding with APHIS in 2012 
so that APHIS would take the lead on select agent inspections 
of CDC labs. Isn't that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> That is correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Griffith"> And so for most of the decade, the CDC was
inspecting its own labs. Is that correct, 2003 to 2012?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Griffith"> OK. And isn't it true that the CDC signed a
memorandum of understanding to avoid the conflict after the 
press and this committee raised concerns about CDC inspecting 
itself?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> That is correct. After receiving guidance, we
have taken that step.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Griffith">OK, I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Dr. Isaac, APHIS signed an MOU with CDC in 2012 so that 
APHIS would take the lead on select agent inspections of CDC 
labs, however, it was not until 2015 that you all signed a 
reciprocal MOU with CDC so that CDC would take the lead on 
select agent inspections of your labs. Isn't that correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Dr. Isaac. Yes, that is correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Thank you. At the briefing with the committee
staff last week, you could not explain the 3-year delay on the 
MOU for the APHIS lab inspections. Isn't that correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Dr. Isaac. That is correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Griffith">And now that you have had time to research it
and think about it, are you in a position today to explain the 
3-year delay?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Dr. Isaac. Yes. At that time, after discussing it with my 
staff, we did have some concerns regarding the authority of CDC 
to oversee some of the APHIS laboratories because those 
laboratories contained USDA-only agents and the CDC 
laboratories that APHIS takes the lead on have either overlap 
or USDA-only agents. So the authority is clear that APHIS has 
that authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    After we discussed that, I think the reason that we have 
changed the MOU is that administratively, consulting with our 
counsel, we determined that we could administratively have CDC 
oversee the inspections and sign the reports, as long it is 
done jointly with APHIS.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Griffith">OK and so I have only got a few seconds left
and I appreciated your statement that things are safer now that 
you are there. I appreciate that. I think that is right. We 
want to get it even better but I do find it curious that we had 
an MOU in place for over a decade with one of the agencies and 
your legal staff took about 10 years to come up with the 
opinion you now have. Oh, 3 years. OK, excuse me, 3 years to 
come up with the plan you now have. They seemed to have drug 
their feet a little bit with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    I have to yield back and now recognize the ranking member, 
Ms. DeGette, for 5 minutes of questioning.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Dr. Denigan-Macauley, the laboratories we are talking about 
hold high-risk biological agents. If improperly handled, these 
could result in serious or lethal infection of lab workers or 
even the general public. Is that correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. DeGette">And in other words, if we don't operate these
programs with precision, with pretty much zero room for error, 
theoretically, we could have risk to both public health and 
national security. Is that correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes, it is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Now in your most recent audit, you found there
were still problems with the Select Agent Program. In 
particular, you found that the program may not be sufficiently 
independent from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
and the U.S. Department of Agriculture that it may not have 
enough inspectors and the inspectors it does have may not be 
targeting the most high-risk activities when they examine 
laboratories. Is that an accurate summary of your conclusions?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes, it is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. DeGette">And as you heard in my opening statement, I
have been on this committee a long time, this is not the first 
time we have had these hearings. What do you think are the 
primary or root cause reasons we keep seeing this happen over 
and over again with respect to this program?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes, thank you for the question. 
There will never be zero risk, unfortunately. There will always 
be some risk that has to be taken but we do believe strongly 
that the oversight needs to be strengthened to prevent these 
safety lapses from happening. And we do also believe, as our 
report states, that they really need to look at the highest 
risk activities and make that formal determination. While some 
steps have been taken, it has not been a full formal assessment 
to best understand what those activities are.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. DeGette">And I know you made a number of
recommendations regarding the Federal Select Agent Program. The 
CDC and USDA have taken steps to implement the recommendations 
but your report shows that there is still work to be done. So 
my question is, Can you prioritize the recommendations that you 
have made? Which ones are the highest priority to make this a 
safer program with the greatest expediency and why?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Generally, GAO does not prioritize 
our recommendations. However, today I highlighted two that we 
feel very strongly about. The fact that they are not 
independent, that both entities are inspecting their own labs, 
they have to have inspectors there, according to the agencies 
because of the necessary expertise. So we definitely raised 
that as a concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    And we also raised the concern about not knowing what the 
highest risk activities are.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. DeGette"> Dr. Ewin, what is your agency's response to
those two particular issues?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> So we are actually looking at risk. Our
assessment of risk----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. DeGette"> Well, number one, about having independent
inspectors. What is your agency's response to that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> So in order to do the inspections, we really do
need the expertise of the agents that we--you know the public 
health agents are agents that are involving animal and plant 
health. And we are structurally separate from the main CDC and 
we work closely, almost on a weekly basis, on compliance and 
other issues with the----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. DeGette">You don't think you can have independent
inspectors because of the level of--I don't understand your 
answer to my question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    Dr. Denigan-Macauley, the GAO, said number one, independent 
inspectors. And what you are saying is well, the inspectors 
have to have, obviously, the level of training. Does that mean 
you can't have independent inspectors?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Oh, I am not saying that at all.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. DeGette"> Then what are you saying? I have got 50
seconds left.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> I think you know our inspectors are
professionals, no matter if you are looking at CDC----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. DeGette"> All right, can you have independent
inspectors, as the GAO is requiring?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    Now, the second recommendation was that we focus on the 
most high-risk activities. Are you implementing that 
recommendation?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> We are focused and look at all the high-risk
activities, including the type of the agent.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. DeGette"> So are you implementing that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. DeGette"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. DeGette">What about you, Dr. Isaac, your agency? What
is your agency's response to her first highest priority, the 
independence issue?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Dr. Isaac. Yes, we already currently have two things in 
place, which is our reporting structure within APHIS, where the 
program reports directly to the APHIS administrator. We also 
have CDC inspect APHIS laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    We also are, as the recommendation is, we are pursuing an 
option to have an external review of our program to identify 
the risks of how we are structured and to develop options to be 
able to take care of that risk.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. DeGette">And quickly, with respect to her second most
important recommendation that we look at the most high-risk 
activities, is your agency also beginning to work on that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    Dr. Isaac. Yes, we are.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. DeGette">Thank you. That will work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Griffith">I thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    I now recognize the vice chairman of the full committee, 
Mr. Barton of Texas.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Barton">Thank you, Chairman and thank you and Ms.
DeGette for organizing and holding this hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Barton">We have kind of been here before. It looks like every 2 or 
3 years we get a GAO report and the subcommittee has a hearing 
and you all come and say the appropriate things. And then we 
wait another 2 or 3 years and we have another hearing. Maybe 
this time it is different. You know I can't speak for anybody 
else but I am ready to, if necessary, legislate to change the 
law and actually put in the statute some of the recommendations 
of the GAO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Barton">    My first question is just a generic question. In one of the 
footnotes it says that we think we have 276 laboratories in the 
United States that handle these toxins. Why do we need 276 
laboratories to handle, or study, or whatever something that is 
so dangerous? Does anybody want to answer that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Edwin">The number of laboratories that are registered
with the Select Agent Program have been decreasing but we, our 
authority doesn't dictate the number of laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    And when you talk about the laboratory, when we talk about 
the laboratory numbers, there are only a few laboratories that 
work with these highly pathogenic----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Barton"> Well 276 is more than a few.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Barton"> Do you dispute that number?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> No, I do not dispute the number but not all of
them work with all of the agents that we regulate. Some are 
just working with----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Barton"> Can anybody start one of these laboratories? Do
one of your agencies have to issue a license? I mean if Diana 
DeGette and I decided to quit Congress and go into business and 
create one of these laboratories----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. DeGette">A very highly unlike scenario.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Ms. DeGette">    Mr. Barton [continuing]. What would we have to do? Could we 
just start it up or do we have to go to CDC or the Ag 
Department?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> So depending on the agents that you are applying
to work with, there is an initial registration process that 
involves a very comprehensive----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Barton"> Registration with who?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> If you are working with agents of public health
concern, with CDC. And if it is a USDA agent----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Barton"> Can you reject the application?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> If the measures that are not in place to safely
and securely handle these agents, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Barton"> But if they appear to be willing to comply,
there is no limit on how many people can set up these 
laboratories, if they, on paper, agree to comply with your 
requirements. Is that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> So on paper and also the physical inspection of
the facilities to have all of these measures in place.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Barton"> Well, I guess to get to the bottom line, should
we put a limit on the number of these laboratories that handle 
these highly dangerous materials?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> I think that is a bigger question that involves
multiple parties in biodefense and the scientific community to 
make----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Barton">I don't have any frame of reference but it
would appear to me, when you see the potential danger and you 
see the way some of these agents have been accidently 
transported and handled, I would think it might be advisable to 
put some sort of a limit or to go in and really, really look at 
the existing facilities with the potential to literally close 
some of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Barton">    Because I was stunned. I thought we had maybe 10 or 15 and 
that they were all highly classified and under control with the 
Department of Defense or some really, really high security 
areas. And apparently, anybody that wants to, any 
pharmaceutical company, any agriculture company, if they are 
willing to put the money up and at least pay lip service, can 
set up one of these laboratories.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> When the program first started, I think the
number was close to 400. And because of all the requirements, 
the number has actually gradually been coming down.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Barton"> Do either of your agencies have the ability to
absolutely close one of these facilities? If you feel they are 
totally in noncompliance, can you shut it down permanently?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> We can suspend and revoke their registration to
work with select agents and toxins.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Barton"> You can suspend their registration?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Barton">OK. Last question and my time is about to
expire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Barton">And Ms. DeGette and I think Mr. Griffith both alluded to 
this. GAO says there needs to be independence. Why couldn't we 
just create a separate agency that all it does is inspect 
these, take both of your inspection groups and combine them to 
a totally independent group? What would be wrong with that 
idea?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Barton">    Dr. Isaac. So----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Barton">I might even let GAO answer that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Barton">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes, we offer many oversight 
alternative approaches. We review the program in its current 
form but that was one of the reasons our methodology included 
going out. For example, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is an 
independent and it was decided years ago that that needed to be 
made. And several laboratories in other countries such as Great 
Britain are in that----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Barton">So that is a feasible alternative?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Barton">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. It is a feasible alternative but not 
something that we looked at in detail to know the cost 
associated with that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Barton">Do either of you want to comment on that before
I yield back?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Barton">    Dr. Isaac. So if I could just offer a comment is that 
because of the extreme scientific technical nature of the work 
that we do, and part of our oversight is to understand the 
research and the type of work that is being done with these 
agents, and understanding the proper use of the agent, where we 
are situated within HHS and USDA, we are able to share 
resources within those departments for that technical 
expertise, as well as administrative and emergency response 
activities. We are able to tap into experts to implement 
regulations very quickly that require immediate implementation.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Barton">Well that begs the question an independent
agency could do the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Barton">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Griffith">I thank the gentleman for yielding back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Griffith">I would make a point of clarification. Dr. Denigan-
Macauley, we have been talking about 276 labs but so that 
people who may watch this now or later will know, 276 labs are 
actually entities and those entities may have multiple labs. So 
we could actually be talking about 1200 or more labs. Is that 
correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. That is correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Barton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Barton">I appreciate that. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Barton">    And now we will yield or recognize Mr. Tonko, the gentleman 
from New York, for 5 minutes of questioning.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tonko</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Five of GAO's eleven recommendations concern the need to 
improve the independence of the Federal Select Agent Program. 
As we know, the Federal Select Agent Program is not an 
independent agency but a program managed jointly by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention and an agency under the 
United States Department of Agriculture called the Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service or APHIS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Tonko">GAO's report states that while CDC and APHIS have taken 
steps to reduce conflicts of interest potentially posed by this 
structure, more can be done in this area. So, GAO, let's start 
with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Dr. Denigan-Macauley, can you please explain why GAO 
believes independence is important for an entity like the 
Federal Select Agent Program?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Sure. We have previously used these 
criteria to look at adverse events with low probability and can 
have high consequence. So for example, the foot and mouth 
disease outbreak that happened over in the United Kingdom was a 
very tragic event, a low probability that it would occur. The 
Fukushima Diiachi nuclear reactor incident in 2011 is another 
example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Tonko">    While much research is conducted in this country very 
safely and securely, the probability is horrific if something 
were to happen. So, therefore, the criteria fit. And we also 
vetted the criteria with numerous folks that are experts within 
this field.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tonko</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Thank you. I would like to learn more about what
CDC and APHIS have already done to enhance the independence of 
the Select Agent Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Tonko">    So, Dr. Edwin, what actions have you taken to reduce 
conflicts of interest between FSAP and CDC?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Edwin">So the Division of Select Agents and Toxins is
located in the Office of Public Health and Preparedness. And 
the reporting lines to the CDC chief is a separate thing for 
us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Edwin">And also, being in that particular office, they do not have 
any laboratories that we regulate. Being in that office, it 
helps us to pivot because the Emergency Operations is also 
under the same office. If there is a national incident, then we 
can immediately pivot and the entire structure is there to 
support such an activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    So I see that as a very huge advantage that we have and I 
have direct access to the CDC Director, if there is anything 
that I need to engage with her on.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tonko</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Tonko">OK, thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Tonko">And Dr. Isaac, the same question. What have you done to 
reduce conflicts of interest between FSAP and APHIS?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Dr. Isaac. Yes, operationally, the Agriculture Select Agent 
Program, we report directly to the APHIS administrator. We have 
a face-to-face briefing with the administrator every month, 
where we update him on the program activities and other 
incidents and enforcement issues that occur with all USDA 
laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Tonko">And even though under the administrator, there is other 
laboratories because of the chain of command of those 
laboratories is separate from our chain of command. So with 
that direct link, it highlights how important the program is to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Tonko">    The other aspect that we do is we utilize CDC as part of 
any concerns we have with USDA laboratories. They accompany us 
on those inspections and they will assist us in enforcement 
actions or they may actually take the enforcement action 
themselves.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tonko</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Tonko">OK and turning back to GAO, in terms of the
independence here, Dr. Denigan-Macauley, can you broadly 
discuss GAO's recommendations to increasing the independence of 
the Select Agent Program? And how would those ideas benefit the 
program?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Sure. Dr. Isaac is correct that they 
do report directly to their director. However, this was not on 
paper. It is not known if it was actually being done. So that 
is one of our recommendations is to ensure that this is 
documented formally that this is done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Tonko">    One of the concerns that we have about not being 
independent is that this is a small community and they are 
there on each other's inspections. They say that the expertise 
is needed. We understand that this is a very technical field, 
however, there are other options for, that we talk about in the 
report, reaching out. Other sectors have come up with other 
options such as advisory panels to be able to bring in that 
expertise so that they can focus on the regulations and the 
expertise can be brought in.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tonko</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Tonko">    I yield back, Mr. Chair.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    I now recognize Dr. Burgess of Texas for 5 minutes of 
questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burgess</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Burgess">Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thanks to our
witnesses for being here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Burgess">Dr. Denigan, if I could just continue on Mr. Tonko's line 
of questioning for a moment. So the independent inspectors 
would, of necessity, come from other laboratories or entities 
and people would cross-check each other?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Burgess">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. My apologies. Could you repeat the 
question?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burgess</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Burgess">Well, just where are the independent
inspectors, where are we to get them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Burgess">Ms. Denigan-Macauley. There are some advisory committees 
here, even in the United States, that could be expanded to 
provide that level of expertise. We are not prescriptive in how 
that expertise would be obtained. Rather, we ask them to look 
at approaches using other regulatory sectors and other 
countries to determine how they gather that expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Burgess">For example, some folks also put more emphasis on the 
actual labs to provide their own level of expertise and they 
require certification of the biosafety officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Burgess">    So there are many different approaches that are out there. 
This is not the only one.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burgess</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Burgess">It seems to me, and I don't know that I am
sure about this, but for it to truly be an independent 
inspector, it probably couldn't be within the agency itself. 
That is one part of HHS'--or one part of CDC inspect another 
part. Is that a concern?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Burgess">Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes, it is and that is something that 
we noted in our report because the budget still comes from CDC 
and it still comes from APHIS. And so the decisionmaking 
process is coming from the CDC and APHIS. And this is one small 
program, amongst all the other activities that they have to 
consider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Burgess">    So yes, our criteria is that they must be structurally 
independent and separate.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burgess</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Burgess">Thank you for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Burgess">Dr. Edwin, let me just ask you. It may be a little bit off 
topic but you talked in your written statement, on page 4, 
receiving reports of theft, loss, or release, and the bottom of 
the paragraph, notifying appropriate authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Burgess">I was not in Congress when the anthrax event happened. I 
came the subsequent year after that but I remember reading 
about it in the newspapers and how horrific it was because 
anthrax, the early symptoms, are the symptoms of common cold, 
flu. And the ER doctor, one of the ER doctors, of the story 
that is seared into my memory, the ER doctor had seen a lot of 
cases of flu that day and this was another case of flu, until 
it turned out to be something much, much worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Burgess">    So is there any method of notification, be on the lookout 
for, when--not for perhaps that situation but if you have got a 
breach, if someone finds that ricin has been shipped around the 
country, is there a dissemination of this knowledge to first 
responders and medical experts in emergency rooms so that 
perhaps the unusual symptoms they are seeing is something that 
must need to be considered?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Edwin">So this is one example where you know we have
pivoted to our emergency operations that was providing exactly 
that information and connecting them to not only the subject 
matter expertise within the CDC, and other departments but also 
that the public health officials, and stuff and exactly 
providing that information on those types of incidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Edwin">On small ones that occur that we have reported in this, we 
make sure that if they need assistance from one of our SMEs on 
the list on that particular potential exposure, we try to 
connect them. And they, in turn, make sure that a person is 
taken care of the way he should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    So because the local physicians that may be treating won't 
have that particular expertise, we make sure that we connect 
the SMEs with the treating physicians.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Burgess</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Burgess">At that time, in fact it was the Thanksgiving
holiday of that year, and I was in labor and delivery. And the 
emergency room brought up a pregnant woman who was 28 weeks and 
for all the world looked like she had viral gastroenteritis. So 
I did the normal treatment and was fixing to sign her out and 
release her and she said, ``Is it important that I tell you 
that my grandfather is a member of President Bush's Cabinet?'' 
And I thought for a minute and I thought it may be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Burgess">So in short order, I was able to call some people and get 
some idea about whether or not these GI symptoms could be 
related to the same concern that was going in the Nation's 
Capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Burgess">But it certainly brought home to me had she not mentioned 
that casual reference, I wouldn't have known to look. Now, as 
it turned out, it was unimportant. It didn't impact her 
clinical course but it could have is the point. And then I 
would have been just the same as that poor ER doctor that I 
read about who attended the unfortunate postal worker. He has 
got to live with that for the rest of his life that he missed 
that diagnosis. If there is anything we can do to help people 
come to the right conclusion more quickly, I think we should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Burgess">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Thank you very much, Dr. Burgess. That was
compelling testimony of why this is so important, all of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Griffith">With that, I recognize the gentlelady from Indiana, Ms. 
Brooks, for 5 minutes of questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Mrs. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks so much to 
our witnesses for sharing with us this important testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Going back, actually, to that time frame, I happened to be 
a U.S. Attorney in Southern District of Indiana during the 
anthrax attacks. And so government offices all across the 
country were, rightfully, really alarmed and concerned and, in 
fact, received often fake or hoax anthrax packets, including my 
own office at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Griffith">And Dr. Edwin, as I have learned in preparation for today, 
prior to your role with the Select Agent Program, you served 
from 2008 to 2016 as the responsible official and Biological 
Surety Officer for the Select Agent Program at the U.S. Army 
Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. And it was 
from that place in July of 2008 that a biodefense researcher 
from your institution, Bruce Ivins, died from an apparent 
suicide after learning that the FBI was going to file criminal 
charges against him for the 2001 anthrax attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Griffith">In August of 2008, the FBI and Department of Justice 
announced that Dr. Ivins was likely solely responsible for the 
five deaths and the injuries caused by the anthrax mailings but 
in May of 2011, a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, at 
the request of the FBI, reviewed the scientific work and 
concluded the FBI might have overstated the genetic analysis 
linking the mailed anthrax to a flax of anthrax kept by Ivins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    So my question, Dr. Edwin, is, on July 10th of 2008, when 
Dr. Ivins lost his security--he lost his security clearance, as 
I understand. And as you were the responsible official for the 
Select Agent Program at that time, were you aware of any 
concerns about Dr. Ivins prior to that date and why he lost his 
security clearance on that date?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Edwin">So, I was the alternate responsible official and
there was a military officer that was the responsible official 
at that time. And it was also just you know I started in 
January and this is the suitability assessments that the Army 
does. Every individual that accesses select agents in the 
containment labs have personnel reliability program. So that is 
a certifying official that Dr. Ivins was under decertified him 
from entering the laboratory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    Mrs. Brooks. Thank you. And I would like to talk a little 
bit about this issue because it involves insider threats in the 
information. Is there enough information sharing with the 
Select Agent Program about potential or actual insider threats?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Edwin">So we require insider threat awareness training
for all the entities and this is one place where agent 
accountability plays a very important role. You know we make 
sure that the agents that they have recorded and what they are 
working with. Not only does it help with the insider threat, it 
also gives safety priority, biosafety because we know where the 
agents are and the people inside the lab that are working are 
also aware where they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Mrs. Brooks. But what I am concerned about that is 
incredibly important I am concerned about the focus on the 
personnel that have access to these agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    And so have there been improvements made in reviewing the 
suitability of the personnel who are registered to work with 
the select agents? Is there baseline psychological testing? Are 
there two rules in the biocontainment suite? Are there 
reassessments of their security clearances?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Yes, all of those are true and continuous
monitoring is also in place for people that are working with 
the highest threat or tier 1 agents that we call it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Mrs. Brooks. And since I have learned that there are so 
many different places where these labs exist, is this 
happening? And are you all confident, including the GAO, with 
respect to the amount of oversight there is of what Dr. Edwin 
just stated is happening? Is this happening in all of the labs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Dr. Isaac. Yes, in 2012 we did publish a new regulation 
which required for all tier 1 pathogens, which are the highest 
risk pathogens, that every entity has a suitability program. 
And that is what is part of our inspection process, that we 
ensure that they have a robust review of their personnel 
suitability and take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Edwin">It is also a requirement in the regulations that if they 
remove access for any reason, that that is reported to the 
Federal Select Agent Program and that the reason for a person's 
removal is reported to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Mrs. Brooks. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Doctor?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes, thank you. In 2009, GAO reported 
that we did not have a single entity overseeing all of these 
labs. It is important to note today that what we are discussing 
is the Federal Select Agent Program. There are other pathogens, 
other diseases, viruses, bacteria, toxins that do not fall into 
the Select Agent Program, such as tuberculosis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Edwin">So I do not have confidence that we have a good 
understanding of this robust program being implemented in all 
of the labs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Edwin">Mrs. Brooks. Thank you. And thank you all for your work. It 
is critically important for the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    I yield.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Griffith">The gentlelady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    I now recognize Mr. Walberg of Michigan for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Walberg</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Walberg">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the panel
for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Walberg">According to GAO's report, both witness agencies have faced 
challenges in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of staff 
with appropriate expertise. The report outlined some of the 
negative consequences of insufficient staffing, including 
inability to meet deadlines and lack of expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Walberg">But Dr. Denigan-Macauley, could you explain in greater 
detail the downfalls your team saw as a result of these 
staffing challenges?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Walberg">Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Sure. I should mention, again, that 
these are very challenging jobs that do require a high level of 
expertise and, in general, the program is working to ensure 
that they have that level of expertise. However, we did find 
that not all folks had the same level of expertise and 
sometimes, because of staffing issues, we are pushed out of 
their area where they had that level of expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Walberg">    So these are real. On paper it looks like an FTE but these 
are real problems that put people in a difficult situation. And 
not having these labs, this program sufficient staffed is very 
challenging.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Walberg</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Walberg">I understand both the CDC and APHIS have taken
steps to hire more staff in the past few years and, 
specifically, have begun to fill vacancies at their respective 
agencies since this report was completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Walberg">    I see from the report that the CDC developed a formal 
workforce plan for its component of the program in 2016 and was 
working to fill those positions. Dr. Edwin, would you tell us a 
little more about the workforce plan, and the hiring that you 
have done since that plan was developed, and the full size of 
your program staff?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> So in the last 14 months, we filled 17
positions, including my position. And we also have started with 
Dr. Isaac and their staff, the Strategic Workforce Plan that 
includes both training and workforce of the entire Federal 
Select Agent Program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Walberg</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Walberg"> With regards to the number of FTEs, are all of
those individuals inspectors?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Edwin">We have 51 inspector positions and the others
are support staff that look at different security requirements 
and other associated tasks within the division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Edwin">So when I started with CDC they already had identified this 
deficiency and we were given the 16 some positions to fill, 
which we successfully filled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    And I also want to say that most of our inspectors have 
come from the laboratories, select agent laboratories, and over 
50 percent, about 65 percent or so have Ph.Ds. and the others 
have master's degrees. So you know we do have that intellectual 
capital in the inspectors.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Walberg</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Walberg"> So more specifically then, based upon that
with the academic qualifications they have, the experience they 
have, what steps is the agency taking to address workload 
issues?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Edwin">So you know with the addition of the inspectors,
the estimated amount of time for travel and inspections outside 
has decreased by about 20 percent. It used to be about 45 and 
with the estimate, with the current inspection staff, there is 
about 25 percent the last time I spoke to our operations chief, 
which was a couple days ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    And in addition, with the new information system that we 
are developing, it is capturing a lot of efficiencies and it is 
going to provide the time, additional time for inspectors to be 
able to expediently do the inspection reports and increase 
efficiency on the performance of our program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Walberg</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Walberg"> So going in a positive direction.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Walberg</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Walberg">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Walberg">Similarly, APHIS developed a 5-year business plan, which 
included a plan to hire additional staff. Dr. Isaac, would you 
tell us about the 5-year plan and the hiring you have done 
since the plan was developed and the full size of your program 
staff?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Walberg">Dr. Isaac. Yes. In 2015 we developed a 5-year plan, which 
highlighted, essentially, the goals of the program, and where 
we wanted to be, and the type of staffing that we would need to 
be able to fully meet all of our goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Walberg">    As a result of that, we were able to, and we are very 
thankful to Congress, we were able to get additional funds this 
year that allowed us to hire eight additional technical staff. 
So with that technical staff, we were able to create several 
new positions, including a science officer position that deals 
with a lot of the in-depth technical scientific questions, as 
well as a dedicated facility specialist who has expertise in 
that area, additional security specialist, training specialist, 
and policy analyst. And we are very grateful for that and we 
believe that that is going to help us fulfill and meet all of 
our goals for effective oversight.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Walberg</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Walberg"> Thank you. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Griffith">I thank the gentleman for yielding back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    I now recognize Mr. Carter of Georgia for 5 minutes of 
questioning.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Carter">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank each of you
for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Carter">Dr. Denigan-Macauley, just a second ago I believe that 
Representative Brooks asked you about the--or you made the 
comment about the pathogens that are covered under the Special 
Agent Program--the Select Agent Program. Who makes that 
decision on what is covered and what is not covered?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. So CDC and APHIS are probably better 
in a position to answer that. However, collectively, they 
review what goes in, I believe it is every 2 years or so. But 
it is a Board of folks that make that decision.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Carter">A Board of folks?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Experts in the field, APHIS and CDC 
collectively.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Carter"> Dr. Edwin, do you want to expand on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Are we talking about the review of the----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Carter"> No, I am talking about the Board that makes
that decision on what is in the Select Agent Program and what 
is not in it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> Oh, so the biennial review. We call that process
the biennial review.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Carter"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> It is a group of individuals from various
government agencies.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Carter"> I am sorry.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> It is a group of individuals from various
government agencies that look at this you know every 2 years 
and give us the guidance to make the changes that are 
necessary.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Carter"> OK. In your opinion, is there anything in there
that should be in there or anything that shouldn't be in there?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> So you know we look at this every 2 years.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Carter"> I understand you look at it but I am talking
about now, today.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> I think that there are some agents that probably
we need to relook at but we are approaching that with the 
committees.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Carter"> When is the next time it will be up?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> It will be in a year and a half.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Carter"> OK, Dr. Isaac----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Edwin"> We do a lot of preparation before we get to
that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Carter">All right. Anything that you think that
probably ought to be in there that is not?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Carter">Dr. Isaac. We published a regulation this year and we will 
start a review process on the select agent list. We did receive 
some recommendations from our scientists, scientific experts 
who assess the list of select agents and make recommendations 
for removal or addition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Carter">    And in this last published, we elected not to remove any 
agents based on some concerns regarding security and policy 
issues. So we will, this coming year, we will be doing that 
assessment again and working through not only our subject 
matter panel experts, scientific experts that we work with, but 
also interagency experts.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Carter">OK. Anything, Doctor, that you think?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. No, I think that the point the GAO 
has made in the past is that our oversight of pathogens in 
general, pathogens and toxins----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Carter">Right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Is not comprehensive.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Carter">OK.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. And that is not the same with other 
countries.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Carter"> All right, I want to go to something real quick
and that is the incident reporting forms. From what I 
understand, between 2003 and 2015 there is a little bit of 
controversy as to exactly how many incidents we had. I think it 
was reported we had 10 and then they identified 11 more. And 
then I believe that GAO made the recommendation that we improve 
the incident reporting forms. And I am just wondering, have we 
done that? How is that progressing? How are we doing?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Edwin">So we have made the changes. One of the
significant changes is now if there is an inactivation failure, 
at least it can be formally reported to the program, which was 
not part of that form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    It is just 2 weeks ago I was approved by the OMB and we 
have that in place.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Carter">So you have it in place and it is working now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Carter">Just out of curiosity, because there was a little bit of 
confusion as to how many incidents actually took place between 
that time frame between 2003 and 2015, it was either 10 or 21, 
which there is a big difference between those. You believe it 
was 21.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Carter">Since that time, how many have we had, do you have any 
idea? Since 2015, how many incidents have we had?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. GAO reported that we had 21 incidents 
of inactivation and it is the Form 3. We have not done work to 
understand how many more may have occurred since then.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Carter">Since that time you came up with the 21?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Carter">OK. OK, Dr. Denigan-Macauley, just last month I
believe you came out with a report about the way that other 
countries are doing this, going about this process. It seems to 
me like the one thing that we are lacking here in America is 
that we don't have a national strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Carter">Did we learn anything from other countries? I believe you 
looked at Great Britain and maybe Canada. Are they doing things 
that we need to be doing?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Carter">Ms. Denigan-Macauley. Yes, we did, actually. We looked at a 
variety of different countries and they have very different 
approaches that are outlined in our report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Carter">And for example, as I mentioned, Great Britain has a 
separate entity that oversees it. It is similar to an OSHA but 
with much more teeth and they oversee the safety and security 
of a variety of different fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Carter">    So yes, we do outline many options.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Carter">Are you going to make those recommendations
that we need to be following?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. We made the recommendation that these 
other oversight approaches should be taken into consideration 
as they move forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Carter">OK.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Ms. Denigan-Macauley. We did not make a specific 
recommendation on a specific change. That is the dialogue that 
we believe needs to happen now.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Carter</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Carter">OK. All right, thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Carter">    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Griffith">I thank the gentleman very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Ms. DeGette and I have agreed that I can ask a couple of 
oddball science questions. So if you all will bear with me, I 
am trying to educate myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    So you all have all of these pathogens--and I am asking 
both Dr. Isaac and Dr. Edwin--and I assume that many of them 
are live or living organisms. Is that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Edwin">That is correct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    Dr. Isaac. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Griffith">And when your inspectors are going in, are
they looking for any mutations or to make sure that there is no 
possibility of, for lack of a better term, I am going to say 
cross-pollination?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Griffith">And the reason for this is I have just read this 
fascinating read called Inheritors of the Earth by Chris 
Thomas, a British scientist, who is talking about all kinds of 
things. And in there, he talks about a plant that comes over 
from Sicily, creates a hybrid, which becomes a separate species 
in Great Britain. It took about 300 years. But then, once the 
railroads came to town, they have discovered it created another 
hybrid in York in a matter of just maybe a few decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    And so I am worried that we have got all these dangerous 
things. Are we making sure there are no mutations or that there 
isn't something else going on? Because, apparently, organisms, 
as complicated, these are all ragworts and groundsel species. 
Well, they are a lot more complicated than some of the 
microorganisms. Are we making sure? Is that part of the 
inspection, that we are making sure we don't have mutations or 
hybridization going on within our own labs?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Edwin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Edwin">So we have a process to capture what you are
describing, a strain within an organism and variants. You know 
there is that opportunity for them to--our database captures 
that information. And as we inspect and look at the 
inventories, we also pay attention to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Edwin">It is an ongoing process and we encourage, anytime that 
there are differences, to be able to get that. And some of them 
actually need approval if they are making an antibiotic-
resistant strain. So it needs to go through the Institutional 
Biosafety Committees that have experts locally at the entity 
and then the process comes here. And we have an expert panel of 
experts from various agencies. We call these sometimes and they 
provide us the guidance as well as we look at it internally as 
well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Edwin">    So we are paying attention to those, especially since 
science is evolving rapidly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Griffith">I appreciate that because the concern has a
little bit different look to it and all of a sudden, we have 
accidently created something even worse than the original.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Dr. Isaac, are you all doing similar things?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Griffith">Dr. Isaac. Yes, we are doing similar things. We require 
that individual strains be registered and that if there are 
variations within their research protocol as to the type of 
virus that they are working or creating, and the type of 
species, animal species that they are working with, that they 
also report that to us. And we review those research protocols.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    And that is the same for animal pathogens and plant 
pathogens.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Griffith">All right. With that, I yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Griffith">    Any additional questions, Ms. DeGette?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeGette</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Ms. DeGette"> No, thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Griffith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Griffith">All right. Well, that concludes this hearing.
It was, hopefully, not too painful but we do want to make sure 
we keep the American public protected and we appreciate the 
work of the GAO in helping us with that and your cooperation 
with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Griffith">In conclusion, I thank all of you. And the members who 
participated in today's hearing. I remind members they have 10 
business days to submit questions for the record and I ask that 
the witnesses all agree to respond promptly to the questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Griffith">And with that, this hearing is adjourned.</paragraph>
