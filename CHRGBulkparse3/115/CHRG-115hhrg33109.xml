    <info>ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE  </info>
    <info>    The Helsinki process, formally titled the Conference on Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe, traces its origin to the signing of the </info>
    <info>Helsinki Final Act in Finland on August 1, 1975, by the leaders of 33 </info>
    <info>European countries, the United States and Canada. As of January 1, </info>
    <info>1995, the Helsinki process was renamed the Organization for Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE. The membership of the OSCE has </info>
    <info>expanded to 56 participating States, reflecting the breakup of the </info>
    <info>Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.</info>
    <info>    The OSCE Secretariat is in Vienna, Austria, where weekly meetings </info>
    <info>of the participating States' permanent representatives are held. In </info>
    <info>addition, specialized seminars and meetings are convened in various </info>
    <info>locations. Periodic consultations are held among Senior Officials, </info>
    <info>Ministers and Heads of State or Government.</info>
    <info>    Although the OSCE continues to engage in standard setting in the </info>
    <info>fields of military security, economic and environmental cooperation, </info>
    <info>and human rights and humanitarian concerns, the Organization is </info>
    <info>primarily focused on initiatives designed to prevent, manage and </info>
    <info>resolve conflict within and among the participating States. The </info>
    <info>Organization deploys numerous missions and field activities located in </info>
    <info>Southeastern and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The </info>
    <info>website of the OSCE is: &amp;lt;www.osce.org&amp;gt;.</info>
    <info>ABOUT THE COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE</info>
    <info>    The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as </info>
    <info>the Helsinki Commission, is a U.S. Government agency created in 1976 to </info>
    <info>monitor and encourage compliance by the participating States with their </info>
    <info>OSCE commitments, with a particular emphasis on human rights.</info>
    <info>    The Commission consists of nine members from the United States </info>
    <info>Senate, nine members from the House of Representatives, and one member </info>
    <info>each from the Departments of State, Defense and Commerce. The positions </info>
    <info>of Chair and Co-Chair rotate between the Senate and House every two </info>
    <info>years, when a new Congress convenes. A professional staff assists the </info>
    <info>Commissioners in their work.</info>
    <info>    In fulfilling its mandate, the Commission gathers and disseminates </info>
    <info>relevant information to the U.S. Congress and the public by convening </info>
    <info>hearings, issuing reports that reflect the views of Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission and/or its staff, and providing details about the activities </info>
    <info>of the Helsinki process and developments in OSCE participating States.</info>
    <info>    The Commission also contributes to the formulation and execution of </info>
    <info>U.S. policy regarding the OSCE, including through Member and staff </info>
    <info>participation on U.S. Delegations to OSCE meetings. Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission have regular contact with parliamentarians, government </info>
    <info>officials, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and </info>
    <info>private individuals from participating States. The website of the </info>
    <info>Commission is: &amp;lt;www.csce.gov&amp;gt;.</info>

    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Good afternoon. On behalf of the chairman of the Helsinki </info>
    <info>Commission, Senator Roger Wicker, and our co-chairman, Congressman </info>
    <info>Chris Smith, welcome to this briefing on ``Beyond Tolerance: Faith in </info>
    <info>the Public Square.'' I'll be your moderator for today. My name is </info>
    <info>Nathaniel Hurd, and I'm a senior policy advisor at the Helsinki </info>
    <info>Commission.</info>
    <info>    This is a briefing on faith in the public square as a good in and </info>
    <info>of itself, as a public good, and as the fruit of religious freedom. </info>
    <info>Jewish communities have been part of the square of what is now the </info>
    <info>United States at least since the 1650s. This past Saturday, a man </info>
    <info>targeted and killed 11 of our Jewish brothers and sisters in the Tree </info>
    <info>of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Last night, on National </info>
    <info>Public Radio, the executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, </info>
    <info>David Shribman, remarked, ``I sometimes say that this is the only </info>
    <info>community I've ever lived in in which the people who aren't Jews </info>
    <info>actually pronounce the Yiddish words correctly.'' Such fraternity </info>
    <info>reflects one of the most important exhortations in American history.</info>
    <info>    On August 18th, 1790, George Washington visited the Touro Synagogue </info>
    <info>of Newport, Rhode Island. Later that day, he wrote a letter to the </info>
    <info>congregants entitled, ``To the Hebrew congregation in Newport, Rhode </info>
    <info>Island.'' He ended his letter with these words: ``May the children of </info>
    <info>the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and </info>
    <info>enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants; while everyone shall sit </info>
    <info>in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to </info>
    <info>make him afraid. May the father of all mercies scatter light and not </info>
    <info>darkness in our paths, and make us all in our several vocations useful </info>
    <info>here, and in his own due time and way everlastingly happy.'' Words that </info>
    <info>I hope will guide us as a country, including the local community of </info>
    <info>Pittsburgh, in the coming weeks and months.</info>
    <info>    I will now introduce our panelists in the order in which they will </info>
    <info>speak. Eric Treene, to my left, is special counsel for religious </info>
    <info>discrimination at the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights </info>
    <info>Division. He oversees the Civil Rights Division's religious </info>
    <info>discrimination enforcement, outreach, and policy efforts. Mr. Treene </info>
    <info>also coordinates outreach to religious communities and the department's </info>
    <info>outreach efforts to the Muslim, Arab, Sikh, and South Asian communities </info>
    <info>regarding post-9/11 discrimination and hate crimes. Before joining the </info>
    <info>Department of Justice in 2002, he was director of litigation at the </info>
    <info>Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, where he represented Christians, </info>
    <info>Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Native Americans in a wide range </info>
    <info>of discrimination cases. Mr. Treene received his Bachelor of Arts in </info>
    <info>political science from Amherst College and his law degree from Harvard </info>
    <info>Law School. He was a law clerk to Judge John Walker, Jr. of the United </info>
    <info>States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Mr. Treene is the </info>
    <info>author of a number of articles and a contributor to two books on </info>
    <info>constitutional law and civil rights.</info>
    <info>    Welcome.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. The Reverend Dr. Andrew Bennett is program director for </info>
    <info>Cardus Law. He is an ordained deacon in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic </info>
    <info>Church in the Eparchy, or diocese, of Toronto and eastern Canada. </info>
    <info>Father Deacon Andrew served as Canada's first Ambassador for Religious </info>
    <info>Freedom and head of the Office of Religious Freedom from 2013-2016. He </info>
    <info>simultaneously served as Canada's head of delegation to the </info>
    <info>International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, a 31-country body which </info>
    <info>leads international efforts in Holocaust education, research, and </info>
    <info>remembrance. Father Deacon Andrew holds degrees in history from McGill </info>
    <info>and Dalhousie Universities. He received his Ph.D. in politics from the </info>
    <info>University of Edinburgh. And on a personal note, he and I have actually </info>
    <info>known each other since 1997, when he was a precocious Ph.D. student and </info>
    <info>I was a study-abroad student and actually had hair. [Laughter.] So this </info>
    <info>is in many respects a continuation of the conversation that we were </info>
    <info>having even back then.</info>
    <info>    Welcome, Father Deacon.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Sophie van Bijsterveld joins us from the Netherlands to reflect </info>
    <info>on the subject in a Western European context. She graduated in law from </info>
    <info>the University of Utrecht and received a doctorate in law from Tilburg </info>
    <info>University. Since September 2014, she has been professor of religion, </info>
    <info>law, and society at Radboud University. Dr. van Bijsterveld has </info>
    <info>lectured and published extensively in the fields of international human </info>
    <info>rights protection, religious liberty, constitutional law, and hybrid </info>
    <info>governance. Her books include ``The Empty Throne: Democracy and the </info>
    <info>Rule of Law in Transition.'' Her latest book is ``State and Religion: </info>
    <info>Reassessing a Mutual Relationship.'' Since 2007, she has been a senator </info>
    <info>in the Dutch upper house of Parliament for the Christian Democratic </info>
    <info>Party. From 2008 to 2015, Dr. von Bijsterveld was a member of the board </info>
    <info>of the scientific institute for the Christian Democratic Party. She was </info>
    <info>also a founding editor of the Dutch Journal of Religion, Law and </info>
    <info>Policy. I should note that there's a 6-hour time difference between us </info>
    <info>and the Netherlands, so she's joining us at 8:30 at night. We're </info>
    <info>especially grateful that she's with us.</info>
    <info>    Senior Counsel Treene.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Well, thank you very much. Like Americans everywhere </info>
    <info>and people around the world, I am grieving today the horrific killing </info>
    <info>at the Tree of Life Synagogue. And my thoughts and prayers are with the </info>
    <info>victims and their families. And 11 killed, six injured. And the </info>
    <info>Department of Justice--the attorney general spoke about, quite </info>
    <info>forcefully, hatred and violence on the basis of religion could have no </info>
    <info>place in our society. And he said every American has the right to </info>
    <info>attend their house of worship in safety. We are saddened by this. We </info>
    <info>are also resolute to pursue this hate crime. And charges have been </info>
    <info>brought. We've been very active in religious hate crimes against all </info>
    <info>people.</info>
    <info>    Two weeks ago we had a man sentenced to 24 \1/2\ years in prison </info>
    <info>for--a Texas man--for arson in a mosque in Victoria, Texas. We've been </info>
    <info>very aggressive. And the attorney general has been quite forthright </info>
    <info>about the importance of prosecuting hate crimes as part of religious </info>
    <info>liberty.</info>
    <info>    Normally we think of religious liberty as the right of people as </info>
    <info>against the state. You're free from infringement by the state. But the </info>
    <info>attorney general, speaking to the Union of Orthodox Jewish </info>
    <info>Congregations of America back in June said religious freedom means not </info>
    <info>only freedom from government intrusion, but also freedom from violence. </info>
    <info>The first civil right is the right to be safe.</info>
    <info>    The idea that we have religious freedom is one of our greatest </info>
    <info>treasures in America. We speak of it as our first freedom. It's the </info>
    <info>first right listed in the Bill of Rights. It's foundational to the </info>
    <info>right of conscience and our other freedoms. But I think the attorney </info>
    <info>general is acknowledging that this right will mean very little if we </info>
    <info>don't have the right to be safe in our places of worship, to worship as </info>
    <info>we see fit, to walk down the street without fear of attack because of </info>
    <info>what we believe and how we express that. So we stand with the people of </info>
    <info>the Tree of Life Synagogue and all Americans.</info>
    <info>    Religious freedom is the first freedom, as I mentioned. Nathaniel </info>
    <info>mentioned the letter to the Touro Synagogue, which was a community of </info>
    <info>Jews developed there in the late 1600s to bring their faith, to do what </info>
    <info>many Christian sects were doing, to see in a new land a place where </info>
    <info>they could worship freely. President Washington in his letter--I want </info>
    <info>to use it as a framework of what I want to talk about--he said, ``It is </info>
    <info>now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it were the indulgence </info>
    <info>of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their </info>
    <info>inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United </info>
    <info>States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no </info>
    <info>assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should </info>
    <info>demean themselves as good citizens . . . ''</info>
    <info>    This letter was pivotal for two reasons. One, it was the nature of </info>
    <info>the right that it was inalienable, it was an inherent right. It wasn't </info>
    <info>a gift from the government to the people. It was something that the </info>
    <info>Jews of Newport, of the Baptists of Virginia, that they had as an </info>
    <info>inherent right. The second part is that it was a principle applied to </info>
    <info>everybody--to not only the Christian sects that were multiplying in the </info>
    <info>United States at the time, but people of all faiths. President Trump </info>
    <info>has followed other recent presidents in proclaiming January 16th as </info>
    <info>Religious Freedom Day. It's a day we celebrate at the national level </info>
    <info>and a kind of obscure event. It's the passage of the Virginia Statute </info>
    <info>of Religious Freedom.</info>
    <info>    Why is a state statute so important? One, it was penned by Thomas </info>
    <info>Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence. But it also is </info>
    <info>important because it lays out the framework in three ways for religious </info>
    <info>liberty in America, that President Washington also touched on in his </info>
    <info>letter to the Hebrew congregation in Newport. First, the preamble. He </info>
    <info>says, ``God has created the mind free.'' And therefore, any </info>
    <info>interference with freedom, and with conscience, is not only something </info>
    <info>that is, as he said, meanness and hypocrisy for the government to try </info>
    <info>to punish such things, but it is an affront to the natural order.</info>
    <info>    Second, Jefferson said in the Virginia statute that ``no man shall </info>
    <info>be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or </info>
    <info>ministry,'' nor ``suffer on account of his religious opinions or </info>
    <info>belief.'' So it has a duality to it. You can't be forced against your </info>
    <info>conscience to support a faith. That's what we are familiar with as the </info>
    <info>establishment clause of the Constitution. But also, you can't suffer on </info>
    <info>account of your opinion and belief under your conscience. And that's </info>
    <info>free exercise.</info>
    <info>    And Jefferson had a third section saying that we know we're just </info>
    <info>passing a statute, but if some future legislature were to take it away, </info>
    <info>they could. They have the right. But they would be wrong in doing so </info>
    <info>because this is an inherent right that no one should be taking away. </info>
    <info>And looking back on this, someone said, oh, wasn't this wonderful? </info>
    <info>Thomas Jefferson, you created freedom for the Christians of Virginia. </info>
    <info>And he said, no, no, this wasn't about Christians. And he specifically </info>
    <info>mentions Hindus, Muslims, and Jews as all enjoying the protection. So </info>
    <info>there are two key takeaways. One is religious liberty is a fundamental </info>
    <info>right, not a gift from the state. Second, the protection of conscience </info>
    <info>is at the very core of this right. And, third, that it applies to </info>
    <info>everybody.</info>
    <info>    Now, when you look out in the world, there are three different </info>
    <info>approaches to religious--this is very, very rough--but the way I see </info>
    <info>it, it breaks into sort of three categories. There's theocracy. It can </info>
    <info>be sort of rigid where, you know, religion controls everything. It can </info>
    <info>be the milder theocracy of Britain in the 1700s, where you could be </info>
    <info>punished for working on the Sabbath and you had to worship at certain </info>
    <info>times and so forth, sort of a milder theocracy. But that's a theocratic </info>
    <info>view. There's sort of a secularism that governments should ensure a </info>
    <info>secular public order. That's what you see in France, where laicite is a </info>
    <info>high value.</info>
    <info>    And then there's a third vision, which I think Jefferson was laying </info>
    <info>out, which is a pluralistic vision, where religion is something the </info>
    <info>government will stay out. It will not become overbearing in the </info>
    <info>religious sphere and endorse one religion at the expense of others. But </info>
    <info>at the same time, the government will create room for religion, will </info>
    <info>make space for religion to flourish. So in schools, you don't have the </info>
    <info>teacher leading the class in prayer, but on the other hand you protect </info>
    <info>students' rights to gather. And we brought a case in the Department of </info>
    <info>Justice where kids were not allowed to gather for prayers at lunchtime </info>
    <info>in a small group.</info>
    <info>    So this is sort of the model. We're trying to keep introductions </info>
    <info>brief, but I'll get into as we go along with your questions how we're </info>
    <info>implementing this through the civil rights laws that we enforce--the </info>
    <info>hate crime laws, but also the law to allow places of worship to build </info>
    <info>students' rights of religious expression, people's ability in the </info>
    <info>workplace to have their religion accommodated so they don't have to </info>
    <info>choose between their livelihood and their faith. With that, I look </info>
    <info>forward to what our other panelists have to say.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Father Deacon Andrew.</info>
    <info>    Rev. Bennett. Thank you very much. I'd like to focus my talk on the </info>
    <info>related rights of freedom of religion and conscience and view them from </info>
    <info>my perspective as Canada's first Ambassador for Religious Freedom </info>
    <info>between 2013 and 2016, and now as Director of Cardus Religious Freedom </info>
    <info>Institute, which seeks to educate and advocate for religious freedom </info>
    <info>and conscience rights. And I also understand these rights as a </info>
    <info>Catholic, and so view it through the lens of the Catholic tradition, </info>
    <info>rooted in incarnational anthropology.</info>
    <info>    We find in section two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and </info>
    <info>Freedoms embedded in the Constitutional Act of 1982 enumeration of </info>
    <info>fundamental freedoms, the equivalent of the inalienable rights of the </info>
    <info>American Bill of Rights. It's neither whimsy nor accidental that the </info>
    <info>first fundamental freedom is freedom of conscience and religion. We </info>
    <info>bind them together in the Canadian Charter. If we're to share a common </info>
    <info>life in Canada, or anywhere else for that matter, robust freedom of </info>
    <info>religion and conscience must be affirmed and upheld. It is the freedom </info>
    <info>that enables us to live fully as we are, and as we are called to do.</info>
    <info>    Freedom of religion bears witness to the truth that human beings </info>
    <info>desire to make sense of our world and to encounter the divine. Unlike </info>
    <info>the freedoms that relate to public action--such as freedom of </info>
    <info>expression, freedom of association, freedom of assembly--to which it is </info>
    <info>bound, freedom of conscience and religion addresses what Professor </info>
    <info>Rabbi David Novak of the University of Toronto has referred to as the </info>
    <info>``metaphysical need of the human person.'' In this sense, religious </info>
    <info>freedom can perhaps be more fully defined beyond international human </info>
    <info>rights covenants, beyond simply the Bill of Rights or the Canadian </info>
    <info>Charter of Rights as having the initial freedom to contemplate the </info>
    <info>metaphysical and--[audio break]--just who am I? Who am I in </info>
    <info>relationship to you? Who am I in relationship to the world in which I </info>
    <info>live? And who am I in relationship to God to a particular philosophy to </info>
    <info>which I elect to subscribe and follow?</info>
    <info>    Thought necessarily precedes action. In a religious way, freedom of </info>
    <info>conscience does not necessarily relate to theological or creedal </info>
    <info>statements, but rather to the inherent human freedom to believe and </info>
    <info>assert certain truths. For example, that medical-assisted suicide is </info>
    <info>wrong, a belief that is not necessarily dependent on confessing a </info>
    <info>particular religious faith. It can come from a humanistic view. The </info>
    <info>frequent and mistaken post-modern assumption gaining currency in </info>
    <info>certain quarters, including in Canada, is that freedom of religion or </info>
    <info>conscience can be relegated in favor of upholding a broader freedom of </info>
    <info>expression of association. To diminish the defense of religious freedom </info>
    <info>conscience rights this way, I would argue, is a symptom of an amnesia--</info>
    <info>an amnesia that is increasingly forgetful of who we are as human </info>
    <info>beings, forgetful of our deepest longings, and of our true dignity.</info>
    <info>    The ability to freely, publicly and privately act upon this </info>
    <info>metaphysical need that I talked about is foundational to our democracy </info>
    <info>and foundational to our common life together. Without the guarantee of </info>
    <info>this freedom, we are no less free in our interior life, but when </info>
    <info>freedom of conscience and religion is threatened or ignored, our public </info>
    <info>common living out of our lives of faith can be undermined, sometimes </info>
    <info>gravely. So in a truly pluralist democracy, acceptance of difference </info>
    <info>must include the right to hold different theological and different </info>
    <info>ethical and moral positions, even when they go against the prevailing </info>
    <info>spirit of our age. So long as these views are held and advanced </info>
    <info>peacefully and do not advocate physical violence that would violate </info>
    <info>human dignity, they must be allowed to inhabit the public space.</info>
    <info>    We must reject what I would label an ``illiberal totalitarianism'' </info>
    <info>in the public square that seeks to establish socially correct and </info>
    <info>acceptable beliefs, treating any peacefully contrary view as deviant </info>
    <info>and something to be silenced. There must be no totalitarianism of </info>
    <info>accepted belief or accepted opinion in a pluralistic democracy such as </info>
    <info>Canada or the United States. A true pluralism must embrace and enable </info>
    <info>difference, but not simply a subset of differences that may be </info>
    <info>permitted at a moment by a given set of beliefs at a given moment in </info>
    <info>our history. This, I would argue, is illiberal pluralism that embraces </info>
    <info>a cultish secularism where the state imposes values and dictates what </info>
    <info>religious beliefs are publicly permissible. The freedom to practice </info>
    <info>one's deeply held religious faith and hold positions of conscience in </info>
    <info>the public square is a freedom that implicitly advances and supports </info>
    <info>true pluralism.</info>
    <info>    To champion religious freedom, and also conscience rights, is to </info>
    <info>also implicitly accept that there are those in our common life who will </info>
    <info>hold beliefs, theological and philosophical and moral, that many of us </info>
    <info>will vehemently reject. And that's okay. If people in our society, </info>
    <info>whether they be Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, or Jews, or people of no </info>
    <info>religious faith, are constrained in their faith through practice and </info>
    <info>how that faith informs their conscience, and profoundly shapes their </info>
    <info>understanding of the human person, they will become increasingly </info>
    <info>marginalized and our society increasingly atomized.</info>
    <info>    In building our common life and maintaining the public square, we </info>
    <info>must champion human flourishing as the common good so that our fellow </info>
    <info>human beings may flourish and be able to live their lives of faith </info>
    <info>fully--both privately and publicly. Increasingly in Canada, there are </info>
    <info>growing and persistent challenges to the inherent freedom of conscience </info>
    <info>and religion. These challenges come from our secular institutions--</info>
    <info>legislative, administrative, and judicial--from the overstepping and </info>
    <info>infringing on Canadians' freedom in this regard. Again, a freedom that, </info>
    <info>as our first presenter noted, is not the gift of the state, but rather </info>
    <info>a freedom that we bear in virtue of being human beings.</info>
    <info>    So in conclusion, in recent years there have been encroachments by </info>
    <info>a self-proclaimed ``neutral secular order'' to advance a rival secular </info>
    <info>democracy, intolerant of genuine diversity. There have also been </info>
    <info>statutory and regulatory actions taken to constrain freedom of religion </info>
    <info>and conscience at both the federal and municipal levels. Some of the </info>
    <info>most notable cases include the 2018 Canada Summer Jobs Attestation, the </info>
    <info>2018 Supreme Court of Canada decisions in the Trinity Western Law </info>
    <info>School case, and the Wall case, the bubble zone legislation in Ontario, </info>
    <info>and the violation of conscience rights by the College of Physicians and </info>
    <info>Surgeons of Ontario. And I am happy to speak to some of these cases in </info>
    <info>greater detail in response to questions.</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Thank you, Father Deacon.</info>
    <info>    Dr. van Bijsterveld.</info>
    <info>    Dr. van Bijsterveld. Thank you very much. It is a great honor to </info>
    <info>participate in this meeting. And I thank the Helsinki Commission very </info>
    <info>much for inviting me.</info>
    <info>    My presentation focuses on Western European developments, and </info>
    <info>certainly religious freedom and the place of religion in the public </info>
    <info>square. And I will approach this topic first by outlining some </info>
    <info>characteristics of the debates and, second, I will sketch some public </info>
    <info>responses toward the current challenges. I will start with some </info>
    <info>preliminary remarks and I will close with a few personal observations.</info>
    <info>    Three preliminary remarks. The first: 57 countries, including the </info>
    <info>United States, Canada, and all the countries of Europe, are </info>
    <info>participating states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation </info>
    <info>in Europe (OSCE). The relations between state, society, and religion </info>
    <info>differ from country to country. This is also true for the part of this </info>
    <info>region that is formed by Western Europe. Over the centuries, different </info>
    <info>political realities, differences in religious makeup of the society, </info>
    <info>differences in interrelation between secular and ecclesiastical </info>
    <info>authorities and historical facts all have had an impact on what we now </info>
    <info>call the place of religion in the public square.</info>
    <info>    My second remark--in the OSCE context, the notions of ``respect'' </info>
    <info>and ``tolerance'' are often featured. However positive these notions </info>
    <info>appear, their meaning is not always clear or even defined. Where </info>
    <info>``respect'' is concerned, the distinction must be made, in my view, </info>
    <info>between persons on the one hand and views and actions on the other. The </info>
    <info>person deserves respect as a person. But views and actions, not </info>
    <info>necessarily so. And as of ``tolerance,'' I prefer to speak in terms of </info>
    <info>liberty and restrictions to liberty when possible. Either persons enjoy </info>
    <info>liberty or they do not, in which case there must be valid reasons to </info>
    <info>legitimize restrictions. Alternatively, one could speak in terms of </info>
    <info>equal treatment or non-discrimination.</info>
    <info>    My third remark--the word ``secularism'' often features in debates </info>
    <info>on religion in the public square. And this word can have different </info>
    <info>meanings as various authors also realize. In the words of the former </info>
    <info>Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, it can refer to </info>
    <info>``programmatic secularism'' or ``procedural secularism.'' In this </info>
    <info>realm, programmatic secularism stands for fending off manifestations of </info>
    <info>religion in the public square and procedural secularism is </info>
    <info>fundamentally open to manifestations of religion--the state, itself, </info>
    <info>being secular. In a given context, it's important the use of secularism </info>
    <info>is clear.</info>
    <info>    Now, for my preliminary remarks: I now come to the general </info>
    <info>characteristics of the debates. Three general characteristics mark the </info>
    <info>current debates. The first is the nature of the issues. In the roughly </info>
    <info>200 years of modern debates on religion in the public square and </info>
    <info>freedom of religion in Western European countries, various periods can </info>
    <info>be discerned. In previous periods, the focus was of institutional </info>
    <info>competences between church and state, or accommodation of religious </info>
    <info>social activities in the framework of the emerging welfare state. And </info>
    <info>current issues of contention mostly concern values--which values are </info>
    <info>being expressed or promoted through religion, and how much liberty do </info>
    <info>they deserve?</info>
    <info>    Second, there is a transnational dimension of many issues </info>
    <info>concerning religion. During the 20th century, religious issues were by </info>
    <info>and large purely domestic issues. Currently, these issues are often </info>
    <info>connected to controversial societal contexts as immigration, </info>
    <info>integration, foreign influencing, and radicalization. And as a result, </info>
    <info>the debates are often conducted in terms of limitations of liberty </info>
    <info>rather than liberty.</info>
    <info>    Third, over the last decades, religion has increasingly become </info>
    <info>experienced as a purely private matter, and religious liberty as an </info>
    <info>individual personal liberty. The current issues of controversy, </info>
    <info>however, have once again fostered an awareness of the societal and </info>
    <info>public dimensions of religion. This rediscovery also has positive </info>
    <info>sides. In many Western European countries, functional welfare states </info>
    <info>have felt overburdened and religion is retreating somewhat from the </info>
    <info>social domain, notably financially. And this goes hand-in-hand with the </info>
    <info>renewed positive valuation of the social functions of religious </info>
    <info>organizations. New forms of contact, and cooperation, and coordination </info>
    <info>between such organizations and, notably, local authorities take place.</info>
    <info>    I now come to my next point--public responses toward current </info>
    <info>challenges. And, again, I make three observations.</info>
    <info>    First, Americans scholars or academics observe a trend that legal </info>
    <info>issues concerning religion are seen through the lens of equal treatment </info>
    <info>rather than religious liberty. Insofar as individuals are concerned, </info>
    <info>this resonates with experiences in Western Europe for the same reasons </info>
    <info>as have been mentioned. And for institutional liberty basis, it is less </info>
    <info>self-evident.</info>
    <info>    Second, legal and political responses to religious diversification </info>
    <info>may rely on basic instincts of traditional church-state systems. Thus, </info>
    <info>France continues to bar visible signs of religion in the public sphere, </info>
    <info>whereas, for example, in Italy Catholicism may function as a symbolic </info>
    <info>focal point, the crucifix in the public classroom being an example. And </info>
    <info>other countries experience more of a dilemma.</info>
    <info>    Third, the European Court of Human Rights tends to leave national </info>
    <info>states some room for maneuver in finding a right balance with regard to </info>
    <info>these issues. Although the Court is sometimes criticized for this, one </info>
    <info>must realize--especially in the United States--that this is a </info>
    <info>supranational court that deals with countries with a variety of </info>
    <info>different starting points where the place of religion in the public </info>
    <info>domain is concerned. And there are many issues that are controversial </info>
    <info>in the various states as well.</info>
    <info>    Finally, a few personal observations. First, it is unavoidable that </info>
    <info>religious issues tend to be assessed through the lens of equality </info>
    <info>rather than liberty. However, the one should not replace the other. </info>
    <info>Furthermore, equal treatment applies in equal circumstances. And equal </info>
    <info>treatment therefore is not necessarily identical treatment. Second, </info>
    <info>restrictions to religious liberty may be necessary. However, applying </info>
    <info>general solutions to a specific problem must be avoided. Legislation, </info>
    <info>therefore, is not always the most fruitful response to an issue.</info>
    <info>    And third, and last, the development of a relaxed attitude of </info>
    <info>public authorities toward religion begins with a basic familiarity with </info>
    <info>concrete religious traditions and denominations. For both public </info>
    <info>authorities and religious communities, it is important to get to know </info>
    <info>each other, if they do not already. Thank you for your attention.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Thank you. We'll now have a period of sort of a moderated </info>
    <info>Q&amp;amp;A. So I'll be asking the panelists some questions. Once that's done, </info>
    <info>we'll open it up to questions from you who are here in the room, as </info>
    <info>well as those of you that are watching online on Facebook. For those of </info>
    <info>you in the room, if you could use the standing microphone and identify </info>
    <info>yourself when it's time for that Q&amp;amp;A period.</info>
    <info>    Just a note about the context of my questions: A lot of the debates </info>
    <info>and discussions about this topic often are mostly restricted to </info>
    <info>questions about law and public policy. And unfortunately, there aren't </info>
    <info>enough discussions about people's first principles, about their basic </info>
    <info>assumptions, about distinctions between different kind of categories </info>
    <info>and words, et cetera. So a lot of my questions are intended to tease </info>
    <info>that out of our panelists.</info>
    <info>    My first line of questions is going to focus on philosophy. I think </info>
    <info>philosophy can be one of those subjects that's easy to have a go at. </info>
    <info>Seems to be somewhat impractical. But the fact is that all of us have </info>
    <info>existential questions, metaphysical questions that tug on the human </info>
    <info>heart. And Father Deacon Andrew highlighted some of them.</info>
    <info>    Philosophy actually helps us to seek and receive answers to some of </info>
    <info>those questions. I think it's also worth noting that how we view the </info>
    <info>world, our ideas-in this modern, contemporary setting--are often not </info>
    <info>entirely new. They have roots in earlier times and in earlier ages. And </info>
    <info>philosophy can help us trace back those roots.</info>
    <info>    A lot of the discussions and debates about faith in the public </info>
    <info>square intersect with broader debates about the very nature of truth. </info>
    <info>Does truth exist? Is it objective? Does it exist outside of us? Is it </info>
    <info>something that we can know and access, or is it something that we at </info>
    <info>the individual level just sort of generate and create, or is it </info>
    <info>something that we can actually receive? What we're discussing now </info>
    <info>reflects in many respects philosophical shifts. In particular, from the </info>
    <info>Medieval period to the period of the Renaissance, and then forthgoing </info>
    <info>the period of the Enlightenment and its sort of philosophical </info>
    <info>successors. In particular, I'm thinking of Descartes.</info>
    <info>    And so my first set of questions are in particular for Father </info>
    <info>Deacon Andrew and Dr. van Bijsterveld. What is the philosophical </info>
    <info>lineage about some of the contemporary skepticism that we see about </info>
    <info>truth as something that's objective, as existing outside of us, as </info>
    <info>something that is accessible and knowable, evidenced in ordinary human </info>
    <info>experience, and received rather than self-created?</info>
    <info>    And then for Mr. Treene, if you could say a word or two about the </info>
    <info>philosophical lineage of faith in the public square and the religious </info>
    <info>freedom that enables it, that we can see in the founding documents in </info>
    <info>the United States? And then I'll ask you to go into a more provocative </info>
    <info>area, which is as you look at faith in the public square now, basic </info>
    <info>discussions about religious freedom, and reflect on our founding </info>
    <info>documents, do you think that there were any philosophical presumptions </info>
    <info>that the founders made, perhaps unintentionally, that have sort of led </info>
    <info>to some of the challenges that we see today?</info>
    <info>    We'll start with Father Deacon Andrew and Dr. van Bijsterveld.</info>
    <info>    Rev. Bennett. Well, thank you very much. That's certainly a very </info>
    <info>big question about, theological--[inaudible]--traditional </info>
    <info>understandings of truth as being objective and universal. Our </info>
    <info>understanding of fundamental freedoms--such as freedom of religion, </info>
    <info>freedom of conscience--certainly in Western democracies derives </info>
    <info>directly from the Judeo-Christian understanding of the human being, </info>
    <info>human person, and the human person's relationship to an existential </info>
    <info>reality, metaphysical reality, their relationship to God.</info>
    <info>    So this understanding of truth is definitely something that exists </info>
    <info>in and of itself. It is something that exists in and of itself, and it </info>
    <info>is beyond us in a certain sense, but also accessible by us because we </info>
    <info>believe that certainly as Christians, and as Jews, and some other </info>
    <info>faiths as well, that truth is revealed to us. So we have a particular </info>
    <info>understanding of revelation and that core understanding of revealed </info>
    <info>truth as objective and universal. Certainly from the Christian </info>
    <info>perspective, we understand that truth is not a particular philosophy or </info>
    <info>a particular abstraction but rather it's a person. It's the person of </info>
    <info>Jesus Christ. And so we have that understanding as Christians that </info>
    <info>truth is a person with whom you have a relationship. And you have a </info>
    <info>relationship with, and that grows as you enter more fully into that </info>
    <info>truth.</info>
    <info>    So that understanding of truth certainly is implicit within our </info>
    <info>understanding of fundamental freedoms, because there's this </info>
    <info>understanding that we have these freedoms by virtue of being human </info>
    <info>beings. And because we are human beings, created in the image and </info>
    <info>likeness of God, there is a certain dignity that we have. Now, it's </info>
    <info>important, I think, in these days to sort of unpack what we mean by </info>
    <info>human dignity, because human dignity now often has a very different </info>
    <info>meaning or is construed in different ways--as are other terms such as </info>
    <info>compassion and even truth itself. But from my perspective, that would </info>
    <info>be how I would respond to your question, Nathaniel.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. And Dr. van Bijsterveld?</info>
    <info>    Dr. van Bijsterveld. Yes. Thank you. Well, I find your basic first </info>
    <info>question quite hard to answer. What I could say is this: At a time when </info>
    <info>Western European countries' freedom of religion was first incorporated </info>
    <info>in the constitutions, we see that in a context of societies that are </info>
    <info>thoroughly Christian, whatever sort of divisions or predominance of a </info>
    <info>particular religion there may be. What we see, of course, now is that </info>
    <info>freedom of religion functions in a much more secularized context, and a </info>
    <info>context where diversity has gained a different meaning. And it's clear </info>
    <info>that those differences over time may also influence the interpretation </info>
    <info>of religious freedom, or at least can understand that there will be </info>
    <info>debate about what religious freedom actually means.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Yes. And to respond to something that Dr. van </info>
    <info>Bijsterveld said in her opening remarks, where she mentioned in U.S. </info>
    <info>law things have moved from religious liberty more toward equal </info>
    <info>treatment, I would say in some respects that I would agree with that. </info>
    <info>But both of these have roots with the founders. The founders, as I </info>
    <info>mentioned, looked at equal treatment of all persons regardless of </info>
    <info>religion, as well as this idea of conscience being precedent to the </info>
    <info>demands of the state. And if you look at the law, there have been a </info>
    <info>number of decisions that have moved the ball in religious liberty by </info>
    <info>using equal treatment paradigms. Most recently Trinity Lutheran, saying </info>
    <info>if you have a program giving playground equipment--here, it was </info>
    <info>actually the rubber surface so that the kids don't get injured on the </info>
    <info>playground--you had to treat churches equally. Same thing with the </info>
    <info>school choice decisions. If you give out a scholarship to parents you </info>
    <info>can't discriminate. Parents are able to use those at the school of </info>
    <info>their choice. Same thing in free speech cases. If there's a forum for </info>
    <info>speech, you can't exclude religious speech.</info>
    <info>    Now, the law has moved in that direction, but all of those have </info>
    <info>been five-four decisions, six-three decisions on our Supreme Court. I </info>
    <info>think it's worth nothing that if you look at the unanimous decisions in </info>
    <info>the religious liberty space, they've all been pure religious liberty </info>
    <info>cases. Most recently Hosanna-Tabor case, where a church wanted to hire </info>
    <info>ministers, even where that conflicted with non-discrimination laws, the </info>
    <info>state had to keep its hands off, that there was something precious and </info>
    <info>different about religious liberty, that a church must be allowed to </info>
    <info>decide who its leaders will be. That was a unanimous decision.</info>
    <info>    Then we have decisions interpreting some statutes, like the </info>
    <info>Religious Freedom and Restoration Act. Unanimously, the Supreme Court </info>
    <info>held you can't prosecute somebody who has a sincere belief in using a </info>
    <info>hallucinogenic tea, in the Gonzales case. And then you have the </info>
    <info>prisoner case involving a Muslim prisoner under a statute here we have </info>
    <info>that protects prisoner and religious rights, that a prisoner had a </info>
    <info>right to wear a beard, even though it wasn't an equality argument. It </info>
    <info>was a pure conscience versus the state argument. So I just think it's </info>
    <info>interesting that those three pure religious liberty cases were </info>
    <info>unanimous Supreme Court decisions, and the equality cases--while there </info>
    <info>are more of them and they have been moving in that equality direction, </info>
    <info>were more split in the court.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. There have been several references today to the subject </info>
    <info>of secularism. Father Deacon Andrew, you referred to a ``self-</info>
    <info>proclaimed neutral secular order'' that has limited conscience rights </info>
    <info>in the medical and legal profession in order to advance a prevailing </info>
    <info>secular orthodoxy, intolerant in genuine diversity. So just two quick </info>
    <info>questions for you, and then after you've answered----</info>
    <info>    Ms. Hope. Nathaniel, we've lost them.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Ah.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Hope. They'll be back, but you may want to----</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Let me move then onto the intersection between faith in </info>
    <info>the public square and social change movements--something of great </info>
    <info>significance here in the United States. Just an observation first. Many </info>
    <info>champions of the abolition of slavery, suffrage for women, and civil </info>
    <info>rights for African Americans were explicitly animated by their </info>
    <info>religious faith. It is rare to encounter contemporary criticisms of </info>
    <info>faith in the public square in these specific contexts. General organs </info>
    <info>as well as legal, policy, and cultural challenges against faith in the </info>
    <info>public square most often seem to arise when people of faith are </info>
    <info>advocating for something specific with which the critic disagrees. I'm </info>
    <info>wondering if you might be able to say a few words maybe elaborating a </info>
    <info>bit on the intersection between social change movements, the role that </info>
    <info>faith played in those, and then these discussions and debates that we </info>
    <info>have more broadly about faith in the public square, and whether or not </info>
    <info>you would concur that there may be a bit of inconsistency about the </info>
    <info>criticism.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Well, I would say that coming from the civil rights </info>
    <info>division, where we just celebrated our anniversary--we were founded in </info>
    <info>1958, so we had our 60th anniversary. We focused on our history, and we </info>
    <info>looked at Martin Luther King, who, A, was animated by faith. And I </info>
    <info>think that's what you're getting at. But also, he was imprisoned. His </info>
    <info>supporters had charges filed against them for disturbing the peace. He </info>
    <info>had a vision that conflicted with some of the mores and standards of </info>
    <info>the time and it was jarring. I'm always struck to look back, when we </info>
    <info>ask this question of just how critical his faith was to his movement, </info>
    <info>and also how much resistance he got. In retrospect Bill Nye said, Oh, </info>
    <info>yes, Martin Luther King, that's the paradigm of faith in the public </info>
    <info>square. But it was tumultuous at the time. And you can't get around </info>
    <info>that.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Looking at some of the debates and discussions today </info>
    <info>about a whole range of questions, ranging from immigration, to </info>
    <info>abortion, and everything in between, again this impression that some of </info>
    <info>us have that when people of faith bring their faith to the public </info>
    <info>square in a way that, when it comes to questions of law or policy, you </info>
    <info>happen to agree with, that often seems to be welcome, whereas where </info>
    <info>there's a point of disagreement, there's a bit of a pushback. Would you </info>
    <info>say that's a fair characterization?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Yes. And I think the Martin Luther King example </info>
    <info>exemplifies that. I'd be curious to see what Dr. van Bijsterveld sees </info>
    <info>as the Dutch--is she still on, or is just us?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. It's just us.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. It's just us. [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    Ms. Hope. We're trying to get them back.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. About just over a year ago there was an article published </info>
    <info>in the online publication Public Discourse. And it was authored by a </info>
    <info>professor, Dr. Margaret McCarthy. She teaches at the John Paul II </info>
    <info>Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family here in Washington at The </info>
    <info>Catholic University of America. To sort of summarize her argument, she </info>
    <info>was certainly sympathetic to why advocates for faith in the public </info>
    <info>square, in particular advocates for the religious freedom that enables </info>
    <info>faith in the public square, were primarily emphasizing and appealing to </info>
    <info>their sincerely held beliefs. She made explicit reference to our </info>
    <info>founding documents, to law, et cetera, et cetera.</info>
    <info>    And you know, a lot of case law that relates to this very much </info>
    <info>centers on that particular phrase. But her caution was that to people </info>
    <info>that may hold a different point of view about faith more generally, or </info>
    <info>at least faith in the public square, this may be something that's hard </info>
    <info>for them to understand.</info>
    <info>    She said, ``We ought to be aware of the cost we incur by appealing </info>
    <info>on such grounds. For reasons pertaining to the kind of religion that </info>
    <info>has dominated the American landscape and the narrow and reductive </info>
    <info>parameters of public reason in the liberal order, whatever we seek to </info>
    <info>defend in virtue of religious freedom [or the rights of conscience] </info>
    <info>will be invariably consigned to the realm of the private and </info>
    <info>`personal,' which is to say, the utterly irrational. To see this, one </info>
    <info>need only consider what it would mean for science were scientists to </info>
    <info>insist on the `freedom of their science' or to appeal to their </info>
    <info>`sincerely held beliefs about gravity.' Without diminishing the </info>
    <info>importance of the fight to keep culture-forming institutions open, it </info>
    <info>would be a Pyrrhic victory if success in the legal arena came at the </info>
    <info>cost of vindicating the view that a person's religion is essentially </info>
    <info>`nobody else's business.' '' And then she goes on to conclude, `` </info>
    <info>`Sincerely held beliefs' currently in question are not sincerely held </info>
    <info>beliefs at all, however much they have been privatized for their own </info>
    <info>safety. Rather, they are rational judgments about the nature of things, </info>
    <info>things that bear immediately on social and public life.''</info>
    <info>    She's proposing that maybe there's a bit of a tension when one </info>
    <info>looks in sort of a legal sphere and when one looks more broadly to the </info>
    <info>public square, the debate, the discussion of ideas, culture, society, </info>
    <info>et cetera. As somebody who has been working on these things for a very </info>
    <info>long time, particularly in the legal space, would you say this is sort </info>
    <info>of a reasonable characterization of a tension? Does this tension exist? </info>
    <info>And what are the implications if there is a desire to ensure that there </info>
    <info>is, in the eyes of the law, a legal space for faith in the public </info>
    <info>square, but at the same time not sort of conceding the privatization of </info>
    <info>religion. How do you sort of square that tension, if it does exist?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Well, I guess I would answer it in my role, which is </info>
    <info>someone at the Department of Justice. We're not concerned with what </info>
    <info>arguments are listened to, right? So it's for the legislators to decide </info>
    <info>what to listen to. It's for people in the public arena, writers, and </info>
    <info>all this to hear thoughts and decide what's good and what's not. But </info>
    <info>our role is to protect the fundamental rights. And we do that. We </info>
    <info>brought a case on behalf of a student in Georgia Gwinnett University </info>
    <info>who was told he could not proselytize on campus. He was confined to a </info>
    <info>narrow free speech zone. That free speech zone actually was between the </info>
    <info>dormitories and the classrooms and the rest of the facilities. This was </info>
    <info>primarily a commuter college. Basically they were saying, you can talk </info>
    <info>to 20 percent of the students, but the rest of them you've got no </info>
    <info>chance of talking to.</info>
    <info>    So we're defending their right to put forth their arguments. That's </info>
    <info>what the Constitution provides, various Federal laws provide. And </info>
    <info>that's really our role. As far as which arguments are going to be </info>
    <info>listened to and so forth, I'm going to leave that for other folks.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. One other question before we turn to the audience. I have </info>
    <info>a whole line of questions for our other panelists, and hopefully </info>
    <info>they'll be able to rejoin us. You sort of touch briefly on these three </info>
    <info>models of governance, if you will--theocracy, secularism, and </info>
    <info>pluralism. I appreciate the fact that you're trying to sort of stay </info>
    <info>within time, but I'm wondering if you could sort of unpack those a </info>
    <info>little bit more. And in particular, I'm wondering if you could walk us </info>
    <info>through how you understand the distinction sort of between secularism </info>
    <info>and pluralism.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Right. And I mentioned laicite, which is the French </info>
    <info>model, which is the public square should be secular. So, for example, </info>
    <info>barring girls from wearing religious clothing, the head scarves, hijab. </info>
    <info>We at Department of Justice went to court to protect a girl's right to </info>
    <info>wear a head scarf to school. The idea that the government shouldn't be </info>
    <info>in the business of making religious choices for people, but the </info>
    <info>government on the other hand should protect people's religious choices, </info>
    <info>should make space for them, so that when you go forth into a job, into </info>
    <info>a school, you don't have to leave that facet of your character behind. </info>
    <info>You can bring it with you, without offending the idea that we're going </info>
    <info>to be a country that doesn't establish one religion, that people can </info>
    <info>bring their religions with them, participate in public life, try to </info>
    <info>convince others share their faith with others.</info>
    <info>    Now, around a water cooler, if someone says, ``I don't want to hear </info>
    <info>any more about gun control,'' or whatever, pick your hot issue, you </info>
    <info>respect it, okay. You can step back. The same thing with religion. You </info>
    <info>shouldn't be overbearing with it. But you certainly should be able to </info>
    <info>share it with other people. That's the idea in a pluralistic model.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. While we wait for our other panelists to come back, I'm </info>
    <info>presuming there are some questions from the audience. As you can see, </info>
    <info>there's a standing mic right there. If you have a question, if you </info>
    <info>could please identify yourself by name and by organization as well.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. The monitor's dead.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Yes, I know. [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Good afternoon. My name is Joe Ramallo. I'm an intern </info>
    <info>for Congressman Leonard Lance over on the House side.</info>
    <info>    And I had a question today for you, Mr. Treene. Well, thanks for </info>
    <info>being here. But Mr. Hurd had asked a question early on in regard to </info>
    <info>some assumptions that the founding fathers, the framers of the </info>
    <info>Constitution might have made when writing the Constitution. And you had </info>
    <info>touched on the idea of inalienable rights. From what my understanding </info>
    <info>of inalienable rights are, that there is an assumption that a belief in </info>
    <info>a higher power is essential for the understanding or the belief in </info>
    <info>inalienable rights. So, A, my question is, is that an assumption the </info>
    <info>founding fathers had made? Second, more broadly, with that assumption </info>
    <info>then does the First Amendment not protect freedom from religion?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. No, certainly not. The founders certainly based this </info>
    <info>right on natural law, the idea of a creator endowing people with </info>
    <info>inalienable rights. But then look at the Constitution. Even before we </info>
    <info>have the Bill of Rights we have the Constitution, which says there </info>
    <info>shall be no religious test for public office. Right from the get-go I </info>
    <info>think this comes down into this idea of the pluralistic model. The </info>
    <info>pluralistic model doesn't push out religion from public life. You can </info>
    <info>say, yes, the founders had a vision that religious liberty came from </info>
    <info>God. But at the same time, that religious liberty applies to everybody, </info>
    <info>believer and nonbeliever alike.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Any other questions? Well, I have one more.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Okay. [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. I do wonder sometimes whether the friction between people </info>
    <info>of religious faith and people who may not have religious faith may </info>
    <info>sometimes partially be rooted in a real or perceived lack of advocacy </info>
    <info>on behalf of another, that is, the perception on the one hand is that </info>
    <info>people of religious faith are not sort of robust enough in advocating </info>
    <info>for the freedom of belief and conscience of the people who don't have </info>
    <info>religious faith, and vice versa. I'm wondering, as you look back </info>
    <info>through American law and public policy, some of the sort of laws and </info>
    <info>statutes and sort of policies that we've seen, the public writings, et </info>
    <info>cetera, from some of our founding fathers, were they just confined and </info>
    <info>constrained to people of religious faith, or did they in fact cover </info>
    <info>people who might not have religious faith?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Well, let me answer it this way: The Supreme Court's </info>
    <info>been pretty clear on conscientious objector decisions that our </info>
    <info>tradition of giving conscientious objection, which dates back to the </info>
    <info>Civil War and the Quakers, nonetheless applies broadly to anyone with a </info>
    <info>belief in the immorality of fighting a war that is general as opposed </info>
    <info>to specific and opposed to a particular war. But anything, as they say, </info>
    <info>that occupies the same space as traditional religious faith. So that </info>
    <info>was a broad statement. It wouldn't cover everything, right? So any sort </info>
    <info>of moral conclusion you came to that this was an unjust war. If </info>
    <info>somebody has a deep-seated belief that war was wrong, it's as </info>
    <info>comprehensive as to occupy the same space as religious faith, the </info>
    <info>Supreme Court said that will suffice.</info>
    <info>    And it's the same thing when we look at free exercise of religion. </info>
    <info>They look at what is sincerely held. Not does your belief kind of </info>
    <info>reflect one of the major religions or even one of the minor religions. </info>
    <info>There is a famous case involving Jehovah's Witnesses, and one said she </info>
    <info>could not make tank turrets. And the employer said, wait a minute, this </info>
    <info>other Jehovah's Witness who works for me makes tank turrets. Point to </info>
    <info>me in the Jehovah's Witness documents where this violates your faith. </info>
    <info>And the Supreme Court said, no. You can be a religion of one to have </info>
    <info>that deep faith that we are going to protect. So I think that--mostly </info>
    <info>it's just a question--we'll leave it to the philosophers to answer the </info>
    <info>rest of it.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. And maybe just to tease something out about it, is the </info>
    <info>understanding you just mentioned--is that in large part because there </info>
    <info>has been a long-held deference to the rights of individuals and groups </info>
    <info>to understand their own faith as they see fit, as opposed to having to </info>
    <info>sort of demonstrate or prove something correct?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Yes. It goes back to Madison, right? Sort of conscience </info>
    <info>is king, right? It would be very strange indeed if we said we're going </info>
    <info>to define conscience according to how the government wants to define </info>
    <info>conscience. But, no, rather they give it a broad reading, looking from </info>
    <info>the standpoint of the person claiming the right of conscience.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Any other questions from the audience?</info>
    <info>    I've actually been told that we're trying to get a bit of a </info>
    <info>technical fix. So maybe if we could take maybe a 5-minute break, and </info>
    <info>then we'll see if we can reconvene. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    [Break.]</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Great. With our panelists in Canada and Europe rejoining </info>
    <info>us, we'll get back to some of the questions that I had intended to ask. </info>
    <info>And again, we'll open it up again.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. So I get a break now? I can, like, go get coffee and--</info>
    <info>[inaudible]? [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. There were several references that you made to </info>
    <info>secularism.</info>
    <info>    And Father Deacon Andrew, you referred to a quote, ``Self-</info>
    <info>proclaimed neutral secular order that has limited conscience rights in </info>
    <info>the medical and legal professions in order to advance a prevailing </info>
    <info>secular orthodoxy, intolerant of genuine diversity.'' If this type of </info>
    <info>secularism is not neutral, what is it? A second question would be, is </info>
    <info>there such a thing as neutral secularism?</info>
    <info>    And I'm also wondering if you think that debates in the public </info>
    <info>square suffer to a certain extent from the lack of a self-awareness and </info>
    <info>openness about one's first principles? My impression from your comment </info>
    <info>about neutral secularism was that there is a perception of neutrality </info>
    <info>that doesn't actually reflect the reality.</info>
    <info>    So if you could answer those three and then, Dr. Van Bijsterveld, </info>
    <info>I'll have some questions for you.</info>
    <info>    Rev. Bennett. Sure. Well, I have a certain knowledge, adding onto </info>
    <info>Professor Van Bijesterveld's arguments about there being a secularism, </info>
    <info>that there are various meanings of secularism. Charles Taylor has </info>
    <info>really charted those quite nicely in ``A Secular Age,'' that the </info>
    <info>understanding of secularism has evolved. Now I would say, certainly in </info>
    <info>Canada and maybe also in other Western democracies, there is a premise </info>
    <info>that secularism is neutral, that it appears at a neutral space where </info>
    <info>people of different beliefs can exist. But in fact, certainly in the </info>
    <info>Canadian case, what we're seeing is not that type of what I would call </info>
    <info>open secularism, but rather a secular position that itself is a value </info>
    <info>proposition and it has a particular faith, it has particular practices.</info>
    <info>    I would say, in Canada certainly, the types of secularism we're </info>
    <info>seeing in our institutions is a type of secularism that tolerates </info>
    <info>diversity, but it's a prescribed diversity. As long as you're the sort </info>
    <info>of diversity that we like and fits with our definition of a diverse </info>
    <info>society, then you're fine. However, if you hold beliefs or views that </info>
    <info>contravene or are different from that identified diversity, then you </info>
    <info>are going to be on the outs within society. I think there's the </info>
    <info>possibility for the state to be neutral.</info>
    <info>    I'm glad that in Canada we have a secular state. I wouldn't want a </info>
    <info>particular religious community being bound together with the state. </info>
    <info>That secular model is very good, but it needs to be, in Charles </info>
    <info>Taylor's way of expressing it, an open secularism where the state </info>
    <info>ensures that people of different religious beliefs, different belief </info>
    <info>systems generally, are able to flourish within the body politic. A </info>
    <info>closed secularism is where the state would dictate that there could be </info>
    <info>no public displays of religion.</info>
    <info>    I think in Canada right now, a lot of communities, but I would say </info>
    <info>in particularly in my own Christian community, certainly Catholics and </info>
    <info>also Protestants of different traditions, I would say in many ways have </info>
    <info>accepted implicitly the privatization of public faith, that there has </info>
    <info>been a willingness to back away from the public square in order to </info>
    <info>embrace this desire for tolerance, a desire to have a neutrality. In </info>
    <info>fact in backing away of the public square and into the comfortable pew, </info>
    <info>let's say, where religious practice is simply something for the place </info>
    <info>of worship or for the home, that public square then is a vacuum, it's </info>
    <info>vacated by people of religious belief and there's a vacuum created, </info>
    <info>which will be filled. When you have that vacant space, it means that </info>
    <info>public debate is not being enriched by those particular religious </info>
    <info>traditions.</info>
    <info>    I think a genuine pluralism is a very deep pluralism where you have </info>
    <info>people of many different beliefs, many different philosophical </info>
    <info>perspectives who are able to meet in the public square and engage with </info>
    <info>one another. I think that's what we should be striving for and that, I </info>
    <info>think, is at the heart of religious freedom in democracies.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Van Bijsterveld, you spoke of at least two terms, programmatic </info>
    <info>secularism and procedural secularism, defining programmatic secularism </info>
    <info>as one that stands for fending off manifestations of religion in the </info>
    <info>public square and procedural secularism that is, as you put it, </info>
    <info>fundamentally open to manifestations of religion in the public square, </info>
    <info>the state itself being the secular. Are programmatic and procedural </info>
    <info>secularisms limited to law, policy and regulation or do they extend </info>
    <info>into other spheres, like culture?</info>
    <info>    Dr. van Bijsterveld. Well, yes. First of all, I think it's very </info>
    <info>helpful, and the distinction is not my own, I derived it from the </info>
    <info>former archbishop of Canterbury. He says this procedural secularism, in </info>
    <info>which he defines a state as a community of communities where various </info>
    <info>voices may ring, is where the state itself has an ideal where fills to </info>
    <info>public domains. What you would see is that in Western European </info>
    <info>countries, the French laicite, the French system of church-state, in my </info>
    <info>view, comes very close to that programmatic secularism. Whereas other </info>
    <info>countries, for instance my own country, but also other European </info>
    <info>countries, are much more, in the sense, procedural secularism.</info>
    <info>    He also talked about the word ``neutrality'' of the state and finds </info>
    <info>the word ``neutrality'' very complicated and also very confusing and </info>
    <info>fuzzy because neutrality of the state does not mean you're value </info>
    <info>neutral, states are not value neutral, states in its policies is </info>
    <info>continuously involved with all sorts of values. It's not value neutral.</info>
    <info>    But what could it mean? In my view, it would mean that the state </info>
    <info>does not identify with one particular faith tradition. That seems to </info>
    <info>say it's neutral, it doesn't identify with one particular faith </info>
    <info>tradition. It can also mean that the state has a fundamental openness </info>
    <info>for all religions.</info>
    <info>    I'm not so much in favor of using the words because it can mean so </info>
    <info>many things, ``neutrality.'' If you use it, you should be very clear in </info>
    <info>how you use it. In my sense, it certainly would mean that the state </info>
    <info>does not identify with one particular tradition. Don't let us think </info>
    <info>that the state is value neutral, because the state isn't.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Mr. Treene, it's very striking in looking at the </info>
    <info>establishment clause, that is that the state will not establish a </info>
    <info>religion or favor any particular religion, that it seems to stand </info>
    <info>somewhat in contrast with what we saw from some of the earliest </info>
    <info>European settlers to the United States. I'm wondering, as someone who's </info>
    <info>a bit of a historian when it comes to religious freedom and our </info>
    <info>founding documents, the Founders, of course, were bearing in mind the </info>
    <info>European experience where there was a very strong intermingling of sort </info>
    <info>of temporal power and faith and religion in a very sort of explicit and </info>
    <info>official way. Then, of course, they also were bearing in mind the early </info>
    <info>American experience as well. Can you, to the extent that we sort of </info>
    <info>have a sense of reflections on our own history here and that sort of </info>
    <info>early pre-United States period--was that something that they very much </info>
    <info>were thinking about?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Sure. The presumption in Europe was that this is the </info>
    <info>1600s, 1700s and earlier was that, a godly king would make sure that </info>
    <info>people within their kingdom followed the faith. That was not seen as </info>
    <info>controversial. As I said, it was sort of a milder theocracy that you </info>
    <info>saw in England where people were tolerated, but be taxed for support of </info>
    <info>the Anglican Church, you could not work on the Sabbath and heresy was </info>
    <info>punishable.</info>
    <info>    When they passed the Virginia Statute on Religious Freedom, though, </info>
    <info>that swept all that away and it was sort of a two-part thing. It was </info>
    <info>the defeat of a bill that would have supported clergy in the State of </info>
    <info>Virginia, there would only be a few chosen sects that would have been </info>
    <info>supported, so it essentially established the Anglican Church as the </info>
    <info>main church and then a few others as well. And they struck down that </info>
    <info>law.</info>
    <info>    Then the statute banned any heresy laws, laws barring people who </info>
    <info>were atheists from serving as executors of wills and a whole range of </info>
    <info>laws that were swept away to preserve that fundamental--again, that </info>
    <info>duality of we're not going to establish religion, but at the same time </info>
    <info>we're going to let people exercise their religion as their conscience </info>
    <info>leads them and we will not tolerate any civil burdens or punishments.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. The next basket of questions has to do with the subjects </info>
    <info>of friendship and civic engagement.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Van Bijsterveld had said that, ``for both public authorities </info>
    <info>and religious communities, it is important to get to know each other, </info>
    <info>if they do not already.'' One could argue that this could actually be </info>
    <info>extended to sort of the full range of persons and relationships in a </info>
    <info>society.</info>
    <info>    There's a very interesting and compelling book written by a </info>
    <info>political scientist--he's now at Brown, he was at Michigan when he </info>
    <info>wrote it--named Ashutosh Varshney. It's called ``Ethnic Conflict and </info>
    <info>Civic Life: Hindus and Muslims in India.'' He and his team looked at </info>
    <info>this massive dataset, focusing on violence between Hindus and Muslims </info>
    <info>in the Indian context. A lot of the research that had been done to that </info>
    <info>point had focused on where violence had happened and why it had </info>
    <info>happened. He was more interested in why it didn't happen in particular </info>
    <info>places. You might have the same rumor, the same spark that had sort of </info>
    <info>prompted violence in another place, and yet in this other location, we </info>
    <info>didn't see it. So the question was, why?</info>
    <info>    His thesis basically is that in these areas where the violence </info>
    <info>didn't happen, there was very strong civic life. And what he meant by </info>
    <info>that very specifically was you had Hindus and Muslims who came together </info>
    <info>for cricket clubs or for book clubs or they had gotten tired of the </info>
    <info>local sanitation not working and had decided it was time to come </info>
    <info>together and do something about it. So they got to know each other in a </info>
    <info>way where they weren't just sitting around and sort of having what we </info>
    <info>might traditionally think of as interreligious dialog. These were </info>
    <info>people who just kind of got to know each other and said as human </info>
    <info>persons they had a common interest, maybe a common objective. Because </info>
    <info>they got to know each other in an organizational context, when there </info>
    <info>was conflict they were able to organize each other, they were able to </info>
    <info>organize very, very quickly.</info>
    <info>    So, Father Deacon and Dr. Van Bijsterveld, with that in mind, what </info>
    <info>is the role of friendship and working together on common interests or </info>
    <info>working together on a common good specifically between people of </info>
    <info>religious faith and people of no religious faith to sort of engage in </info>
    <info>the enterprise, as Father Deacon put it, building our common life so </info>
    <info>that our fellow human beings may flourish?</info>
    <info>    Dr. van Bijsterveld. Are you asking me?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. I'm asking both of you.</info>
    <info>    Dr. van Bijsterveld. Okay. Well, thank you. Well, I think it is </info>
    <info>very important indeed. Of course, friendship is maybe a lot to ask, but </info>
    <info>at least it's important that people need each other and that they </info>
    <info>engage in professional relationships or other civic relationships </info>
    <info>concerning civic activities. Because if you don't know each other, it's </info>
    <info>very difficult to form a good understanding of the other. So, yes, I </info>
    <info>think it is very important.</info>
    <info>    I think it is also especially important also in the law. If you </info>
    <info>look at the history of church-state relationships in the Netherlands, </info>
    <info>for example, we often think that they have evolved because the lawyers </info>
    <info>got better understanding of the law and of religious freedom, and it </info>
    <info>was implemented in a better way. Of course, that is true to a large </info>
    <info>extent. In retrospect, we could also see these developments of more </info>
    <info>relaxation of church-state relationships in the function of a societal </info>
    <info>element where different new religious organizations got to know each </info>
    <info>other and got to know the state and the other way around. I think that </info>
    <info>is very important now where in Western Europe we have a large presence </info>
    <info>of Islam, but Islam is still very much unknown to us, and so are the </info>
    <info>different groups. So my answer is yes.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Father Deacon?</info>
    <info>    Rev. Bennett. I would say I think there is, in the case of Canada, </info>
    <info>and certainly I would hazard to guess it would be the same for the </info>
    <info>United States, we are a country that has, for most of our history, been </info>
    <info>very diverse. You can walk down any street in this country and you just </info>
    <info>see that diversity is a demographic reality. This is a very diverse </info>
    <info>country. Friendship between people of different faiths and different </info>
    <info>beliefs is essential for that flourishing that I mentioned, for that </info>
    <info>flourishing to build a common life together.</info>
    <info>    Now, if the official narrative or the narrative that is coming out </info>
    <info>of our institutions is that somehow, implicitly, religion can be a </info>
    <info>source of potential conflict and so, therefore, we can't have public </info>
    <info>expressions of religion because that emphasizes maybe too much </info>
    <info>difference and, therefore, we're not going to be able to build some </info>
    <info>sort of perceived or false neutral society--if that's the case, then </info>
    <info>it's going to be very hard for us to encounter one another and to share </info>
    <info>our different faiths.</info>
    <info>    I think this is particularly true in the university, in the </info>
    <info>workplace, in the factory, wherever it might be. So often we are told </info>
    <info>or we are conditioned socially to leave our religious faith at home. We </info>
    <info>have a little box on our table as we exit the house and we open the box </info>
    <info>each morning, we drop our religious faith in there only to pick it up </info>
    <info>when we come back home in the evening. When we're in the public space, </info>
    <info>when we're at the university, when we're in our office, God forbid we </info>
    <info>talk about our religious beliefs because it might offend someone or it </info>
    <info>might lead to some sort of conflict. I think that is a very unfortunate </info>
    <info>and very misguided approach.</info>
    <info>    Rather, we should be allowed to be our entire selves. Certainly, </info>
    <info>this is a narrative that is dominant on a whole range of different </info>
    <info>identities, whether we're talking--[inaudible]--certainly of a strength </info>
    <info>about allowing people to be themselves. That's the same for the </info>
    <info>religious self. We have to be able to live our lives, our religious </info>
    <info>lives, publicly.</info>
    <info>    Historically throughout human history, our religious lives have </info>
    <info>been lived publicly and that needs to be encouraged. Because when we </info>
    <info>encounter one another and we encounter one another not in some sort of </info>
    <info>relativistic, mushy middle where there's some sort of false consensus, </info>
    <info>when we encounter one another and we can say ``I profoundly disagree </info>
    <info>with your religious beliefs or I profoundly disagree with your moral </info>
    <info>perspective, but I still recognize in you my neighbor and I still </info>
    <info>recognize in you that you have a dignity as a human being and I am </info>
    <info>called to be in a relationship with you so that we can build a society </info>
    <info>together.'' That needs to be the narrative, rather than pushing </info>
    <info>religious belief into the dark places, because that is not healthy.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Yes, just to respond to that, I agree, there's a </info>
    <info>temptation to think that the more we allow for religious expression and </info>
    <info>religious liberty, we're going to end up with more religious conflict </info>
    <info>as people knock against each other in the public square. Actually, the </info>
    <info>data suggests otherwise.</info>
    <info>    Tim Shah at Georgetown University, a sociologist, has done a lot of </info>
    <info>work on this. If you plot out the levels of religious conflict in a </info>
    <info>country and you also looked at the level of religious liberty, what you </info>
    <info>actually find is, in general, there are a few outliers--but the more </info>
    <info>freedom you have, the less social conflict you have between religious </info>
    <info>groups. It's those countries that try to tamp down on religious freedom </info>
    <info>that end up having the greatest interreligious conflict.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. I know that one of the legal questions that has come up </info>
    <info>in the last decade, 15-plus years in particular, has been this question </info>
    <info>of federal grants going to faith-based entities, particularly faith-</info>
    <info>based organizations. And the charge has been that this is a violation </info>
    <info>of the establishment clause, that the government is essentially </info>
    <info>weighing in.</info>
    <info>    Is it that? Or is it ensuring that faith-based entities are able to </info>
    <info>compete for grants just as any other entity, whether secular or not?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Well, to go back to something that Dr. Van Bijsterveld </info>
    <info>said at the beginning, we said tension between religious equality </info>
    <info>arguments and religious autonomy, this one involves both: The idea that </info>
    <info>a religious group shouldn't have to compromise its beliefs and, say, </info>
    <info>set up a secular parallel organization to carry out social works, that </info>
    <info>it can integrate those. That's the autonomy.</info>
    <info>    But also, the equality argument is, if they're offering a secular </info>
    <info>service--a homeless shelter, a jobs program--shouldn't the religious </info>
    <info>organization be equal in coming forward with a plan that they think is </info>
    <info>effective? And can't the government, if it's a secular program, fund </info>
    <info>it, even if it's run by a religious group? That's something that the </info>
    <info>Bush administration, the Obama administration, the Trump administration </info>
    <info>have all embraced. This initiative has continued through all three of </info>
    <info>those administrations.</info>
    <info>    And I'd be very curious to see how that's handled in Canada and in </info>
    <info>the Netherlands. My take is that, generally, other countries aren't as </info>
    <info>cautious about government funding in those situations.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Yes. If the two of you would like to respond to that, </info>
    <info>that would be great.</info>
    <info>    Rev. Bennett. Well, certainly in the Canadian case, separation of </info>
    <info>church and state is not a constitutional principle in Canada. We don't </info>
    <info>have the non-establishment clause or the free-exercise clause. </info>
    <info>Certainly, freedom of religion or conscience in the Charter of Rights </info>
    <info>and Freedoms would be sort of rough equivalency of the free-exercise </info>
    <info>clause. But in Canada you will have provincial governments, municipal </info>
    <info>governments, the Federal Government providing support to a variety of </info>
    <info>faith-based institutions. Certainly in the province of Ontario, </info>
    <info>taxpayer dollars are used to support a very wide and large network of </info>
    <info>publicly funded Catholic schools in the province. That's been there for </info>
    <info>a considerable period of time.</info>
    <info>    I would say that there's a fairly well-established series of </info>
    <info>programs for federal funding and provincial funding where faith-based </info>
    <info>groups can obtain funding to support, in many cases, explicitly faith-</info>
    <info>based activities. We certainly have, as in the United States, a wide </info>
    <info>array of public holidays that are oriented to the Christian calendar. </info>
    <info>People are being paid to not be at work those days. That's another </info>
    <info>example that I think often gets overlooked in the United States.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. And Dr. Van Bijsterveld, any reflections on the European </info>
    <info>context?</info>
    <info>    Dr. van Bijsterveld. Yes. If I may take that situation as an </info>
    <info>example, it's a fairly highly developed social welfare state where the </info>
    <info>state, of course, plays a very strong role in the redistribution of </info>
    <info>finances for public goals. The basic rule is that if the state gives </info>
    <info>subsidies for carrying out the activities that it wants to promote, </info>
    <info>then faith-based organizations should not be excluded on the basis of </info>
    <info>their faith, only when it compounds very specific differences, </info>
    <info>functional differences, then a difference may be made. But not on the </info>
    <info>basis of faith.</info>
    <info>    Maybe for an American audience, it's also interesting to say that </info>
    <info>our whole organization of our educational system shows this basic </info>
    <info>understanding very much. We have a dual system where state education </info>
    <info>and public education exists next to private education and private </info>
    <info>education is practically 100 percent also conventional education. The </info>
    <info>states raise funds for public education, public schools, but also for </info>
    <info>those private conventional schools. Of course, those private </info>
    <info>conventional schools are subject to most regulations that the state </info>
    <info>schools are subject to as well, of course with the exception of </info>
    <info>respectful religious identity.</info>
    <info>    Now what we've seen with the retreat of the social welfare state </info>
    <info>somewhat in the financial domain, they have these cooperation </info>
    <info>arrangements also exist. We even see new forms of cooperation between </info>
    <info>states and the church exist also on a financial level.</info>
    <info>    Rev. Bennett. I think just to add to that, in the immediate case, </info>
    <info>we have seen increasing tensions around the role that particularly </info>
    <info>provincial funding for Catholic education and especially there have </info>
    <info>been some fault lines that have been drawn over the last little while.</info>
    <info>    Also, with private schools that receive virtually no state funding, </info>
    <info>there was a very famous case that went up to the supreme court of </info>
    <info>Canada involving an independent Catholic high school, Jesuit high </info>
    <info>school, in Montreal, Loyola High School. The provincial government in </info>
    <info>Quebec brought in a new curriculum on teaching basically values and </info>
    <info>ethics that was very--again, to use the word--neutral in that you could </info>
    <info>not approach it from a particular faith perspective. This curriculum </info>
    <info>was imposed on all schools across the province. Loyola said ``we will </info>
    <info>not teach this according to the model that you've put forward, we will </info>
    <info>teach it from a Catholic perspective, we're not going to teach that all </info>
    <info>faiths are equal, we believe that there is a preeminence for </info>
    <info>Catholicism because that's what we confess.'' The province took them to </info>
    <info>court. In the end, the supreme court of Canada found in favor of Loyola </info>
    <info>High School and said that as an independent Catholic school they had a </info>
    <info>right to teach their students about their particular Catholic faith, </info>
    <info>regardless of what the province had to say about it.</info>
    <info>    There are, even in a very strong social welfare state like Canada </info>
    <info>or the Netherlands, there are some fault lines emerging, and certainly </info>
    <info>here in Canada.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Just on the subject of federal funding, we have a bit of </info>
    <info>a different legal regime in the United States. There is, both for </info>
    <info>funding purposes, for development, and also for activities in the </info>
    <info>United States, there is an explicit prohibition on the use of those for </info>
    <info>religious purposes, correct?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. We don't want to get into all the legal niceties, but </info>
    <info>there's a difference we have between direct aid, which is the </info>
    <info>government giving money to an organization directly, choosing a </info>
    <info>provider, like saying you have a good homeless shelter, I'm going to </info>
    <info>fund you. If that's the case, it has to be a purely secular program.</info>
    <info>    If, however, it's an indirect aid, like we say we're going to give </info>
    <info>people job training scholarships or a piece of paper that lets them get </info>
    <info>job training and they want to take that to any job training that they </info>
    <info>choose. Salvation Army has a program that integrates ministry and drug </info>
    <info>treatment and job training and so forth, that's fine as long as it's </info>
    <info>the person's choice to take that and indirectly give it to a religious </info>
    <info>purpose. That's getting into the niceties of American law.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. We have a question from the audience.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. I was just wondering, all three of you have spoken </info>
    <info>about the importance of, one way or the other of whether we like </info>
    <info>neutrality or not, the government not taking sides in religious </info>
    <info>controversies--you know, not writing prayers for schools and so on. I'm </info>
    <info>just looking in this pamphlet of the 68 countries listed among the OSCE </info>
    <info>participating States and their partners. I don't know about a lot of </info>
    <info>them, but I have in my head at least 26 of them don't at all fit that </info>
    <info>model. So I was just wondering--and even if you go back as recently as, </info>
    <info>say, when President Reagan was saying that Engel v. Vitale was wrongly </info>
    <info>decided and that there should be still prayers allowed in American </info>
    <info>public schools. Most of our own history in this country doesn't seem to </info>
    <info>reflect that, a lot of these other countries don't.</info>
    <info>    I was just wondering, for the three of you, from the point of view </info>
    <info>of international religious freedom as promoted by the Helsinki Accords, </info>
    <info>how important, even if you think that it's better to have a government </info>
    <info>that doesn't take sides in these discussions, how important do you </info>
    <info>think it is for the human right of religious freedom that the </info>
    <info>government not takes sides in religious questions? Or is it licit for a </info>
    <info>government to hold one particular religious tradition or set of </info>
    <info>traditions in a public place of honor and give it place over others?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. And if you could--your name and affiliation?</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Sorry. Dan Burns, Catholic University of America.</info>
    <info>    Rev. Bennett. Sure. That's a very good question. As was raised </info>
    <info>earlier on, there are various types of state systems in relation </info>
    <info>between religion and the state.</info>
    <info>    I think, certainly as a Canadian, we come out of the British </info>
    <info>tradition very strongly. In the United Kingdom right now, there are two </info>
    <info>established churches--there's the Church of England and the Church of </info>
    <info>Scotland. They're both established, and so there's a precedence for </info>
    <info>them, particularly the Church of England, with bishops sitting as </info>
    <info>spiritual peers and as lords. There's a particular preeminence for </info>
    <info>Church of England schools and so forth.</info>
    <info>    The United Kingdom over its history has been able to fairly </info>
    <info>successfully evolve into a state where you have an established church, </info>
    <info>yet there is a very strong pluralism and respect for religious </info>
    <info>difference. I think that model is acceptable as long as there is that </info>
    <info>respect for pluralism and the state is, while being tied to a </info>
    <info>particular church or a particular faith, it does respect the rights of </info>
    <info>all of its citizens to live out their faith freely, both privately in </info>
    <info>terms of worship and their practices at home, but also publicly, to act </info>
    <info>on that faith in the public square.</info>
    <info>    When you look at it sort of through history, very often, certainly </info>
    <info>in the case of the church, when the church and the state have been </info>
    <info>fused, it's usually in the end not been that good for the church, but </info>
    <info>the state certainly hasn't suffered. I would argue, from my own </info>
    <info>perspective, from the perspective of the Canadian experience, that it's </info>
    <info>good not to have a particular established religion, but rather that the </info>
    <info>state should be very broad in its understanding of religious freedom </info>
    <info>and should be very respectful to those citizens who do want to have </info>
    <info>religion playing a central role in their lives, again, publicly and </info>
    <info>privately.</info>
    <info>    There needs to be greater breadth than there is currently for a </info>
    <info>state such as Canada. There needs to be a much broader understanding of </info>
    <info>religious freedom rather than a narrowing as we're seeing.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Treene. Yes, I would say in the U.S. context, the Founders in </info>
    <info>this respect, like in so many other respects, were both idealistic and </info>
    <info>pragmatic. The idealistic vision is conscience, protection of </info>
    <info>conscience, and they decided, looking back at history, established </info>
    <info>churches tended to infringe conscience. I don't think it's the </info>
    <info>establishment clause itself is a fundamental principle the way that </info>
    <info>conscience is, but it's seen by the Founders as that which will lead to </info>
    <info>the protection of conscience the same way many of our liberties are, </info>
    <info>how they designed the United States, the Government, and divided the </info>
    <info>powers. There's nothing in principle about division of three branches </info>
    <info>of government that leads to liberty, but the ultimate goal was the </info>
    <info>preservation of liberty and true democracy.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Dr. Van Bijsterveld?</info>
    <info>    Dr. van Bijsterveld. Yes. In Europe, of course, our situation is </info>
    <info>quite different from the United States. In many countries, there are </info>
    <info>stratified systems of a church-state relationship. And the ultimate </info>
    <info>example is, of course, a country where there is an established church. </info>
    <info>We have various countries like that in Europe. England has been </info>
    <info>mentioned as an example, but also Denmark or Greece. Among them, those </info>
    <info>countries are quite different. For instance, in England the state and </info>
    <info>church are really two different entities--the state and the Anglican </info>
    <info>Church--but there are a number of connections between them, </info>
    <info>institutionalized connections. In Denmark, for instance, it's very </info>
    <info>difficult to distinguish the established church from the state as an </info>
    <info>organization. In Greece, it's different altogether.</info>
    <info>    Apart from those state churches, there are also stratified systems </info>
    <info>in which the states cooperate with particular churches or give some </info>
    <info>churches a more elevated status. Usually, that is a system that is open </info>
    <info>for all churches who fit the particular requirements.</info>
    <info>    I agree also with Andrew when it says that the issue is not so much </info>
    <info>if there is a stratified system or whether there is an established </info>
    <info>church. The basic issue is, given the system, is there real religious </info>
    <info>freedom and also equality regardless of religion?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. Thank you. We'll have one last call for questions from </info>
    <info>the audience and then we'll wrap after that.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Hi. I have a question for Mr. Bennett, although, as far </info>
    <info>as I understand, he's looking at my back. So that's really rude of me, </info>
    <info>I'm really sorry. [Laughs.]</info>
    <info>    My name is Ann Sineva. I am working on government affairs and </info>
    <info>public policy here in D.C. with the Church of Scientology National </info>
    <info>Affairs Office.</info>
    <info>    It's good to see you, Mr. Bennett, again in your new capacity.</info>
    <info>    Rev. Bennett. Nice to see you.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Yes, I have a question about mostly civil society </info>
    <info>because there was a lot said tonight about church versus the </info>
    <info>government. I want to challenge you on something you said earlier </info>
    <info>today. Actually, I would be very honored if other panelists commented </info>
    <info>as well, but the reason why I'm singling out Mr. Bennett is because he </info>
    <info>said something earlier, which I'm paraphrasing slightly, but you said </info>
    <info>that in a truly diverse, pluralistic society, people would live with </info>
    <info>different theological and ethical views. I wanted to challenge you on </info>
    <info>the point about ethical and see if you had more to say on that and </info>
    <info>could elaborate. Because I believe that if we had a society built with </info>
    <info>people that had completely different ethical views and no agreed-upon </info>
    <info>moral code, then it would no longer be a community, a society.</info>
    <info>    So, obviously, the Supreme Court takes cases concerning ethical </info>
    <info>matters and Mr. Treene deals with that constantly in his work. I'm </info>
    <info>curious to see your perspective as a religious leader, what do you tell </info>
    <info>your congregation? Where is the common-sense ground there between our </info>
    <info>differences, but also ethical points that we could survive on together?</info>
    <info>    Rev. Bennett. Yes, very good question. Thank you for the point. </info>
    <info>Just by stating that, obviously, I'm a Catholic, I'm a deacon in the </info>
    <info>Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and so I believe that what I hold to </info>
    <info>be true, both in terms of my theology, in terms of my ethical view and </info>
    <info>my moral views that stem from that theology and from a Christian </info>
    <info>anthropology, I believe that to be true. I believe it to be true not </info>
    <info>just for me, but I believe it to be true for all of you. It's a </info>
    <info>universal and objective truth, ethics and so forth. I think that as a </info>
    <info>society, we should strive to have a common ethic and a common set of </info>
    <info>moral beliefs that champion the whole dignity of the human person.</info>
    <info>    I'm also part of a society. There are going to be people who </info>
    <info>disagree with me. So then, how do we go on? I think we have, again, an </info>
    <info>open public square where I have the ability as a Catholic to try and </info>
    <info>convince others of the truth of my belief. If, however, the public </info>
    <info>square becomes tightened and if it's constrained to me and I can no </info>
    <info>longer do that, then I'm going to be frustrated in my citizenship and </info>
    <info>I'm going to probably begin to retreat.</info>
    <info>    It's not that I have a relativistic approach to ethics. I believe </info>
    <info>that the ethic that I profess and try to live as a Christian, as a </info>
    <info>Catholic, is true. I believe it's objectively and universally true, but </info>
    <info>I need the ability in the public square to express that. And when I </info>
    <info>come up against people that have different moral, ethical, theological, </info>
    <info>philosophical beliefs, I need to be able to dialog with them. I need to </info>
    <info>be able to engage with them. And I need to see in them a common </info>
    <info>humanity with me.</info>
    <info>    We need common humanity and we need to be able to build a society </info>
    <info>based on that common humanity, but also recognizing that there are very </info>
    <info>different belief systems out there and a lot of us are going to claim </info>
    <info>that our belief systems are true. That's the nature of society--it's a </info>
    <info>very messy business, but there has to be that space in the public </info>
    <info>square to engage with one another and to have the ability to convince </info>
    <info>the other.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Hurd. I want to thank our panelists.</info>
    <info>    I want to thank those of you who came here today, those of you that </info>
    <info>are watching online, and also a special thanks to my colleagues, to </info>
    <info>Jordan, our hearing coordinator, to Stacy, our communications director, </info>
    <info>to Cade and Thea, our fellows, and Alexa and Cecilia, our interns, for </info>
    <info>helping put this together.</info>
    <info>    This was certainly not intended to be comprehensive--impossible to </info>
    <info>be so in so short a period of time--but hopefully it has added </info>
    <info>something to the conversations that are happening off the Hill.</info>
    <info>    Thank you. [Applause.]</info>
    <info>    Whereupon, at 4:16 p.m., the briefing ended.</info>
