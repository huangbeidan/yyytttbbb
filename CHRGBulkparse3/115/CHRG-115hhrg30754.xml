Communications and Technology; Sean Farrell, Professional Staff 
Member, Communications and Technology; Adam Fromm, Director of 
Outreach and Coalitions; Elena Hernandez, Press Secretary; Tim

    Mr. Shimkus [presiding]. We are going to call the hearing 
to order and get our panelists to take seats. That's to help us 
get our arrangement for how we ask questions. They've called 
votes. So we are going to adjourn--I mean, recess.
    We are going to go vote, and then we are going to come 
back. So you can keep walking around. But your place in line 
has been saved.
    So with that----
    [Recess.]

    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN">Mrs. Blackburn [presiding]. All right. The committee will 
reconvene, and I recognize myself for 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN">And I want to welcome you all. I apologize to everyone. We 
thought we had votes at 10:00, and then it was going to be 
10:10 and come on back over here--you know, it's just one of 
those days--a getaway day, an omnibus day, and we are going to 
go ahead and start this hearing because you never know when the 
bell is going to go off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN">A little less than 2 months ago, we did our first 
legislative hearing. This is our second. We sat here in this 
room discussing 25 pieces of legislation addressing broadband 
infrastructure, representing all the views on the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN">Last month, we shocked the naysayers by shepherding many of 
the subcommittee's top priorities through the full committee 
unanimously in RAY BAUM'S Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN">Today, just as that package is about to head to the 
President's desk, we've got four more bipartisan bills that 
address everything from combating illegal pirate radio to 
identifying ways technology can help prevent suicide across the 
country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN">I couldn't be more pleased with the work of members of the

    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN">Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in Tennessee,

    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Marsha Blackburn">Good morning and welcome to our second legislative hearing 
of 2018. A little less than 2 months ago, we sat here in this 
room discussing 25 pieces of legislation addressing broadband 
infrastructure representing all the views on the table. Last 
month, we shocked the naysayers by shepherding many of the 
subcommittee's top priorities through the full committee 
unanimously in RAY BAUM'S Act. Today, just as that package is 
about to head toward the President's desk, we've got four more 
bipartisan bills that address everything from combating illegal 
pirate radio to identifying ways technology can help prevent 
suicide across the country. I couldn't be more pleased with the 
work of members of the subcommittee and all the important 
initiatives we've got going on this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Marsha Blackburn">I'd also like to commend Congressman Stewart on being a

Flores, Mr. McKinley, Mr. Rush, and Mr. Tonko. Suicide is the 
10th leading cause of death in Tennessee, and this legislation

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE">    Mr. Doyle, you're recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Doyle</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Thank you, Madam Chair, for holding this
hearing, and thank you to the witnesses for appearing before us 
today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Today we are considering four pieces of legislation. In 
particular, I am happy to see before us a bill by my good 
friend Peter Welch, H.R. 2903, the Rural Reasonable and 
Comparable Wireless Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Doyle">This bipartisan legislation seeks to establish national 
standards for mobile service, mobile data service, and 
broadband services in rural America that are comparable to 
those in urban America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Doyle">I know this is an issue that my friend and colleague is 
very passionate about, and as this bill points out, under the 
Communications Act, Congress tasked the FCC with ensuring that 
rural areas had similar access and availability of service as 
their urban counterparts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Doyle">But I don't have to tell anyone here that we have fallen 
short of that goal. Get on a highway that isn't the I-95 
corridor, and wireless service gets spotty fast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Or move from Pittsburgh or DC to rural Tennessee and try to 
get fiber internet. We need to make sure that people in rural 
America can get the same kind of widespread high-speed access 
as we have in urban areas and along urban corridors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Doyle">I am proud the committee Democrats have proposed a plan 
with Ranking Member Pallone's LIFT America Act that seeks to 
close this gap with a $40 billion investment in capital 
investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Congressman Lance and I have also introduced the AIRWAVES 
Act along with a number of our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle that sets aside 10 percent of the revenue from the 
spectrum auctions set out in the bill for deployment of 
broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved 
communities in rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Another bill we have under discussion today is 
Congresswoman Bernice Johnson's National Suicide Hotline 
Improvement Act, which would require the FCC to work in 
coordination with SAMHSA to explore the feasibility of a three-
digit dialing code similar to 9-1-1 or 3-1-1 for suicide 
prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Doyle">This legislation passed by UC in the Senate, a seemingly 
rare feat these days, and I hope we can continue to move this 
important legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Doyle">We are also discussing a bill on unlicensed radio 
broadcasts today, and while I have heard anecdotes that there 
is a problem on the rise in major cities like New York and 
Miami, I am concerned that the proposed solution is to increase 
fines for these broadcasts tenfold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Years ago, I worked with Congressman Lee Terry on the Low 
Power FM Radio legislation. We saw that there was an issue of 
illegal broadcasts but also that there weren't many 
opportunities for communities around the country to express 
themselves on the air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Doyle">We sought to address this by increasing the opportunities 
available to these communities by opening a Low Power FM 
application window, which resulted in thousands of new stations 
across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Doyle">As we consider this legislation, I think we need to balance 
the legitimate concerns of broadcast licensees with the limited 
opportunities for expression available to some communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Doyle">My hope is as we consider this bill we can take an approach 
that addresses both groups' needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Doyle">And the last bill we are considering today is Congressman 
Latta's H.R. 3787, the Small Entity Regulatory Relief 
Opportunity Act.</paragraph>

    <opening>Prepared statement of Hon. Michael F. Doyle</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Michael F. Doyle">I am very concerned about this bill. The way that it is 
drafted would open up a huge regulatory hole at the FCC and 
would enable companies with over a billion dollars in revenue 
to be exempted from a wide range of rules intended to protect 
consumers and, to be honest, small businesses as well.I am very 
skeptical about the merits and need for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Michael F. Doyle">Thank you, Madam Chairman, for holding this hearing, and 
thank you to the witnesses for appearing before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Michael F. Doyle">Today we are considering four pieces of legislation. I'm 
happy that we've decided to take these up and hope that we can 
proceed with consideration of these bills under regular order.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Michael F. Doyle">While we've done an enviable job of electrifying the rural 
parts of our country, we've fallen far short in getting 
broadband not just to people's homes, but to the areas they 
live, work, and commute. Get on a highway that isn't the I-95 
corridor, and wireless service gets spotty fast. We need to 
make sure that people in rural America can get the same kind of

    <speaker>Mr. Doyle</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Doyle"> With that, Madam Chair, I want to yield the
balance of my time to my good friend and colleague, Mr. Welch.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Welch</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Welch">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Welch">You know, as we sit here today we all know that rural 
broadband infrastructure is insufficient and rural America is 
being left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Welch">The FCC, in my view, is not meeting its congressionally 
mandated goal, which is ensuring rural America has access to, 
quote, ``reasonably comparable service to their urban areas.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Welch">We basically haven't had a definition of what ``reasonably 
comparable'' is, and my bill, with Mr. McKinley, is designed to 
get at this issue and make ``reasonably comparable'' real and 
meaningful in rural America, just like electricity was when we 
made that public policy commitment in the 1930s to wire rural 
America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Welch">The FCC, under this bill, would have to gather data from 
the 20 most populous metro areas and detail the average signal 
strength and speeds of mobile voice and mobile internet 
services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Welch">It would also require the FCC to determine the extent to 
which mobile and fixed broadband service provided in rural 
areas is reasonably comparable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Welch">That's what the bill would do. It is absolutely essential 
we do that in order to be able to say yes or no, that rural 
America has reasonably comparable services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Welch">Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Ranking Member 
Doyle.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Pallone">Thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Pallone">Our hearing today will examine four bipartisan 
communication bills. Though communications is the thread that 
binds them all, they each touch on vastly different but 
important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Pallone">First, I am pleased we are considering the National Suicide 
Hotline Improvement Act of 2017, which aims to quickly connect 
individuals experiencing a mental health crisis with a 
professional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Pallone">Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death for people of 
all ages, and every year hundreds of thousands of people are 
injured in attempted suicides or other mental health 
emergencies, and this bill would require the Federal 
Communications Commission to study how to establish a 
nationwide three-digit number to access the National Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Pallone">With rates of suicide increasing each year, we must do all 
we can to get support services to those in need, and I'd like 
to thank one of our witnesses, Mr. Madigan, for all the 
important work you do at the American Foundation for Suicide 
Prevention, and thanks also for being with us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Pallone">We will also be discussing the Rural Reasonable and 
Comparable Wireless Access Act introduced by Congressmen Welch 
and McKinley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Pallone">This bill would shine a light on the quality of voice and 
broadband services offered in rural areas. It would direct the 
FCC to examine whether people in rural communities actually 
receive the same level of service as those in urban areas, and 
the FCC has talked a lot over the past year about improving 
connections in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Pallone">This bill would require the FCC to collect and analyze the 
facts on the ground and make sure that it's actually getting 
the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Pallone">I am also glad we will be discussing the problems caused by 
pirate radio broadcasters--people who broadcast illegally on 
our public airwaves. Pirate broadcasters flout the law and 
interfere with the licensed broadcasters who follow the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Pallone">These pirate broadcasts can be frustrating for people but, 
more critically, they prevent people from hearing important 
communications and public safety information in times of 
emergency, and that's simply unacceptable, and I look forward 
to hearing about ways that we can work to solve this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Pallone">And finally, we will discuss the Small Entity Regulatory 
Relief Opportunity Act. While I certainly appreciate the 
difficulties faced by small businesses across the country, I 
have concerns with the ways this bill would try to solve those 
problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Pallone">The bill would allow the FCC to roll back or delay consumer 
protections for subscribers of telecommunications and cable 
companies that serve as many as 6.5 million customers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Pallone">These supposedly small businesses could be larger than 35 
States, and many of the millions of customers of the providers 
have fewer or no choices.</paragraph>

ways to better protect the American people.</paragraph>

veterans, when they are in crisis. I am glad these commonsense 
proposals are before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. McNerney">However, I have a concern about one of the bills, the Small 
Entity Regulatory Relief Opportunity Act. While I am very open 
to finding ways to streamline compliance for small businesses, 
I am troubled by the larger trend we are witnessing of 
protections across the board being eliminated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. McNerney">I am very concerned that this bill will be another step 
backwards for consumer protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. McNerney">And with that, I'll yield back to the ranking member and to 
the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. McNerney">Mrs. Blackburn. Gentleman yields back.</paragraph>

 AFFAIRS, COMPETITIVE CARRIERS ASSOCIATION; DAVID L. DONOVAN, 
 PRESIDENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NEW YORK STATE BROADCASTERS 
 ASSOCIATION, INC.; ROBERT GESSNER, PRESIDENT, MASSILLON CABLE

 MADIGAN, JR., VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF PUBLIC POLICY OFFICER, 
 AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION; AND SARAH MORRIS, 
 DIRECTOR OF OPEN INTERNET POLICY, OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Mr. Tim Donovan. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Chairman Blackburn, Ranking Member Doyle, and members of 
the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify on 
meeting Congress' mandate for universal service and policies 
that will help close the digital divide for mobile connectivity 
between urban and rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">I am here on behalf of CCA, representing nearly 100 
wireless carriers as well as the companies that make up the 
wireless ecosystem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">All CCA members have an interest in closing the digital 
divide, and the vast majority of CCA members employ the same 
consumers that live and work in their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">I thank the subcommittee for steadfast efforts to preserve 
and expand mobile broadband nationwide. We support several 
committee initiatives included in the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, and thank the leadership, Members, and 
staff for their hard work and long hours to make that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Today, I will focus primarily on H.R. 2903, the Rural 
Reasonable and Comparable Wireless Access Act of 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">While the title is a mouthful, the underlying issue is 
critically important: making sure that rural America has the 
same opportunities as urban areas, from economic growth and 
jobs to public safety, health, and education because of access 
to robust mobile broadband services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">CCA thanks Representatives McKinley, Welch, and their nine 
bipartisan cosponsors for focusing on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Universal service is not only a good policy objective, it 
is the law. Congress was clear in its mandate to the FCC to 
ensure that all consumers have access to reasonably comparable 
services as those provided in urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">H.R. 2903 will provide important transparency into whether 
the FCC is meeting the universal service mandate or if work 
remains by having the FCC promulgate regulations to determine 
whether services available in rural areas are reasonably 
comparable to those in urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">This committee has been hard at work on addressing issues 
necessary to expand broadband and pave the way to 5G. CCA 
supports those efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">While 5G promises to support services that were once 
considered science fiction, we cannot neglect Americans living 
in areas that lack service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">We need not look far to see how H.R. 2903 will immediately 
support the FCC in its USF mission. The FCC recently released a 
map depicting areas initially deemed eligible for Mobility Fund 
phase 2 support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Because the technical parameters selected by the FCC were 
not sufficient to produce a map that reflects the experience 
you have as you travel your districts, significant portions of 
your States may not be eligible for funding through the 
mobility fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">It is now clear that standardizing data as directed in the 
House-passed Rural Wireless Access Act as part of RAY BAUM'S 
Act is not enough to produce an accurate map if the standard is 
not sufficiently calibrated to meet the goal of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Final maps for eligible areas must reflect the statute's 
call for reasonably comparable services. Further, without a set 
standard, it is not clear that resources allocated by the FCC 
are sufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Without a goal, it is not possible to set a budget. H.R. 
2903 will help guide funding levels necessary to achieve 
universal service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Other important policy decisions also rest on comparable 
service, including access to spectrum and streamlined 
deployment of infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Any evidence that rural Americans do not enjoy comparable 
services as their urban peers should reinvigorate the need for 
policymakers to take steps to support deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">For example, spectrum is a finite resource, and all 
carriers must have access to low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum 
to deploy next-generation mobile broadband, whether in urban or 
rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">It is necessary to make additional spectrum available for 
all carriers to provide rural areas with the latest services, 
and Congress should first complete the 600 megahertz repack as 
safely, swiftly, and efficiently as possible to allow winning 
bidders to put the spectrum to use to serve consumers, and 
second, auction all available millimeter wave bands as soon as 
possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">I thank Representatives Lance, Doyle, and a dozen 
bipartisan cosponsors for their leadership on setting time 
lines to auction this spectrum in the AIRWAVES Act and creating 
a fund from auction proceeds to support deployment in rural 
areas. This makes the bill a win-win for rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Carriers cannot provide comparable services without 
comparable infrastructure, and any challenges with cost delays 
or permitting are magnified in areas with sparse populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">The goals of H.R. 2903 again demonstrate how important 
efforts from the FCC and Congress are to support deployment. 
Separately, CCA appreciates H.R. 3787, sponsored by 
Representatives Latta and Schrader, also under consideration 
today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">Smaller carriers already must overcome challenges larger 
carriers take for granted, and any appropriate regulatory 
relief Congress can provide will allow them to marshal 
resources to better serve their customers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">With Congress, the FCC, and the administration all focused 
on closing the digital divide, the time to act is now, and H.R. 
2903 provides a yardstick to measure where efforts remain 
necessary to make sure that rural America is not left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="TIM DONOVAN">CCA looks forward with you to making the promise of 
reasonably comparable services a reality as access to mobile 
broadband becomes even more essential for modern life.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF DAVID L. DONOVAN</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Mr. Donovan, you're recognized for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Mr. David Donovan. On behalf of the New York State 
Broadcasters Association and along with the National 
Association of Broadcasters, I am honored to support the PIRATE 
Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Let me start by thanking Congressman Leonard Lance and 
Congressman Paul Tonko for their leadership in drafting this 
legislation. I also want to thank Congressman Chris Collins, 
who's been a leader on this issue for several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">But before I begin, I also want to thank the committee for 
their work in helping to secure repacking funding, which is in 
today's omnibus, and I truly want to thank you for all your 
work in that, and also Congressman Pallone for his work in the 
SANDy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">FCC Chairman Pai and Commissioner Mike O'Rielly have made 
pirate enforcement a priority, and I want to recognize Rosemary 
Harold, who works in the enforcement bureau, and her team for 
her efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">They were on the front lines, and their work is essential. 
But despite these efforts, it's become clear that the FCC needs 
additional tools to combat this problem, and the PIRATE Act 
provides those tools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">There are hundreds of illegal stations transmitting from 
balconies and rooftops of residential and commercial buildings 
across New York City and northern New Jersey. There are more 
illegal stations in the New York metropolitan area than there 
are legally licensed stations, and the problem is growing. It 
is spreading to Boston, it is spreading to Connecticut, and it 
is spreading throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Pirates disrupt the emergency alert system. Their 
interference prevents listeners from hearing life-saving 
information broadcast by legal stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Pirates do not participate in the EAS system. So consumers 
listening to these stations will not hear EAS messages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">But more importantly, they undermine the basic fabric of 
the entire EAS system, which is premised on one station 
monitoring another station, and so on down the line, similar to 
a row of dominoes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Pirate interference breaks this chain, which means stations 
who are relying on the EAS messages and consumers listening to 
those EAS messages will not hear them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Moreover, in the event of an emergency, whether it's local 
news or public affairs, that lifesaving information consumers 
won't hear because of pirate interference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Pirates threaten public health. Their transmitters operate 
and they threaten the health of unsuspecting citizens to RF 
frequency radiation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Let me provide you just with a few examples from our 
engineering analysis in 2016. You have slides before you, and 
they're also appearing on the board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">[The slides appear at the end of Mr. David Donovan's 
prepared statement.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">What you see before you are pictures of illegal pirate 
radio stations operating in New Jersey and in New York. But the 
critical issue here, why I want you to see these stations, is 
because none of these stations comply with FCC and Government 
RF radiation standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">They're broadcasting at power levels between 10 and 3,000 
watts, and if you look at the slides, included in there is how 
close you should be to these pirate antennas. And as a result, 
there are folks who are receiving above Government standard 
levels of RF radiation that can range from 20 to 80 feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">Now, on the last slide I will also notice it's right next 
to the East Orange, New Jersey, police station, which we found 
ironic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">But the bottom line is that, if you live in the top floors 
of these buildings or if you use a rooftop deck, you are being 
exposed to levels that are above Government standards, and this 
is occurring in communities throughout New York, throughout New 
Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">They're occurring in--we have pirates in Albany. You're 
seeing them in Connecticut. You're seeing them in Boston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">This requires, we believe, action. But pirates also 
interfere with airport communications on frequencies assigned 
to the FAA, creating an extremely dangerous situation. They 
ignore all consumer protections laws, whether it's sponsorship 
ID laws, indecency, public file requirements, alcohol and 
tobacco advertising laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">They have absolutely flouted all FCC political rules and 
regulations. Whether it's access to candidates, equal time, all 
the rules that have been set down by the Federal Communications 
Commission are flatly ignored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">The PIRATE Act solves this problem. It gives the FCC 
additional tools. It significantly increases the fines for 
operating an illegal station. It clarifies existing law with 
regarding to liability for those who facilitate pirates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">It also provides working with State laws and recognizes 
those State laws, and it streamlines the FCC's enforcement 
process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">In conclusion, in 2015, 33 Members of Congress asked the 
FCC to increase its pirate radio enforcement. The FCC under 
Chairman Pai have done that. But they need more tools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="DAVID L. DONOVAN">The fundamental purpose of the FCC is to manage the 
spectrum and avoid interference.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF ROBERT GESSNER</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ROBERT GESSNER">    Mr. Gessner, 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gessner</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Good morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Chairman Blackburn, Ranking Member Doyle, members of the 
subcommittee, my name is Robert Gessner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Gessner">I am president of Massillon Cable TV, a small family-owned 
broadband and cable company serving 50,000 customers in five 
Ohio counties. Mostly, really nervous, as this is my first time 
testifying in any sort of venue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Gessner">I also currently serve as chairman of the American Cable 
Association, which represents more than 700 small and mid-size 
companies, a mixture of municipalities, telephone companies, 
electric companies, rural co-ops, as well as cable TV 
operators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Gessner">The majority of ACA members have fewer than 1,000 
customers, fewer than 10 employees, and almost none have an 
attorney on staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Despite our small size, we make large investments in our 
networks to provide critical connectivity to the communities we 
serve--typically, rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Gessner">And I thank you for inviting me to testify about H.R. 3787, 
the Small Entity Regulatory Relief Opportunity Act, or SERRO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Gessner">SERRO is a narrowly tailored bipartisan bill whose purpose 
is to streamline the process by which deserving small 
communications entities may request--and I stress that word 
request, regulatory relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Many regulations at the FCC are one-size-fits-all. Because 
of our limited size, small entities often are not the source of 
the specific harms that the FCC is targeting. Now, in theory, 
the FCC waiver process gives small entities an opportunity to 
show good cause for an exemption or a delay in the application 
of a one-size-fits-all rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Gessner">But, in practice, deserving small entities often are 
deterred from seeking relief because of the administrative 
costs and the uncertainty of the waiver process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Gessner">To give you just one example, in 2010, my company, which 
had recently converted to an all-digital platform, went to 
considerable expense to petition the FCC for a waiver of 
certain analog-based technical performance testing 
requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Gessner">It was not until last September, more than 7 years after we 
filed our waiver request, that the FCC finally addressed our 
concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Now, the goal of SERRO is to ensure that the FCC is more 
attentive to small entities' well-founded need for exceptions 
to or relief from one-size-fits-all rules and it accomplishes 
that in three provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Gessner">First, SERRO directs the FCC to adopt streamlined 
provisions to reduce the administrative burdens faced by small 
entities that file waiver petitions and to expedite the 
resolution of those petitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Second, SERRO clarifies that Congress intends for the FCC, 
as part of its mandated triennial review process to consider 
the impact of its rules on any and all small entities within 
its jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Gessner">SERRO further instructs the FCC to modify or repeal the 
application of particular regulations to small entities where 
the commission determines there is good cause to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Gessner">And third, SERRO establishes an automatic referral period 
of at least 1 year in the application of most new regulations 
to small entities, subject to exceptions for rules that address 
public safety concerns or that reduce waste, fraud, and abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Gessner">If SERRO had been in place in 2010, my company would not 
have been subjected to 7 years of regulatory uncertainty, 
waiting for the FCC to act on our petition. In fact, we might 
not have needed to go to the expense of filing the petition in 
the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Gessner">I want to stress that SERRO is focused only on the 
procedures by which small entities can request regulatory 
relief. That's the O in SERRO--an opportunity. Nothing in the 
bill would change the substantive legal standard for obtaining 
that relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Gessner">And I also want to emphasize that while I am here 
representing the American Cable Association, SERRO is not a 
cable-only bill. SERRO will apply to and has the support of 
small entities in every sector of the communications industry, 
as evidenced by this letter that was sent to Chairman Walden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Now, in conclusion, I do want to express my thanks to 
Representatives Latta and the absent Mr. Schrader to move SERRO 
forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Gessner">As Representative Latta stated in this introduction, while 
small businesses are the engines of the economy, generating two 
out of three new jobs, they also are the most susceptible to 
burdensome regulations that harm their ability to grown, 
expand, and hire new employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Gessner">ACA looks forward to working with you on this sensible and 
important piece of bipartisan procedural regulatory relief 
legislation and be happy to answer any questions.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF JOHN H. MADIGAN, JR.</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="JOHN H. MADIGAN">    Mr. Madigan, 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Madam Chairman and Ranking Member Doyle, thank
you very much for inviting the American Foundation for Suicide 
Prevention to testify this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Madigan">My name is John Madigan. I have the honor and privilege of 
being the association's chief public policy officer. We are a 
nonprofit health agency about 30 years old and we are organized 
in all 50 States, and I believe my team has provided all 
members of the subcommittee with fact sheets that illustrate 
the suicide issue in your particular State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Madigan">I am also here to testify about H.R. 2345, the National 
Suicide Prevention Hotline Improvement Act of 2017. We want to 
thank, obviously, Representative Chris Stewart from Utah and 
Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson from Texas for her 
leadership on this important issue, and the other cosponsors in 
the House, which is somewhere around seven cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Let me speak frankly. Suicide is now the tenth leading 
cause of death in our country for adults age 18 to 64. For 
every one suicide, there are 25 suicide attempts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Madigan">The annual age-adjusted suicide rate is 13.42 per 100,000 
individuals. After adjusting for differences in age and sex, 
risk for suicide is 19 percent higher for male veterans than 
for U.S. non-veteran male adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Risk is 2.5 times higher among female veterans when 
compared to U.S. non-veteran women. Men die by suicide three 
and a half times more than women and white males account for 
seven out of 10 deaths in 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Suicide is often the result of unrecognized and untreated 
mental illness. Get this. One in four Americans have a 
diagnosable mental illness but only one in five are seeking 
professional help for this condition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Suicide tends to be the highest when multiple risk factors 
or precipitating events occur in an individual with mental 
illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Despite public perception, most people with mental illness 
do not die by suicide. Mental illnesses such as depression, 
bipolar disorder, alcohol and drug dependence, post-traumatic 
stress, and traumatic brain injury may create the underlying 
risk that, when combined with life stressors such as transition 
from military life, job loss, relationship, financial, or legal 
problems increase risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Madigan">There's good news. There's a grass roots movement that's 
now being formed, like it has for many other disease groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Our movement is being catalyzed by both survivors of 
suicide loss--I lost my younger sister, Nancy, 21 years ago 
when she was 37--and also the emerging voices of those that 
have what we call the lived experience--those people who have 
survived their own suicide attempts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Madigan">So as I said earlier, I am here today to talk about why 
H.R. 2345 could be a game changer for our national public 
safety net. It was discussed by Chairman Pallone. Essentially, 
the FCC is going to look into the possibility of converting the 
1-800-273-TALK number into an easy-to-remember three-digit 
number like 9-1-1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Madigan">It will require SAMHSA to study the effectiveness of the 
current system and also to assess how veterans are being helped 
in this system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Finally, the study will provide cost estimates and resource 
needs for increasing Federal support for phone hotline, chat, 
and text.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Madigan">To hear some important facts, a national easy-to-remember 
single point of access free, anonymous, and toll-free for all 
American residents is necessary to provide a health safety net 
for all persons in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Madigan">The experience of SAMHSA's national suicide prevention 
lifeline indicates that a national hotline number has been 
essential in addressing this public health crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Since 2005, the lifeline has served more than 11 million 
callers. In 2017, the national network answered 2 million 
calls. According to independent evaluators of the service, 75 
percent are non-suicidal and 25 percent are suicidal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Madigan">So the bottom line, in closing, is that this legislation is 
critically important. When my 25-year-old daughter texted me 
this morning and asked me, ``Daddy, why are you testifying 
before the Communications and Technology Subcommittee?'' I 
said, ``Preventing suicide is all about communication, and in 
the 21st century it's all about technology.''</paragraph>

Doyle, and subcommittee members for the opportunity to testify 
today at this legislative hearing on four communications bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Morris">My name is Sarah Morris and I represent New America's Open 
Technology Institute, or OTI, where I am the director of open 
internet policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Morris">New America is a nonpartisan nonprofit civic enterprise 
dedicated to the renewal of American politics, prosperity, and 
purpose in the digital age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Morris">OTI is a program within New America that works at the 
intersection of technology and policy to ensure that every 
community has equitable access to digital technology and its 
benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Morris">OTI promotes universal access to communications 
technologies that are both open and secure, using a multi-
disciplinary approach that brings together advocates, 
researchers, organizers, and innovators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Morris">Our primary focus areas include net neutrality, broadband 
access and adoption, surveillance and security, and consumer 
privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Morris">My testimony will focus on concerns related to one of the 
four bills under consideration today: H.R. 3787, or the Small 
Entity Regulatory Relief Act, which I will refer to as SERRO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Morris">OTI's concerns are fourfold. First, it is not clear that an 
immediate problems exists that this bill would effectively 
solve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Morris">Indeed, against the backdrop of the current heavily 
deregulated landscape, the proposed bill seems particularly 
unnecessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Morris">Second, to the extent that a need for waivers from or 
exemptions to certain regulations exist, numerous processes for 
securing them also already exist at the Federal Communications 
Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Morris">Third, the definition of small entities in the bill is 
unclear. Finally, the proposed triennial review process reforms 
would create a high degree of confusion and uncertainty at the 
commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Morris">I've submitted a detailed written testimony to the 
subcommittee already and I will use my time here to briefly 
explain each of those four concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Morris">Regulations of general applicability are the standard in 
Federal regulatory policy making, and for a good reason. The 
point of consumer protection laws, from telecommunications to 
food service to health care, is to protect all consumers from 
harmful practices, not just consumers of the biggest entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Morris">All consumers are entitled to the protections of Federal 
telecommunications laws. There may be instances where waivers 
from certain regulations under the Communication Act are 
appropriate. As I will discuss shortly, there are mechanisms 
for addressing the need for specific waivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Morris">However, neither Mr. Gessner nor the bill's cosponsors have 
demonstrated widespread and significant harms that would be 
most effectively remedied by the reforms proposed in SERRO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Morris">It is unclear why the triple play proposed in the bill, an 
expedited waiver application process, a near blanket exemption 
from all future regulations for a period of 1 year and an 
expanded triennial review of the applicability of all 
regulations to small entities as necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Morris">Indeed, the commission already provides numerous avenues of 
recourse for a small business that believes an existing or 
proposed regulation is unduly burdensome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Morris">The most obvious and fundamental opportunity to discuss 
burdens on small businesses is to engage with the commission 
during the notice and comment periods that are required each 
time new rules are created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Morris">In those proceedings, the commission has opportunities to 
hear from multiple perspectives on the parties' assertion of 
burdens and can appropriately weigh those burdens with the need 
for the regulations in question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Morris">In addition, as the bill itself acknowledges, the 
commission's rules already allow the commission to waive 
specific requirements of the rules on its own motion or upon 
request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Morris">The best approach for ensuring certainty and reducing 
administrative burdens is to use existing processes to identify 
the need for a narrow waivers when a need for such a waiver is 
clearly demonstrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Morris">This bill, however, uses an arbitrary definition of small 
entity that creates considerable confusion and shifts the 
burden of the defending the applicability of a given regulation 
onto consumer groups and other parties every single time a 
regulation is considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Morris">Not only is this a significant administrative cost to bear 
on its face, the problem is compounded by the fact that the 2 
percent market share threshold will need to be defined every 
single time a regulation is considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. Morris">As we have seen in antitrust analysis, this type of market 
share definition is entirely dependent on how a given market is 
defined. As telecom industries become more integrated and 
services evolve, defining relevant market could become even 
more difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Morris">Finally, the modifications to the 257 triennial review 
requirement proposed in this bill could create significant 
administrative burdens for consumer groups and other parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Morris">As written, the amendments to 257 would allow the 
commission to, once the bill is enacted, re-litigate every 
single regulation currently on the books at the commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Morris">This reevaluation would require multiple proceedings to be 
reopened and create enormous bureaucratic strain throughout the 
communications part as well as uncertainty for consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. Morris">Each of the three proposals in SERRO raise concerns. Taken 
together, however, they represent a fundamental shift in 
burdens and advocacy before the Federal Communications 
Commission.</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Ms. Morris follows:][GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Ms. Morris ">I urge the subcommittee to reject H.R. 3787.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Morris ">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentlelady concludes her statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Morris ">At this time, that concludes all of our opening statements. 
We are going to move to questions. I do want everyone to be 
mindful--it looks like 12:15 to 12:30 will be the next vote 
series, and I want to move through as many of these questions 
as we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Morris ">    So, Mr. Shimkus, I will begin with you. You're recognized 
for 5 minutes for questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Shimkus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">Madam Chair, thank you. You're very kind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">Let me--let me go to Tim, and I want to ask Mr. Gessner 
this question, because I've just been wrestling with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">So we want competition. We want deployment. You're in the 
rural areas--very difficult. You're trying to get 5G in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">I keep hearing from my local municipalities the concern 
that their input as to siting for 5G--they're not going to--you 
know, they'll weave a story. We've got this great park. We 
don't want a refrigerator-sized 5G sitting in there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">So talk me through this on competition 5G and how do we 
make sure that the concerns of local communities are still, at 
least, listened to?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">Because a lot of this is these regulatory burdens get it 
moved, right?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">Mr. Tim Donovan. Thank you, Congressman, and you're 
probably also hearing from them about how they want to be one 
of the first smart cities and want to make sure that all of 
your constituents are able to connect to the latest services. 
So you do need to have the infrastructure to provide that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">We are working together with ways to look at it not as a 
zero sum gain but how can we make the application process both 
easier for carriers for deploying this as well as reduce the 
resources needed by municipalities to review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">    If there's some low-hanging fruit of places that make sense 
to streamline the review then that also means one less 
application--a couple less hours that somebody who works for 
the municipality has to spend reviewing that application.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Shimkus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">So, Mr. Gessner, obviously, from the rural
cable perspective, there also could be, you know, debates. You 
have already done negotiations with local communities on right-
of-ways and wires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">And talk to me about the competitive pressure or what would 
be the response as there is a great desire to also move 5G in 
the areas and the local communities have been able to--the old 
historic models--what, the historic model is the cable company 
comes in, they negotiate, there's fees, they work with the 
local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">5G could disrupt the way this paradigm has been 
established. But a lot of us want the competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">    So can you talk through that, from your perspective?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gessner</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Good question. We haven't had a great deal of
interaction between the 5G proponents and traditional cable 
companies, at least not in our size markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Gessner">We look forward, actually, to working with the 5G operators 
because we know they're going to need a lot of back haul. When 
you have got a 5G transmitter every few hundred feet, it has to 
connect to something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Gessner">    So companies like mine are certainly prepared to work with 
them through our high-capacity fiber networks to bring all of 
that 5G data back without having to have more repeater towers 
and that sort of thing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Shimkus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">Great. And I was going to spend time asking
you to talk about some of the other challenges and problems you 
have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">But in lieu of the time, Madam Chair and everybody else 
wants to ask questions. I yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Shimkus">    Mr. Doyle, 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Doyle</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Congress created an 
independent office of advocacy within the Small Business 
Administration, and the job of that office is to go out and 
advocate before Congress, the White House, and Federal agencies 
on behalf of small businesses in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Doyle">The Office of Advocacy has come on against regulation that 
harms small businesses like the FCC's order to deregulate 
business data services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Much like the FCC's rollback of business data protections, 
I am worried that this small entity bill would actually hurt 
small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Doyle">    I want to ask you, Ms. Morris, do you believe that H.R. 
3787 could unfairly disadvantage some small businesses over 
others?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Morris">Sure. I thank you, Ranking Member, for the
question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. Morris">And I certainly think that there is a high risk of harm to 
all types of entities, whether it's consumers, other small--and 
consumers can include small businesses that are purchasing 
broadband from an entity that would be covered by this act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Morris">In the case of the net neutrality protections where a 
waiver was granted for certain parts of the rules, a more 
automatic and sweeping waiver in that case would have resulted 
in many small businesses that rely on an open internet access 
to be harmed by the lack of that access in certain instances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Morris">    We want all consumers to have access to the protections 
afforded by the commission, not just those of the largest 
entities.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Doyle</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Doyle">So let me ask you, under this bill, the
threshold for expedited small business relief is set at 2 
percent or fewer of the consumers receiving such subscription 
service in the United States. It seems like a vague standard 
but also a rather overly inclusive one as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Doyle">In the video market, for example, 2 percent of the market 
would be over 1.6 million customers, and when you look at a 
couple of companies that fall into that range, they have annual 
revenues of over $1.5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Doyle">    That doesn't seem like a small business to me. Does that 
seem small to you? And what effect would exempting these 
companies from the FCC's rules have on consumers?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Ms. Morris"> We certainly agree that the definition is both
unclear and potentially much too large and as you point out, 
Ranking Member Doyle, this--implementation of this bill has the 
potential to remove protections for millions of Americans 
across the country--protections that the FCC would have 
otherwise be deemed necessary in a thorough rulemaking process.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Doyle</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Yes. I think more to the point, the FCC
interacts with a wide range of small businesses from radio and 
TV stations, voice video, data providers, device manufacturers, 
wireless licensees, and many of the FCC's rules that these 
businesses comply with are not only tailored to the size of 
those businesses but also to ensuring that these entities 
uphold their obligations under the Communications Acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Doyle">    So what effect would granting these wide-ranging waivers 
have on industry sectors under the FCC's jurisdiction?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Ms. Morris">We think it would create a significant
uncertainty as we try to figure out which application--which 
regulations apply to which entities--which ones apply to 
other--or don't apply to other entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Ms. Morris">    And meanwhile, I will just repeat that consumers in those 
industries will be harmed in the process when those protections 
don't apply to their providers.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Doyle</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Madam Chair, in the interest of time, I yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Doyle">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Doyle">    Mr. Lance, 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lance</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Lance">Thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Lance">To the distinguished panel, thank you all for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Lance">Mr. Donovan, can you comment on some of the limitations of 
the FCC's current enforcement tools against pirate radios? Have 
you seen issues with the commission's ability to shut down 
pirates in your role as president of New York Broadcasters?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Lance">Mr. David Donovan. Thank you, Congressman Lance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Lance">Yes. I think that there is some limitations and those 
limitations now are based on the statute. Let me give you some 
examples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Lance">Under the Communications Act, the fine, for example, for an 
entity not licensed by the FCC is, roughly, $10,000. Pirate 
radio operators--this is big business, and a $10,000 fine is 
absolutely nothing. When you actually look at someone who's 
been violating the law literally for decades, this is just a 
cost of doing business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Lance">The second piece is is that in order to get a seizure order 
or an order to enforce the fine, the FCC is required to go 
through the--through the U.S. attorney's office. They are busy 
on things like terrorism, drug interdiction, and this becomes 
the fourth level issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Lance">What I think--and I worked at the commission for 10 years--
I think what we really need to do is to give the FCC the 
authority to go to court to defend its own orders and also to 
get seizure orders as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Lance">    The FCC currently has the authority to go to the U.S. Court 
of Appeals to defend its orders at the appellate level. It 
seemed it would make sense to get rid of the number one issue, 
which is would love to help you but the U.S. Attorneys Office 
just isn't interested.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lance</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Lance">Thank you. I am working on this issue, as you
know, and the PIRATE Act and I want to continue to work with 
you and the other distinguished members of the panel, and I 
certainly agree with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Lance">And Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to submit the New 
York Broadcasters' report on pirate radio into the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Lance">Mrs. Blackburn. Without objection.\1\

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lance</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Lance">Thank you, and I yield back 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Lance">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Lance">    Ms. Matsui, you are recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Matsui</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Since its creation in 2004, the Spectrum Relocation Fund 
has become a critical tool for Federal agencies relocating or 
sharing spectrum for wireless broadband use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. Matsui">In 2015, Congress made improvements to the SRF that allowed 
agencies to use funds in SRF to support engineering research 
that could lead to the repurposing of spectrum for commercial 
use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Matsui">The improvements have worked. Last month, NTIA and DOD 
identified 100 megahertz of spectrum that could potentially be 
repurposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. Matsui">However, current law limits how much of existing SRF funds 
can be used for this research and related activities. This has 
created an unintended situation that could prevent agencies 
from accessing existing SRF funds and potentially prevent more 
spectrum entering the commercial marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Matsui">I am working on legislation called the Spectrum Now Act to 
address this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Mr. Donovan--Tim--would you support this effort to ensure 
that we are maximizing the amount of spectrum that could be 
repurposed for wireless broadband use?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Mr. Tim Donovan. Thank you, Congresswoman, and thank you 
for your leadership on these efforts. I think you are--it's a 
proven case model that it works and working with spectrum 
relocation fund to reallocate Federal spectrum for commercial 
use, your leadership on that issue led to the single highest 
grossing spectrum auction ever in the AWS-3 auction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. Matsui">    So this money is clearly well spent. We absolutely support 
your efforts to continue that. You know, spectrum is something 
that we are not making any more of it. So if we can be more 
efficient then that research is money well spent.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Matsui</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. Matsui">To successfully expand broadband access to the rural and 
remote areas of this country, broadband maps must accurately 
identify where service is and where it isn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. Matsui">One of the most effective ways to get better maps is by 
collecting better standardized coverage data. I understand that 
a consensus proposal to get better mobile wireless coverage 
data was put forward as part of the Mobility Fund II Challenge 
Process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Specifically, that proposal suggested modelling 4G LTE 
coverage at download speeds of 5 megahertz per second at a 90 
percent cell edge probability under cell loading factor of 50 
percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Mr. Donovan--Tim again--how can accurately modelling mobile 
broadband data help expand coverage?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Mr. Tim Donovan. Thank you, and this has been an important 
issue going on, on making sure that we know where there is 
service and where there isn't so that we can direct funding 
where it's appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. Matsui">One thing that is missing from that model that is included 
in Congressman McKinley and Congressman Walters' bill is also 
looking at signal strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. Matsui">And while it gets technical quickly, it's important. We 
measure signal strength in decibel milliwatt loss, but a 
difference of only five leads to a difference of about a 100 
percent geographic coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Ms. Matsui">    In rural areas a difference of 10 we've developed 300 
percent geographic coverage. When you look at that, you know, 
while there was consensus to move forward before, the factors 
selected by the FCC produced this map that we now know from 
looking at it that it doesn't pass the test that you all know 
from your travels across your States that it's not the 
experience that your consumers are receiving.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Matsui</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. Matsui">OK. Well, thank you very much, and I yield back
the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. Matsui">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentlelady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. Matsui">    Mr. Latta, you're recognized for five.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Latta">Well, thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Latta">And Mr. Gessner, when I travel around my district and meet 
with a lot of my business owners, especially the smaller 
business owners, they talk about the over regulations 
occurring, especially on the Federal side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Latta">And then also how that regulation affects your business and 
also a lot of times as legislators and then the regulators they 
don't really see the after effect of what happens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Latta">    And I was wondering if you might be able to look, as a 
small business owner and also in telecommunications, if you can 
thing of some real-world examples where SERRO could have helped 
your business and, consequently, your customers.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gessner</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Thank you for the question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Gessner">I offered a brief explanation of my situation in 2010 
during my testimony. I will expand on it a little bit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Gessner">We converted from an analog cable system to an all-digital 
system in 2010. We thought that was the right thing to do. We 
were well before everybody else and we went along with the 
broadcasters at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Shortly thereafter, we realized that we could no longer 
complete analog testing as required by the FCC because we had 
no analog signals to test.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Gessner">So we requested a waiver from analog testing and it was 
supposed to--should have been very, very easy because there had 
already been one operator who had received a waiver from analog 
testing. So we thought just give me one of those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Gessner">So we went to the expense. We went to the time. Produced 
the affidavits and all that sort of thing, and there were 
several, maybe a half dozen of us, who were doing the same 
thing at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Radio silence. We didn't hear anything for 7 years, and 
what finally happened was the FCC changed the rules and told 
all of us that our petitions were moved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Gessner">    Now, if SERRO had been in effect then, we could have been 
those 7 years of regulatory uncertainty. If SERRO had been in 
place then, the FCC would have been through at least two 
triennial reviews and had recognized that analog testing by 
digital systems was something that had to be addressed and they 
could have addressed it and no waivers would have been--no 
waiver petitions would have been required in the first place.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Latta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Latta">Well, thank you very much, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Latta">And I will yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Latta">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Latta">    Ms. Eshoo, you're recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Eshoo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and thank you to
each of the witnesses. It's good to see you, and I think that 
you all did a good job in presenting what you want to present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">To Ms. Morris, in your written testimony you noted that the 
small entity bill, 3787, is vague in its definition of a small 
entity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">Now, some entities may have very few subscribers, in the 
thousands. But the language also applies to companies with 
millions of subscribers, and I wouldn't consider millions of 
subscribers as small.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">If this were to become law, well, first of all, I think 
it's an ambiguous definition, obviously, because millions is 
not small.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">    So if this were to become law, what's the outcome of this? 
What would actually take place?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Ms. Morris">Thank you, Congresswoman Eshoo. I appreciate
the question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Ms. Morris">And on this issue of the definition of small entities, I 
would note that the bill may seem like it clearly and cleanly 
defines what a small entity is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Ms. Morris">But it creates worry that gamesmanship could be used to 
sort of water down the definition and that that can change over 
time and be very costly and complicated to determine on a 
recurring basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Ms. Morris">    And because, as you point out, that the range of potential 
entities covered in the definition is so expansive, as I noted 
earlier, we risk disenfranchising millions of consumers from 
the important consumer protections that the commission 
determines that they need once they're in----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Eshoo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. Eshoo"> Because tied to this are what you just
described, correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Ms. Morris">Yes. Essentially, what this bill would do would
be every time the commission makes a determination that a 
regulation is needed at a general level, what would be 
otherwise a regulation of general applicability that there 
would be essentially an automatic waiver for a year's time for 
small entities as defined, broadly, in the act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Ms. Morris">    And so for that period of time those customers and 
consumers would be--would not have access to the protections 
afforded to those who were customers of larger companies.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Eshoo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">I think that this is an area of this bill that
really needs to be tightened up because otherwise it can swing 
one way or another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">One way it could be determined that small is in the 
thousands and waivers can be granted for those that have 
millions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">It just doesn't--it would have been better if they just 
said ``waive everything,'' because that seems to be the intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">In your testimony, you also said, quote, ``the point of 
consumer protection laws is to protect consumers from all 
harmful practices, not just those from the biggest entities.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">It seems to me that this is a Trojan Horse, because it's 
going to hamstring the FCC's ability to do the job that's been 
laid out relative to the protection of consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">Again, small companies would not have to play by the rules 
that everyone else has to play by in terms of the--how it's 
defined or not defined in the language of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">    Can you describe if there's an alternative to burden? Is 
there significant consumer risk there as well?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Ms. Morris">I am sorry. If there's an alternative burden--
if a new burden is placed on--I think that, you know, there is 
the sort of immediate risk of the what happens when the 1-year 
waiver is in place. I think that there is also a concern that 
this will just overly complicate rulemaking processes at the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. Morris">    We are going to have to pre-litigate what counts as a small 
entity in every proceeding. We'll probably have to litigate 
after the fact as well, and meanwhile there will be less focus 
on the--making sure that we get the rules right so that they 
don't create the types of situations that----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Eshoo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">Well, I think that there is always a legitimate
case to be made for streamlining. But I think that this is 
going to turn into a hairball. I really do. And I would just 
suggest to the authors that they tighten up the language 
because the definition is so wide a Peterbilt truck can drive 
through it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">Mrs. Blackburn. All right. The lady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">And if everyone, I am told, can try to keep it 3 minutes or 
less, we should be able to dismiss our panel before we go for 
votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. Eshoo">    Mr. Olson, you're recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Olson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Olson">I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Olson">Welcome to our five witnesses. My comments and questions 
are for you, Mr. Madigan, on suicide and H.R. 2345.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Olson">Like you, suicide has hit me directly as a Congressman and 
even in my family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Olson">In 2014, a Marine veteran, Casey Owens, killed himself in 
Colorado. He was 32 years old. I met Casey in 2007 in our 
hometown of Sugarland, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Olson">He had lost both legs. PTSD, TBI--when a small Humvee hit a 
tank mine, the thing flew up 30 feet in the air. He found peace 
in Colorado, snow skiing. He was a competitive monoskier. His 
goal was to ski for our country in the Paralympics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Olson">But he never found true piece. He was on CBS News in 2012 
and he responded this way, quote, ``I really don't think I will 
ever be free. I don't think the burden of war is ever gone,'' 
end quote. And, sadly, it wasn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Olson">And now my family. When I was in high school, my mom got a 
master's in family therapy for kids. She met a little girl 
named Sherri Silvas at the Harris County Youth Village.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Olson">Sherri had been abused by her father. Her mom was 
worthless. She was in the gangs, drugs, and she also had a 
natural chemical imbalance. All those came together to make her 
regularly think about committing suicide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Olson">Mom became very close to Sherri. In fact, she became a de 
facto fourth child in my family. But she was a handful. She 
disappeared for three months. My dad found her halfway across 
the country. He brought her back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Olson">But 2 years after that, Sherri took her own life, as well. 
My mom, my dad, and my entire family are still haunted we 
couldn't stop her from taking her own life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Olson">And in your written testimony you said that having a verbal 
counselor--a line to call a person--is so effective that it 
actually reduces suicides and their feelings of hopelessness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Olson">    Would that have helped Sherri, and how important is that 
number to have, that 3-1-1 number?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Well, Congressman, first of all, I am sorry
for all of your experiences, and I hope you find some closure 
and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Madigan">And I think the legislation that we are looking at today is 
one piece of the puzzle in that, the data that we have, 25 
percent of the callers have some suicidal ideation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Madigan">So they do get immediate help in terms of talking out what 
is currently going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Clearly, with veterans, there's a whole host of--as I 
described in my oral statement but more detailed in my written 
statement--the life stressors that then set off a preexisting 
mental health condition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Madigan">So that's the bottom line, is that we, as a nation, need to 
more quickly recognize someone's mental illness situation, much 
like you would someone having a diabetic attack or having heart 
disease, and then--I love to talk about the face when you go 
ask a 5-year-old, you know, what's the biggest organ in the 
body and they normally say the heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Madigan">And I say, well, wrong--the biggest organ in the body is 
the brain. And if your heart is broken, you gp to the heart 
doctor to get it fixed. If your brain is broken, you need to go 
to the brain doctor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Madigan">    So it's part of that process, and we believe a three-digit 
number would make access for counseling more readily available.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Olson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Olson">Yes, and hopefully DOD can use that three-digit
number, because there has been a report by JO that says, hey, 
you guys were overwhelmed by some calls--people aren't getting 
the therapy they need via phone call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Olson">    So hopefully this helps them, gives them a chance to get to 
guys like Casey.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Madigan"> Yes. The phone calls from this January to now
versus January last year have increased 60 percent. So the need 
is clearly there, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Olson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Olson">I am sorry for your loss as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Olson">Madam Chairman, I yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Olson">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Olson">    Mr. McNerney, you're recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McNerney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. McNerney">I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. McNerney">As I mentioned earlier in my opening statement, I am 
concerned about the larger trend we are seeing with consumer 
protections across the board being eliminated from my 
constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. McNerney">    Ms. Morris, what protections do consumers currently have 
with respect to their online privacy and the information that 
is shared with their broadband provider?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Ms. Morris"> None. None from the Federal Communications
Commission. They were repealed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McNerney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. McNerney"> OK. What protections do consumers have with
respect to their broadband provider keeping their data secure?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Ms. Morris"> I do less data security work. But I would
imagine very little, because the work I did was in the 
broadband privacy.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McNerney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. McNerney"> OK. Well, what about with respect to
consumers' access to information being--online being throttled 
or blocked? Will there soon be any protections left for 
consumers from blocking and throttling?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Ms. Morris"> Once the 2017 December order takes effect, no.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McNerney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. McNerney">Well, I am certainly open to finding ways to
streamlining regulatory compliance for small business but I am 
worried that the SERRO bill would move us further in the 
direction of eliminating safeguards for consumers, many of 
which have already been eliminated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. McNerney">    Ms. Morris, in your written testimony you stated that 
triennial review process would create a high degree of 
confusion and possibly legal uncertainty at the commission. Can 
you explain how a high degree of confusion at the commission is 
likely to impact consumers?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Ms. Morris">Sure. And what I mean by that is that once the
bill would take effect there is this--every 3 years the 
triennial review but there's also the initial review when it 
seems like it would be essentially open season on any 
regulations in the FCC's currently on the books. There's no 
sort of limitation. It would be a retroactive review as part 
of--I can tell from the text of their bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Ms. Morris">    So that would mean that what small protections remain for 
consumers in this deregulatory environment at the commission 
would be under scrutiny once again, presumably with new 
proceedings open to reconsider the application of all those 
regulations, which could tie up the commission's hands for 
months or years on end.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McNerney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. McNerney">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. McNerney">Mr. Madigan, in written testimony your organization 
submitted it was noted that veterans, in particular male 
veterans, are more often at risk of suicide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. McNerney">    In my experience serving in the Veterans Affairs Committee 
I found that veterans sometimes feel isolated when they return 
home. Do you think that's one of the contributing factors?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Madigan"> Absolutely. Isolation, alcohol, access to
guns--I mean, all those kinds of things are something that 
contribute to veterans contemplating suicide.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McNerney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. McNerney"> Do you think that making sure veterans have
access to 21st century infrastructure like broadband could help 
our veterans?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Madigan"> Well, as I said at the closing of my oral
statement, I think yes, communication is the key. Talking about 
mental health issues like any other health issue and if 
technology can be increased and broadened I believe that's--our 
organization believes that's the way to go.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McNerney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. McNerney">Good. And I thank the Chair, and I will yield
back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. McNerney">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. McNerney">Mr. Bilirakis, and I remind everyone if we can keep it to 3 
minutes, then we'll probably be able to gavel out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. McNerney">    Mr. Bilirakis, you're recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilirakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">Thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">Mr. Madigan, as vice chairman of the Veterans Affairs 
Committee, the full committee, I know the veterans are a 
uniquely situated population and their experiences and 
challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">The last OIG report on the veterans crisis line identified 
a number of problems, including a considerable volume of calls 
going to voicemail, which is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">Since some time has passed since then, I agree with the 
intent of H.R. 2345 to study how the needs of veterans are 
addressed by the National Suicide Prevention Hotline--the 
lifeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">In your testimony, you say that one in three callers to the 
suicide hotline are veterans or members of the military 
families because they suffer as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">Can you explain the unique challenges that these callers 
face and in your position have you seen specific issues related 
to a call responder's ability to address these needs through 
the hotline?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">    In other words, also if some of the responders--are the 
veterans? Can they identify with the veteran?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Yes, that's a great question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Madigan">When you call 1-800-273-TALK and press 1, you're 
immediately handed over to a peer-to-peer counseling service 
where veterans who have been through the same experiences that 
most callers have been through are there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Madigan">    So I think it's an awesome program. The budget needs to be 
increased. The number of counselors need to be increased and, 
clearly, with the fact that, sir, that we lose anywhere from 18 
to 22 veterans a day that we know of----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilirakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"> That we know of. Exactly. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Madigan">That we know of--that's a major problem. So we
are committed. Again, that's why we support this legislation, 
to look at the whole picture, see what's working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Madigan">    But the bottom line, when Orrin Hatch called me last May to 
talk about this bill, I said, Senator, it's a great idea, but 
if you make it easier to call and there's no one there on the 
other end to answer the call or they're not competent to answer 
the call then that's a big problem.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilirakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"> So a veteran can speak--a combat veteran can
speak to a combat veteran. Is that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Madigan"> Absolutely. Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilirakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"> Was in a similar situation?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Madigan"> More and more any of the veteran hotlines that
I am aware of employ peer-to-peer counsellors.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilirakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"> OK. I would like to speak with you on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Yes. I will also tell you about something.
Let's talk offline about the--that's for warriors out of New 
Jersey, which is Rutgers University sponsors it and it's 
upstream counselling of veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Madigan">    So before someone gets to a bridge or puts a gun in their 
mouth, it helps veterans when they might lose their home, 
they're having personal problems or financial problems.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilirakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis"> OK. I am going stick with the 3 minutes. But
the three-digit number is obviously more--it's easier to 
remember----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Madigan">Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Madigan">    Mr. Bilirakis [continuing]. As opposed to the 1-800 number.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Madigan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Madigan">It's 1-800-273-TALK, but I imagine, you're in
the middle of a suicidal ideation, unless it's written 
somewhere, it's hard to remember.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Madigan">    So I even think a 5-year-old knows to dial 9-1-1 when they 
need to call the police, and we also think that having a 
dedicated number like 3-1-1 or whatever it might be would 
reduce the burden on 9-1-1 and get people to the right location 
the first time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilirakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">Agreed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">Thank you. I yield back, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">Mrs. Blackburn. Gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Bilirakis">    Mr. Engel, you're recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Engel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Engel">Thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Engel">Mr. David Donovan, nice to see New Yorkers here. Welcome to 
Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Engel">I am interested in the enforcement requirements of the 
PIRATE Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Engel">    Mr. David Donovan. Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Engel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Engel">You testified that pirate radio stations
outnumbered licensed stations in some major markets and, as in 
understand it, the draft legislation in front of us today would 
require, and I quote it, ``sustained enforcement and attention 
on pirate broadcasting,'' unquote, including the requirement 
that the FCC conduct pirate radio enforcement sweeps in some 
markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Engel">So to your knowledge, has any agency--DOJ, FCC, or any 
other--conducted regular pirate radio enforcement sweeps in the 
past? Do you have a sense for the amount of time, money, and 
personnel these sweeps would require?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Engel">Mr. David Donovan. To my knowledge, the Department of 
Justice had not done any sweeps. The FCC may have done one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Engel">In terms of time to do a sweep, for example, it took us 
four days to find 76 pirates in New York City and in northern 
New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Engel">So the actual amount of those sweeps does not take that 
amount of time, and in fact, with technology you can actually 
reduce the amount of time that you need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Engel">For example, there are pirate--there are radios that are 
currently on the market that you connect to the internet and 
you place them throughout New York City or northern New Jersey 
and you can sit in the FCC's office in Washington or in New 
York and literally turn the dial and you know what stations you 
have licensed and you will be able to hear what stations aren't 
licensed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Engel">That will tell you, depending on the location of where that 
radio is, that we know we have 30 pirates near Flatbush or we 
have some in the Bronx.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Engel">What it does is by using technology in a smart way we'll 
actually reduce the ability or reduce the burdens that are 
imposed by doing sweeps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Engel">But, frankly, we've done sweeps--I've done four sweeps over 
the last several years and, again, I found 76 pirates in four 
days. So it's not--the burden of doing the spectrum sweep is 
really not--it can be done, and the FCC has the capability and 
equipment to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Engel">    And, sir, to be blunt, I will be more than happy work with 
the Federal Communications Commission to help get those sweeps 
done.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Engel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Engel">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Engel">Ms. Morris, let me ask you a quick question. I think you 
point out something really important in your written testimony 
regarding the small entity regulatory bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Engel">The Paperwork Reduction Act and the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act already requires the FCC to contemplate the effects of new 
protections on small businesses and there is already a number 
of opportunities for small cable or phone companies to get 
waivers under the FCC's procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Engel">    So, in your view, are there too few avenues for small 
business to be accommodated in FCC proceedings?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Morris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Ms. Morris">It is my view that there are not too few--that
there are sufficient avenues already at the FCC. I am 
sympathetic to situations where a waiver, as in Mr. Gessner's 
case in his testimony, was not able to be achieved in a timely 
fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Ms. Morris">    We would simply advocate for a more surgical solution to 
those specific problems rather than the blunt tools that are--
would be employed under SERRO.

    <speaker>Mr. Engel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Engel">Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Engel">I yield back my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Engel">Mrs. Blackburn. Thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Engel">    Mr. Johnson, you're recognized. Three minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Thank you, Madam Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mr. Gessner, first of all, thanks for what you do in your 
role as the president of Massillon Cable. You serve a large 
number of people in one of my counties of 18, so I appreciate 
that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    I saw in your comments that you highlighted one example 
where the waiver process did not work in a timely fashion for 
you. Do you have other statistics or insights that you could 
share with us about that dynamic?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gessner</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Thank you. Thank you for your question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Gessner">Yes, I probably have four or five current examples that 
would probably be more anecdotal than anything else. But by way 
of description, I would refer to a staff report that was issued 
to this committee in 2011 and it was entitled ``The Staff 
Report on Workload at the FCC.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Gessner">And part of their conclusion was, and I quote, ``the 
commission faces significant challenges in its work including a 
significant backlog of unanswered petitions,'' and they went on 
to note that more than 5,300 petitions, which was 20 percent of 
the total petitions at that time, had been at the FCC for more 
than 2 years, and that more than 3,000 petitions had been 
pending before the FCC for more than 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Gessner">    And I think that's--it speaks volumes to the ability of 
small entities who don't have on-staff attorneys to keep after 
this process to see their petitions for needed relief through 
to a conclusion.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Johnson">And to give our Members and the American
people some idea of what that means on the business side, I am 
told that this cost can be up to $50,000 per year for a small 
company that, while they're awaiting resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    So you have got 5 years, that's $250,000 out of that small 
business. That's a--that's a big pot of money.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gessner</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Gessner"> Correct. That came from a more recent petition
request where a small telephone company applied for relief, and 
while it was granted in about 3 years, they estimated the cost 
to be about $50,000 a year, which for them is enough to hire 
another full time associate to actually serve customers.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Johnson">OK. Well, thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mr. Donovan, Mr. McKinley and Mr. Welch's bill, H.R. 2903, 
embodies the spirit of our effort to close the digital divide 
between rural and urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Johnson">What kind of data is necessary to close this divide on 
wireless broadband coverage?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mr. Tim Donovan. Thank you, Congressman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Johnson">As you know, the data that's currently on hand is not 
reflecting the experience that you have. Your portion of Ohio 
on the map looks like it's covered with service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    I think you have explained to me before how that's not the 
case.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Johnson">We know that's not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mr. Tim Donovan. So what the bill does is it takes a look 
at the services that are available in urban areas and uses that 
as a measuring stick to see what services should be available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    With that in place, you can then collect data based on the 
experience that other Americans are having to make sure that 
there's services available to everyone.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Well, thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Johnson">I wish we had more time to talk about it. But I understand 
you need to yield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Thank you, Madame Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mrs. Blackburn. I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mrs. Brooks for 3 minutes, please.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mrs. Brooks. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Johnson">I am going to follow up on what my colleague from Ohio just 
talked about, Mr. Donovan. Let's go on and allow you to answer 
a bit with a bit more time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Johnson">What kind of analysis does the FCC do as to whether or not 
its USF policies are meeting the goals of the program and do we 
have information on how effective USF program is in ensuring 
that comparable service that you just started to talk about?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mr. Tim Donovan. Thank you, Congresswoman, and thank you 
for joining the bill as a cosponsor. We appreciate the support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Johnson">So right now, as Mr. Welch noted during his opening 
statement, there is no determination of what is reasonably 
comparable services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Johnson">So the FCC collects data. They collect Form 477 data. They 
collected, in the case of mobility fund, a special one-time 
collection of data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Johnson">But they're not then going back and applying any sort of 
report card over whether that's working, whether we are getting 
the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Johnson">And so we are continuing to move forward and as we are 
talking frequently about 5G, there are places in the country 
that don't have any G.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Johnson">We have a saying at CCA that you have to keep up with your 
G's and when you start falling behind on the digital divide it 
gets harder and harder to catch up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Johnson">That becomes even more important as so many different 
aspects of our society are connected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mrs. Brooks. Is it fair to say if we--if we do resolve some 
of these issues involving the digital divide, whether it is the 
targeted support through the USF program and siting reform, 
access to spectrum, is it possible that those rural areas will 
jump to 5G?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mr. Tim Donovan. Well, you just nailed the three-legged 
stool of infrastructure, spectrum, and USF. Those are all 
important to solving these problems in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Johnson">And yes, so carriers that are now looking at making sure 
you get to the 4G services or looking at how you can layer on 
top of that at the same time the 5G services, whether it's 
through technology or they're using different spectrum bands to 
make sure that the same services are available in urban areas 
and rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mrs. Brooks. Thank you. I will yield back the balance of my 
time. I know we are trying to get other Members in. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mrs. Blackburn. I thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    Mr. Collins, you're recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Collins</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Collins">Thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Collins">My question is directed to David Donovan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Collins">Thank you again for your testimony today on pirate radio. 
This bill is going to create a database of licensed radio 
operators. I call that a commonsense kind of bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Collins">I've been battling this for years, primarily with our 
former Chair Tom Wheeler, who, frankly, as Chair of the FCC did 
not seem interested at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Collins">I can assure you Ajit Pai, our new FCC Chair, does take 
this seriously, to which I think we are going to see a big 
change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Collins">You know, obviously, these pirate radio operators are 
raising money. In some cases we have advertisers who have no 
idea it's a pirate radio so, again, our commonsense bill will 
let them easily scan through and say oops, I am not going to be 
sending money this way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Collins">So to keep this brief, I will just turn it over to you, 
David, to maybe comment on how this should work in helping 
deprive these stations of revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Collins">Mr. David Donovan. Congressman, and thank you for your 
leadership on the issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Collins">I think one of the problems that you have in not just in 
New York but in Florida, in Boston, in Connecticut is that your 
illegal operators take on the aura of a legitimate station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Collins">As a result, advertisers, including folks buying political 
time, have no idea that they're buying advertising on an 
illegal station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Collins">I think it would be important for the FCC to create 
transparency, which would be to list all the stations in a 
market that are in fact licensed by the FCC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Collins">List all the stations that it knows are illegal, and that 
list, making it easily accessible so you don't have to dig down 
12 layers into the FCC database, would make it--a Web site 
that's publically available and easily accessible would go a 
long way towards advertisers understanding oh, OK, this person 
isn't licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Collins">    And I think that transparency in the marketplace would be 
very, very important to helping to resolve those who are 
facilitating illegal pirate operations, sir. I think it's a 
great idea.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Collins</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Collins">And, hopefully, as you say, let's list the
illegal operators, hopefully under Chairman Ajit Pai, he'll be 
putting them out of business instead of listing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Collins">    Mr. David Donovan. We hope. Absolutely we hope, and with 
the help of Congress to actually increase the enforcement tools 
and your suggestion, I think that will go a long way.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Collins</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Collins">Well, thank you for your testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Collins">Madam Chair, I yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Collins">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Collins">I have questions that I am going to submit in the interests 
of time and, Tim and Mr. Gessner, they'll come to you--looking 
at the efforts we are doing on streamlining and how those, with 
the FCC, how that will help speed broadband deployment. But I 
will submit that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Collins">    Mr. Madigan, I've got one that will come to you. We will UC 
Mr. Tonko on for either submission or questions or a real quick 
ask?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tonko</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Real quick ask, and I thank you for waiting
beyond to the subcommittee, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Tonko">I have several serious concerns with pirate radio and the 
weakness of current enforcement, which, in turn, has encouraged 
pirate radio operators to continue undeterred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Tonko">For years now, I, along with many members of New York and 
New Jersey delegations, have voiced our concerns on this issue, 
yet pirate radio operators are as prevalent as every and their 
actions have been met with few consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Tonko">This legislation, obviously, comes in response to the 
growing number of pirate radio broadcasters in the region that 
are harming consumers and public safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Tonko">According to complaints filed with the FCC, the number of 
pirate FM radio stations throughout New York City could 
outnumber the number of licensed operations while the problem 
in northern New Jersey may be equally as pervasive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Tonko">In Albany, we had a problem with private radio operators 
where a private--a pirate radio station was interfering with 
another legitimate station and was a nuisance to my 
constituents who were exposed oftentimes to what was vulgar 
language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Tonko">I've worked on this legislation and am proud to have done 
so in a bipartisan way with Congressman Leonard Lance, and I 
hope that this committee will work and move this forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Tonko">To Mr. Donovan--Mr. David Donovan, what effect can pirate 
radio have on the emergency alert systems?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Mr. David Donovan. What it does is it interferes with those 
who rely on the emergency alert system--consumers who are 
listening to the radio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Pirate stations don't participate in the alert system and 
the pirate stations actually interfere with the EAS signals 
that consumers rely on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Tonko">In addition to that, it also interferes with any important 
lifesaving news that follows up. You take it one step beyond, 
and apart the EAS, the interference to FAA frequencies is 
rather scary because the enforcement is post hoc.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Tonko">    The interference occurs while the plane is trying to land, 
and then you have to go try to find the pirate, and those 
situations, taken together, create a very dangerous situation, 
sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tonko</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Thank you for that clarification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Mrs. Blackburn. Mr. Tonko, I need to limit you to that 
question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Tonko">    Mr. Schrader has come in, and they have called the vote. If 
you don't mind.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tonko</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Tonko">OK. Thank you. OK. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Tonko">Mrs. Blackburn. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Tonko">    Mr. Schrader, you're recognized, 3 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Schrader</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking Member
Doyle, for allowing me to sit in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Sorry I couldn't spend more time here throughout the 
hearing. We are bouncing back and forth. We've got another 
hearing in the Health Subcommittee that we are talking care of, 
too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Schrader">I just want a few minutes to speak in favor of H.R. 3787, 
the Small Entity Regulatory Relief Opportunity Act. It's a bill 
I am working on with Representative Latta. I want to thank him 
and his team for all their help and support. Good bipartisan 
effort here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Every member of the committee wants to expand rural 
broadband. The answer to doing that isn't necessarily always 
more money. Burdensome regulations harm many of these small 
entities' ability to grow, expand, and hire new employees, and 
maybe we can do something to alleviate some of those burdens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Hopefully, by establishing some of these streamlined 
procedures in the bill, by obtaining waivers from regulations 
that are often unnecessary and not even designed for these 
smaller entities we provide a little relief for our small 
telecom providers, with a little greater certainty and 
efficiency to help them to continue to do the things they do 
best for our very, very small and rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Schrader">At the basic level, we are finally recognizing locally 
based small business do not have the same ability as major 
corporations to comply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Many of these small entities have an entire workforce of, 
like, eight or 10 people. They don't have the resources or 
floor of lawyers to file petition after petition with the FCC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Schrader">I think it's incumbent we all recognize and acknowledge 
that these unique--that there are unique business regulatory 
challenges for these small entities and we are trying to help 
them with this bill here and would hope the committee and 
Congress and gentleman out there would share and consider this 
bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Mrs. Blackburn. And I think there's been plenty of support 
expressed for that today, and also Representative Stewart has 
entered the room and we thank him for the work that he has done 
on the suicide bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Seeing there are no further Members wishing to ask 
questions for the panel, I want to thank our witnesses very 
much for your patience today, for being here with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Schrader">As we've said, it is a busy day, just a few things going 
on, both in Energy and Commerce and on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Before I conclude, I ask unanimous consent to enter the 
following documents in the record: Mr. Donovan's slides, and 
Mr. Lance, the New York State Broadcasters' pirate radio study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Without objection, so ordered.\1\

    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Schrader">Mrs. Blackburn. Pursuant to committee rules, I remind 
Members that they have 10 business days to submit additional 
questions for the record, and I ask that each of you witnesses 
respond to these questions within 10 business days upon receipt

    <Statement>
    <opening>Prepared statement of Hon. Leonard Lance</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance">[Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance">Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank you to our 
distinguished panel for appearing before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance">I am pleased we are considering the Preventing Illegal 
Radio Abuse Through Enforcement, or PIRATE, Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance">Unlicensed FM and AM radio operators are a significant harm 
to public safety and public health. By disrupting and 
interfering with licensed broadcasts, these ``pirate radios'' 
can cause radio listeners to miss important updates during 
times of emergency by blocking the Emergency Alert System. As 
they do not adhere to FCC regulations, pirate radios also emit 
a harmful level of Radio Frequency radiation, posing a health 
risk to nearby residents and workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance">I commend Chairman Pai and Commissioner O'Rielly for their 
leadership in enforcing against pirate radio operators at the 
FCC. However, as Commissioner O'Rielly has stated before this 
subcommittee, the FCC's current enforcement tools are not 
sufficient to eliminate these bad actors. My bill would 
increase the FCC's ability to crackdown on pirates by 
increasing the maximum fine, streamlining enforcement and 
holding facilitators liable among other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance">I thank Congressmen Tonko, Collins, and Bilirakis for their 
leadership on this issue and for working with me on this 
important legislation. Our States are among the most affected 
by pirate radio operators in the country and I am pleased we 
are able to work bipartisanly to protect our constituents from 
these menaces to public safety and health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Hon. Leonard Lance">Thank you also to David Donovan from the New York 
Broadcasters for your advocacy on this issue and for testifying 
today. I look forward to our discussion.</paragraph>
