    <option>Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific,</option>
    <option>                     Committee on Foreign Affairs,
                            Washington, DC.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:30 p.m., in 
room 2200 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ted Yoho 
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
    Mr. Yoho. The subcommittee will come to order.
    Good afternoon. We have called this markup to order today 
to consider four important measures that touch on pressing 
challenges that the United States faces in the Asia-Pacific 
region. After the conclusion of this brief business meeting, we 
will proceed immediately to our scheduled hearing on U.S.-
Taiwan ties.
    Pursuant to notice, we have four bipartisan measures on our 
agenda this afternoon. As members were notified yesterday, it 
is the intention of the Chair to consider today's business en 
bloc so that we can proceed promptly to our hearing. All 
members may have 5 days to insert remarks into the record and, 
without objection, the following measures and amendments will 
be considered en bloc: House Resolution 311, reaffirming 40 
years of relations between the United States and the 
Association of the Southeast Asian Nations; Yoho Amendment 37 
in the Nature of a Substitute to H. Resolution 311; H.R. 535, 
the Taiwan Travel Act; H.R. 2061, the North Korean Human Rights 
Reauthorization Act of 2017; Yoho Amendment 38 to H.R. 2061; 
and H.R. 2397, the Distribution and Promotion of Rights and 
Knowledge of DPRK Act of 2017.
    Before turning to our ranking member, I recognize myself to 
speak on--and the Connolly Amendment--excuse me--Amendment 26 
to H.R. 2061. And thank you.

    <Statement>
    <opening>[The information referred to follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="">                       House of Representatives,
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoho</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Yoho">First, we have House Resolution 311, which
recognizes 40 years of the U.S.-ASEAN ties and reaffirms the 
economic security interests we share with this dynamic group of 
countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Yoho">I want to thank Representatives Wagner and Castro, who 
chair the recently revived ASEAN Caucus. We are offering this 
measure for focusing on an area that is sometimes overlooked 
but very much deserving of our attention. The 10 nations of 
ASEAN have tremendous potential for growth and share our 
interests in a secure bipolar Asia. So, reaffirming our 
relations is an important undertaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Yoho">We will also consider the Taiwan Travel Act authored by Mr. 
Chabot, the chairman emeritus of the subcommittee. Chairman 
Chabot's bill will strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations by 
codifying a policy of greater freedom of movement for the 
Republic of China officials in the United States and will also 
facilitate more high-level interactions between our 
governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Yoho">In the face of China's intensifying efforts to restrict 
Taiwan's international space, strengthening our relationships 
with Taiwan is especially important. So I thank Chairman Chabot 
for introducing this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Next, we consider Chairman Ros-Lehtinen's reauthorization 
of the North Korea Human Rights Act, as the 2014 U.N. 
Commission of Inquiry of North Korea found the gravity, scale, 
and nature of human rights abuses reveals a state that does not 
have any parallel in the contemporary world. Indeed, the Kim 
regime is the world's worst human rights abuser and North Korea 
Human Rights Act is a fundamental part of congressional 
leadership to end these abuses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Yoho">I have offered a technical amendment to this legislation to 
unify some of its authorization with legislation the committee 
has passed since the Human Rights Act was last reauthorized and 
look forward to sending this bill to the full committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Finally, we consider the Distribution and Promotion of 
Rights and Knowledge Act of 2017. This bill will promote the 
freedom of information and democracy in North Korea and I would 
like to thank the ranking member, Mr. Sherman, as well as 
Chairman Royce, and Ranking Member Engel of the full committee 
for joining us as original cosponsors on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Yoho">This bill will expand the authority of the President and 
the Broadcasting Board of Governors to transmit and distribute 
information inside North Korea, one of the surest ways to 
weaken the Kim regime's grip on power, to promote freedom and 
liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Yoho">My sincere thanks to my colleagues for joining us today to 
move these important measures further along in the legislative 
process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Yoho">    I now recognize our ranking member, Mr. Sherman, for any 
remarks he may have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Sherman">We have four excellent bills. We should pass them. I 
understand we will pass then en bloc and before we do that, we 
should adopt the, I believe, en bloc amendment to H.R. 2061, 
which includes the amendment from Mr. Connolly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Sherman">    With that, unless someone wants me to yield time, I yield 
back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoho</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Yoho"> Members seeking recognition will be recognized
for brief remarks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Chabot</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Chabot">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Chabot</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Chabot">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Chabot">I want to thank the chairman for bringing this legislation 
before the subcommittee today. I rise in support of H.R. 535, 
the Taiwan Travel Act, a bill that I, along with my colleague 
and friend from California, Mr. Sherman, introduced earlier 
this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Chabot">As a founding member of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I 
take the commitments of our country with Taiwan very seriously. 
Yesterday, I expressed my concerns to the Secretary of State, 
Tillerson, regarding our own self-imposed restrictions that 
prohibit high-ranking United States officials from meeting with 
their Taiwanese counterparts and, worse, bars Taiwanese 
officials from setting foot in our Nation's capital, in this 
city right here. It is ridiculous. This is a center of 
democracy and freedom. Taiwanese officials should be able to 
come and meet with American officials here in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Chabot">This policy goes against our own self-interest. It tells 
China that we are willing to yield to them on our own foreign 
policy. It conveys weakness, I believe, to Beijing. Not only 
does restricting visits by high-level Taiwanese decision-makers 
tie our leaders' hands and insult an ally, it makes it nearly 
impossible to conduct diplomacy in an increasingly critical 
region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Chabot">The United States should have direct dialogue with the 
democratically-elected leadership of Taiwan and it is time to 
change this outdated policy. The Taiwan Travel Act will do 
this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Chabot">China continues to take aggressive actions that further its 
long-running campaign to isolate Taiwan. The United States has 
a legal and moral commitment to defend Taiwan sovereignty in 
the face of these attacks. Restricting high-level visits from 
Taiwan insults and ally and damages our national security in an 
increasingly dangerous world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Chabot">The United States should encourage direct dialogue with the 
democratically-elected leadership of our ally, Taiwan. It is 
time to change our policy. I encourage my colleagues to support 
this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Chabot">    I once again want to thank Mr. Sherman for his leadership 
on this issue as well, making it a bipartisan measure. And I 
yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoho</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Thank you, Mr. Chabot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Next we will go to Ms. Gabbard. Did you have a comment?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Mrs. Wagner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Mrs. Wagner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Yoho">I would like to express my support for all of today's 
initiatives, including the Taiwan Travel Act, which I believe 
can be, frankly, the cornerstone for a more what I will call a 
mature relationship with Taiwan that recognizes Taiwan's 
tremendous contributions to both democracy and to stability in 
the Asia Pacific.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Yoho">I would also like to speak specifically in support of House 
Resolution 311, the resolution I was honored to introduce with 
my colleague, Representative Castro, in commemoration of 
ASEAN's 50th anniversary and the 40th anniversary of U.S.-ASEAN 
relations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Southeast Asia has tremendous cultural, political, 
historical, and religious diversity. ASEAN was formed, in part, 
to create a bulwark against communism in the Southeast Asia 
among these diverse nations. And today, ASEAN's goals have 
evolved and the region is experiencing tremendous growth, 
nearly $100 billion in U.S. goods and services are exported to 
ASEAN, rivaling our $113 billion market in China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Yoho">In January, I founded the bipartisan Congressional Caucus 
on ASEAN with my colleague, Congressman Castro. The Caucus 
acknowledges America's special relationship with ASEAN and 
defines ways that Congress can strengthen security, economic, 
technical, and humanitarian engagement in Southeast Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Yoho">House Resolution 311 was one of our first initiatives and I 
am grateful that the chair and the ranking member are strong 
supporters of this effort. The resolution supports and affirms 
the elevation of the United States-ASEAN relationship to a 
strategic partnership and reaffirms a U.S. commitment to 
promoting a rules-based order in the Asia Pacific and economic 
growth, peace, human rights, and stability in Southeast Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Yoho">    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoho</speaker>

    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Sherman"> Mr. Chairman, we amended H.R. 2061 with the
two en bloc amendments as part of this?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoho</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Yoho"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Sherman"> Okay, so it includes both adopting the en bloc
amendment to 2061 and your motion also passes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoho</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Yoho"> Yes, sir, and I thank you for pointing that out.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Sherman">That makes it an outstanding motion, Mr.
Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Oh, we may have one more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Sherman">    [Simultaneous speaking.]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoho</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Yoho"> We have the honor of being joined by Ms. Ros-
Lehtinen. Do you have a comment that you would like to----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Sherman">And I do want to remark I am thrilled that the
left wing of this table has become so popular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Sherman">    Mrs. Wagner. Solidarity! Solidarity!
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Sherman">We are just moderating that side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Now that FOX has let go of its fair and 
balanced slogan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Thank you, Dr. Yoho, and thank you, Ranking Member Sherman. 
We have our own subcommittee hearing on Russia and the Middle 
East downstairs, so I am a little out of breath. But thank you 
for working with our office to bring the North Korea Human 
Right Reauthorization Act of 2017 to markup today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Sherman">I was proud to author and lead the reauthorization of this 
important law in both 2008 and 2012, and I am proud to do so 
again with the measure before you today, H.R. 2061.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Since 2004, the Human Rights Act of North Korea has 
provided us in the United States with a number of essential 
tools, designed to promote North Korean human rights. H.R. 2061 
ensures that those tools will continue to be available, 
including authorizing grants that promote human rights, 
democracy and the rule of law; authorizing actions aimed at 
promoting the freedom of information, including increasing the 
availability of information sources not controlled by the Kim 
regime; authorizing humanitarian assistance to North Korean 
refugees, defectors, migrants, and orphans, as well as women 
who are victims of trafficking. It also ensures that the 
Special Envoy for North Korea Human Rights Issues; once someone 
is re-appointed, as is required by the original law, continues 
reporting to Congress on how he or she is fulfilling their 
responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Every day under the Kim regime, North Koreans are suffering 
unimaginable horrors. They live under constant fear of arrest, 
of disappearance, of execution. They are exploited. They are 
trafficked, while dissidents are starved and tortured. Rule of 
law, justice, and freedom of expression simply do not exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Sherman">With this bill, we ensure that our efforts in the United 
States to promote North Korean human rights continue, that 
desperately needed information is getting to those inside, and 
that refugees fleeing the regime are receiving protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Before I go, I would like to express my support for 
Chairman Yoho's Distribution and Promotion of Rights and 
Knowledge Act, which makes some very valuable additions to the 
North Korea Human Rights Act, including promoting additional 
methods of electronic communication and authorizing the 
broadcast of popular culture, as well as knowledge about the 
rights, the laws, the freedoms which North Koreans should be 
afforded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Sherman">The Kim regime cannot be allowed to maintain its monopoly 
on information and we must continue to explore every possible 
avenue in order to allow North Koreans to get the information 
they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Sherman">    I thank the chair. I thank the ranking member and all the 
members for allowing me to join you today. And I yield back. 
Thank you, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoho</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Thank you, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Everybody wants to
know why you stay so fit and it is because you run from one 
committee hearing to the next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. From one meal to the next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Yoho">    Voice. And I am coming to the next, too.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoho</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Hearing no further requests for recognition, the
question occurs on the items considered en bloc, along with the 
approval of the amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Yoho">All those in favor say aye.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Yoho">Opposed?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Yoho">In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and the 
measures considered en bloc are agreed to. Without objection, 
the measures considered en bloc are ordered favorably reported 
to the full committee, as amended, and staff is directed to 
make any technical and conforming changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Yoho">That concludes our markup.</paragraph>
