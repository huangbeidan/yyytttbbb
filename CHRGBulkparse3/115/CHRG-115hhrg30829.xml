    <info>ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE               </info>
    <info>The Helsinki process, formally titled the Conference on Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe, traces its origin to the signing of the </info>
    <info>Helsinki Final Act in Finland on August 1, 1975, by the leaders of 33 </info>
    <info>European countries, the United States and Canada. As of January 1, </info>
    <info>1995, the Helsinki process was renamed the Organization for Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE]. The membership of the OSCE has </info>
    <info>expanded to 56 participating States, reflecting the breakup of the </info>
    <info>Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.</info>
    <info>    The OSCE Secretariat is in Vienna, Austria, where weekly meetings </info>
    <info>of the participating States' permanent representatives are held. In </info>
    <info>addition, specialized seminars and meetings are convened in various </info>
    <info>locations. Periodic consultations are held among Senior Officials, </info>
    <info>Ministers and Heads of State or Government.</info>
    <info>    Although the OSCE continues to engage in standard setting in the </info>
    <info>fields of military security, economic and environmental cooperation, </info>
    <info>and human rights and humanitarian concerns, the Organization is </info>
    <info>primarily focused on initiatives designed to prevent, manage and </info>
    <info>resolve conflict within and among the participating States. The </info>
    <info>Organization deploys numerous missions and field activities located in </info>
    <info>Southeastern and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The </info>
    <info>website of the OSCE is: &amp;lt;www.osce.org&amp;gt;.</info>
    <info>ABOUT THE COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE</info>
    <info>    The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as </info>
    <info>the Helsinki Commission, is a U.S. Government agency created in 1976 to </info>
    <info>monitor and encourage compliance by the participating States with their </info>
    <info>OSCE commitments, with a particular emphasis on human rights.</info>
    <info>    The Commission consists of nine members from the United States </info>
    <info>Senate, nine members from the House of Representatives, and one member </info>
    <info>each from the Departments of State, Defense and Commerce. The positions </info>
    <info>of Chair and Co-Chair rotate between the Senate and House every two </info>
    <info>years, when a new Congress convenes. A professional staff assists the </info>
    <info>Commissioners in their work.</info>
    <info>    In fulfilling its mandate, the Commission gathers and disseminates </info>
    <info>relevant information to the U.S. Congress and the public by convening </info>
    <info>hearings, issuing reports that reflect the views of Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission and/or its staff, and providing details about the activities </info>
    <info>of the Helsinki process and developments in OSCE participating States.</info>
    <info>    The Commission also contributes to the formulation and execution of </info>
    <info>U.S. policy regarding the OSCE, including through Member and staff </info>
    <info>participation on U.S. Delegations to OSCE meetings. Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission have regular contact with parliamentarians, government </info>
    <info>officials, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and </info>
    <info>private individuals from participating States. The website of the </info>
    <info>Commission is: &amp;lt;www.csce.gov&amp;gt;.</info>

    <info>    Dr. Thompson. Good morning. My name is Dr. Mischa Thompson, and </info>
    <info>welcome to ``Transatlantic Relations in Flux,'' a briefing on the U.S.-</info>
    <info>EU relationship hosted by the U.S. Commission on Security and </info>
    <info>Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission. For those </info>
    <info>of who you may not know, the Helsinki Commission is an independent U.S. </info>
    <info>Government agency focused on human rights, economics, and security in </info>
    <info>the 57 North American and European countries that make up the </info>
    <info>Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or the OSCE. The </info>
    <info>commission is bicameral and bipartisan, and comprised of members of </info>
    <info>Congress and the executive branch, including our U.S. State Department. </info>
    <info>More on our commission can be found at www.csce.gov. You can also find </info>
    <info>us on Facebook and on Twitter at @HelsinkiComm.</info>
    <info>    We are so fortunate today to be joined by three members of the </info>
    <info>delegation from the European Parliament's Civil Liberties, Justice, and </info>
    <info>Home Affairs Committee, visiting Washington, DC to attend the </info>
    <info>Transatlantic Policy Network's acclaimed Transatlantic Week. We thank </info>
    <info>Jorn Fleck and his team for helping to facilitate today's briefing, and </info>
    <info>are only sorry that they cannot be with us today as they are also </info>
    <info>currently hosting an event. We also thank Antoine Rippel and Holger </info>
    <info>Benzig for helping us to arrange today's event so quickly.</info>
    <info>    I think today's event couldn't be more timely, in that it's simply </info>
    <info>taking place on the heels of our president's European travel and ahead </info>
    <info>of meetings planned for July 25th with the head of the European </info>
    <info>Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, who will travel to Washington, DC to </info>
    <info>meet with our president. You can find the bios of today's panelists, </info>
    <info>who are all members of the European Parliament, or MEPs, in the blue </info>
    <info>folders and online. Given that we have about an hour, I will begin by </info>
    <info>asking a few questions, after which we will have time for questions and </info>
    <info>discussion from the audience, including those with us online. Given </info>
    <info>that we are also taping this briefing, I ask everyone to please speak </info>
    <info>directly into their microphones. And for those of you here on the </info>
    <info>panel, you will need to press the red button to talk.</info>
    <info>    And with that, I will begin by introducing you. To my right we have </info>
    <info>member of the European Parliament Claude Moraes of the United Kingdom, </info>
    <info>who's also chair of the European Parliament Committee on Civil </info>
    <info>Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs, and a member of the Progressive </info>
    <info>Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. To my left we have MEP Michal </info>
    <info>Boni of Poland, a member of the Civil Liberties and Constitutional </info>
    <info>Affairs Committees, as well as vice chair of the EU-Moldova </info>
    <info>Parliamentary Association Committee, and member of the European </info>
    <info>People's Party. Further to my left we have MEP Nathalie Griesbeck of </info>
    <info>France, chair of the European Parliament's Special Committee on </info>
    <info>Terrorism and member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for </info>
    <info>Europe.</info>
    <info>    And so with that, I will actually turn to MEP Moraes and just ask </info>
    <info>if you can start by telling us why you're here in Washington right now, </info>
    <info>what is the purpose of your delegation's visit, who are you meeting </info>
    <info>with, and what is it you hope to accomplish.</info>
    <info>    MEP Moraes. Okay, thank you very much, Mischa, and thank you to the </info>
    <info>Helsinki Commission for this kind invitation. I should remind people </info>
    <info>also that you in the Helsinki Commission have regularly come to </info>
    <info>Brussels, to the European Parliament. So this is a vehicle for really </info>
    <info>good cooperation between the European Parliament and the institutions </info>
    <info>here between you and Congress. So it's great to be here.</info>
    <info>    Maybe first to say that a lot of interesting things happened in </info>
    <info>Helsinki. And maybe one of the best things was the creation of the </info>
    <info>Helsinki Commission. And one of the reasons we're here is to do what </info>
    <info>was in the founding principles and the signature in 1975, which is to </info>
    <info>strengthen relationships between the European Union and the United </info>
    <info>States. Within that very abstract statement lies a program for us which </info>
    <info>is very specific and very focused. And it represents the difference </info>
    <info>between perhaps what would have been a 1975 program, when many of you </info>
    <info>would not have been born--some would--and that would be the advances in </info>
    <info>what cooperation means.</info>
    <info>    So, our specific thematic issues include data transfers both in the </info>
    <info>commercial and security areas. Privacy Shield, for example, the success </info>
    <info>of Safe Harbor, the whole issue of the CLOUD Act and how it coalesces </info>
    <info>with the Umbrella Agreement, these very major international agreements </info>
    <info>in data transfers--the wider area, as my colleague Nathalie Griesbeck </info>
    <info>will talk about, the whole area of security cooperation and data </info>
    <info>transfers to make our two continents safer from terrorist attacks. So </info>
    <info>the issue of counterterrorism cooperation, and cybersecurity, which has </info>
    <info>taken on an extraordinarily new vista, which is now not just about </info>
    <info>protecting our critical infrastructure but also protecting our </info>
    <info>democracy.</info>
    <info>    We've seen the Cambridge Analytica crisis. And it's about ensuring </info>
    <info>that we protect our democracies, our elections from interference, as </info>
    <info>we've seen from Russia, and to ensure that in order to do that we are </info>
    <info>cooperating, and we understand what the issues are. So these are some </info>
    <info>of the issues that our committee in particular will be and have been </info>
    <info>discussing with our counterparts and their detailed passenger name </info>
    <info>records, actual international agreements. So we're highly focused and </info>
    <info>we're regular in visiting. And we hope to make progress in all of these </info>
    <info>areas.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. Now, we titled this briefing ``Transatlantic </info>
    <info>Relations in Flux.'' And there's been a lot of recent focus, rightly </info>
    <info>so, on the flux, or all of the changes that have been taking place in </info>
    <info>the U.S. approach to relations with Europe. However, I'd like to take a </info>
    <info>step back today and think about where it is we would ideally like to </info>
    <info>see the transatlantic relationship. So if we were to look into the </info>
    <info>future in a decade or two, where is it we would actually like for </info>
    <info>transatlantic relations to be? And are we currently on the path to </info>
    <info>getting there? And I'll actually turn to MEP Boni to ask your thoughts </info>
    <info>on where it is you would ideally see the transatlantic relationship in </info>
    <info>10 years.</info>
    <info>    MEP Boni. First of all, thank you very much for the invitation. I </info>
    <info>was a student in 1975 when the Helsinki conference occurred. And after </info>
    <info>that, it was kind of an opening in some countries. In 1976, in my </info>
    <info>country, the committee for defending workers was established. And as a </info>
    <info>student, I was involved in dissemination and propagation of the first </info>
    <info>underground newspapers--it was the beginning of our fight for freedom. </info>
    <info>So, from that time to today, when the Helsinki Commission in Warsaw, in </info>
    <info>Poland, is very active defending democracy and freedom, I see the </info>
    <info>Helsinki idea, the Helsinki Commission as one of the important </info>
    <info>movements in defending democracy all over the world.</info>
    <info>    And of course, we need transatlantic relations if we want to have </info>
    <info>and to develop the opportunity to defend the liberal democracy which, I </info>
    <info>hope, is the core of Western values. And I think also the transatlantic </info>
    <info>values. So this is one key point. Second, I think that this is a chance </info>
    <info>to establish the future of transatlantic competitive advantages, </info>
    <info>especially in the digital field. And we need to work on it. And also, </info>
    <info>this is a possibility in transatlantic relations to create positive </info>
    <info>reference points for global development in many areas. Global </info>
    <info>development means economic development, but it also means ensuring that </info>
    <info>democracy is functioning. It's one of the key issues.</info>
    <info>    And of course, when I'm looking at that time frame I need to define </info>
    <info>some obstacles. It is difficult to develop future-oriented cooperation </info>
    <info>when we are starting trade wars as it was in the 19th century--not </info>
    <info>20th, 19th century. It is difficult to develop policy, to develop </info>
    <info>policy protection and create a good global reference point for privacy </info>
    <info>protection when we are starting to consider how many threats and </info>
    <info>concerns the CLOUD Act, passed in the U.S., is bringing. It is </info>
    <info>difficult to take common responsibility for global development when the </info>
    <info>U.S. authorities decide to withdraw the signature from the Paris </info>
    <info>Agreement, so it means that there is no possibility to cooperate for </info>
    <info>saving the globe against the environmental collapse.</info>
    <info>    And it is difficult to build a common defense strategy in a time in </info>
    <info>which the EU is taking a new responsibility for defense, when EU </info>
    <info>partners are humiliated by the president of the United States, as it </info>
    <info>was last week in the NATO summit in Brussels. And it is difficult to </info>
    <info>develop transatlantic relations without political stability, rather </info>
    <info>with strong uncertainty. We need to come back to the path of stability </info>
    <info>of those relations. But there are problems not only on the U.S. side. </info>
    <info>There are also many problems on our European side.</info>
    <info>    I'm from Poland, and I'm living in a country in which the ruling </info>
    <info>party is undermining the democracy, the freedoms, and also the rule of </info>
    <info>law and the independence of the judicial system. Now we are fighting </info>
    <info>for the Supreme Court and keeping the Supreme Court independent. It's </info>
    <info>not so easy to say that we will win this battle. The same situation is </info>
    <info>in Hungary. One month ago, Hungary approved legislation which is full </info>
    <info>of punishment for people who are ready to support and to help refugees. </info>
    <info>The same situation is growing in Slovakia, where an independent </info>
    <info>journalist was killed some months ago. The same situation is growing in </info>
    <info>the Czech Republic and in Romania, and some countries. Also in Italy.</info>
    <info>    So, there is a big problem on both sides of the transatlantic </info>
    <info>geography model. And I think that if we want, in the perspective of 10 </info>
    <info>years, to develop and to make many solutions much more advanced in the </info>
    <info>digital realm, in the economic realm--we need now to start and to fight </info>
    <info>for democracy, freedoms, and the rule of law on both sides of the </info>
    <info>Atlantic.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. Before we go any deeper into your comments, I would </info>
    <info>like to turn to MEP Griesbeck, and ask where do you see things in 10 </info>
    <info>years? Do you agree with MEP Boni's assessment in terms of what the </info>
    <info>ideal relationship should be and what some of the obstacles are in </info>
    <info>getting there?</info>
    <info>    MEP Griesbeck. Yes. First of all, thank you very much, Mischa, for </info>
    <info>organizing this meeting. Sorry for my bad English, because I am French </info>
    <info>and it's--I did not--my studies in United States. But I like very much. </info>
    <info>I was an international visitor at the 20th century. It's a long time </info>
    <info>before. [Laughs.] But it was a very marvelous time for me. And I like </info>
    <info>very much to come. Today I come to United States in this prestigious </info>
    <info>Congress and with the delegation. And it's for me a great pleasure.</info>
    <info>    I am with Mr. Michael Speiser, he is the chief administrator for a </info>
    <info>different committee in the European Parliament. It's also an honor for </info>
    <info>me to speak today to the Helsinki Commission. That reminds us of the </info>
    <info>name of the city of the summit Helsinki 2 days ago between your </info>
    <info>president and Mr. Putin. And it's a strange situation, because for me </info>
    <info>the Helsinki Commission is an institution that has been created in </info>
    <info>order to announce consideration of human rights in the formulation of </info>
    <info>U.S. foreign policymaking, and to support democratic change in the </info>
    <info>countries of the former Soviet bloc.</info>
    <info>    One, the principles standing at the creation of the commission have </info>
    <info>lost nothing of their importance today. They are the expression of our </info>
    <info>shared values, as Michal Boni said just before. And it's very </info>
    <info>important. And principles that our countries follow, and without which </info>
    <info>our democracies could not exist. The respect for freedom, equality, </info>
    <info>civil liberties, rule of law, and democracy are values upon which our </info>
    <info>societies are built. And it's, for me, to answer to your question, the </info>
    <info>work to do for the 10 years in front of us. But it is work from the </info>
    <info>human dimension, the Helsinki Commission also monitors developments </info>
    <info>regarding the security dimensions.</info>
    <info>    And its activities in recent years have been included in hearings </info>
    <info>on combating terrorism. Terrorist organizations violate the basic human </info>
    <info>rights of people, such as the right to life and physical and </info>
    <info>psychological integrity. As chair of the Special Committee Against </info>
    <info>Terrorism, the fight against terrorists, these common positions are </info>
    <info>very important. Currently we are experiencing some tensions in the </info>
    <info>relationship between our countries, as my colleagues said. For example, </info>
    <info>also, it was not mentioned in our trade relations, at the same time, to </info>
    <info>our regret, the U.S. has decided to disengage from U.N. efforts such as </info>
    <info>U.N. human rights, UNESCO, and Paris Agreement on climate change.</info>
    <info>    Despite this, speaking here today as the chair of the Special </info>
    <info>Committee on Terrorism, I would like to stress that the U.S. is one of </info>
    <info>our most important partners in the fight against terrorism. I went </info>
    <info>yesterday to the terrorist training center. And we have a very </info>
    <info>interesting meeting with the intelligence services, with the FBI, and </info>
    <info>we have to work together in the fight against terrorism because it's a </info>
    <info>global threat--it's a world, global threat. And we need to be together </info>
    <info>to fight against these bad things. And it was very, very interesting to </info>
    <info>speak with your intelligence services, because they are extraordinarily </info>
    <info>well organized.</info>
    <info>    I want to say this today, we are guided by the shared concern for </info>
    <info>the security of our citizens and face the same threats. Some of the </info>
    <info>recent attempted terrorist attacks in the EU have been thwarted thanks </info>
    <info>to information received from U.S. intelligence services. And without it </info>
    <info>would be most difficult to fight against them. And the cooperation in </info>
    <info>this field has increased very much in recent years to mutual benefit. </info>
    <info>The Committee of Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament recently </info>
    <info>adopted its report on EU-U.S. relations, according to which the </info>
    <info>European Union and the United States building on the strong foundation </info>
    <info>of shared values and principles should use all available channels of </info>
    <info>communication in order to strengthen the transatlantic relationship.</info>
    <info>    The U.S. Congress and the European Parliament should, with regard </info>
    <info>to this, use the full potential of the cooperation to preserve the </info>
    <info>democratic, liberal, and multilateral order, and to promote stability </info>
    <info>and continuity in the 10 years on the continents and in the world, even </info>
    <info>if the winds are sometimes bad. I don't know if this situation is able </info>
    <info>to explain something in my bad English, but in French it's something </info>
    <info>very clear as the winds are sometimes bad. And we are in this sequence </info>
    <info>today since several months. Even in the European Union, not only here </info>
    <info>or there.</info>
    <info>    These efforts are even more needed as we face new challenges in the </info>
    <info>multipolar world. I can only agree with these conclusions. I would like </info>
    <info>to use this opportunity to express my hopes that our cooperation in the </info>
    <info>areas in defense of peace, freedom, and democracy will continue for </info>
    <info>world stability.</info>
    <info>    Thank you. And excuse me for my bad English, but you seem to </info>
    <info>understand.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. Thank you so much. I will say, your English is so </info>
    <info>much better than my French. [Laughter.] So thank you. We appreciate </info>
    <info>that.</info>
    <info>    There were a number of issues that were just raised in terms of </info>
    <info>where we would see ourselves in the next 10 years on both sides of the </info>
    <info>Atlantic. I think what obstacles we would have to address--everything </info>
    <info>from the CLOUD Act to where the U.S. stands on a number of U.N. bodies </info>
    <info>regarding the Human Rights Council, as well some other multilateral </info>
    <info>agreements including climate change, and then, of course, our recent </info>
    <info>comments made at the NATO summit.</info>
    <info>    But before we actually turn things over to the audience, I will say </info>
    <info>one of the things that we didn't hear about just yet is actually Brexit </info>
    <info>and where we would--[laughs]--see ourselves in the next 10 years. And </info>
    <info>since we are lucky enough to have someone from the U.K. on the panel--</info>
    <info>and I apologize, I know you must get this question all the time--but </info>
    <info>just given what we see in the next months where----</info>
    <info>    MEP Moraes. So I got the boring first question and then I get the </info>
    <info>Brexit question. Thanks, Mischa, very much. [Laughter.] My colleagues </info>
    <info>get all the really cerebral, sophisticated questions. I get what are </info>
    <info>you doing here and tell us about Brexit. [Laughter.] Thank you very </info>
    <info>much. I'll see how I can make this really imaginative as well. So let's </info>
    <info>see how I can weave this into something interesting. Yes. Anyway, what </info>
    <info>do you want to know about Brexit? We're leaving. [Laughter.] So, yes, </info>
    <info>OK, moving on.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. [Laughs.] I'll ask you two questions. So what does </info>
    <info>that mean for the U.K. in 10 years, what does it mean for the EU in 10 </info>
    <info>years? And then I'll even say, most recently, what will it mean for the </info>
    <info>European Parliament next year?</info>
    <info>    MEP Moraes. Yes, like I said, we're leaving. [Laughter.] So--well, </info>
    <info>you never know. [Laughs.] Oh, that's being recorded.</info>
    <info>    Well, yes, it's a bit of a mess. And one of the reasons it's a mess </info>
    <info>is because, first of all, the European Union is a good thing, as people </info>
    <info>are learning. And the process of leaving, as always happens when one </info>
    <info>leaves, is you start to understand what the good things are about your </info>
    <info>partner and how you might miss them. Well, that's certainly what </info>
    <info>happened between me and my partner. And we're still together, so </info>
    <info>everything's fine. I'm just making that very personal.</info>
    <info>    But the issue about Brexit in terms of the issues that Nathalie and </info>
    <info>Michal have been discussing are actually quite serious ones. If you </info>
    <info>think about, for example, the issues at stake, if you look at security, </info>
    <info>for example, it was always thought that we could just walk into Brexit </info>
    <info>and there would be an easy kind of accommodation between what is a </info>
    <info>major economy, the United Kingdom, a major security asset country like </info>
    <info>the United Kingdom, with some of the most mature intelligence and </info>
    <info>defense assets anywhere in the world, and the European Union. And that </info>
    <info>would be easy to do. Remember, the United Kingdom is part of Five Eyes </info>
    <info>with the United States, just to give you one aspect which is also of </info>
    <info>interest to my colleagues here.</info>
    <info>    And we see that this is not the case. And it's not the case because </info>
    <info>the European Union is a very sophisticated and added-value concept, </info>
    <info>which has both benefited Europe and it's benefited the United States. </info>
    <info>Why? Because what has happened over that period is that the security </info>
    <info>aspect has become a more complicated and important issue. For example, </info>
    <info>data has led it. So when you deal with terrorists, very often you're </info>
    <info>not dealing with terrorists through hot pursuit and enforcement and </info>
    <info>machines. You're dealing with it through information, data. Europol, </info>
    <info>one of the most successful agencies anywhere in the world--it's a very </info>
    <info>small agency but it's a huge added value--is not an enforcement agency. </info>
    <info>It's an intelligence agency. But it's so successful because it takes </info>
    <info>its intelligence capacity very seriously and it's good at it. And it </info>
    <info>shares its information very well and it has the correct priorities.</info>
    <info>    Now, the United Kingdom, through Brexit, will want to share in </info>
    <info>Europol afterwards. But because of the legal constraints, the U.K. will </info>
    <info>be a third country. That will be tough. Now, that also has an impact on </info>
    <info>the United States. Why? Because the U.K. is in Five Eyes. And it's </info>
    <info>difficult to divide what is happening in the European Union from what </info>
    <info>is happening in intelligence sharing generally, because these are not </info>
    <info>divisions that people can make very easily. So Brexit has all sorts of </info>
    <info>difficult and unintended consequences because the European Union's </info>
    <info>development has happened in such a way to impinge on the real needs and </info>
    <info>values of the transatlantic relationship.</info>
    <info>    What Britain got from the European Union was a magnification of its </info>
    <info>role and its relationship with the United States, not a diminution. And </info>
    <info>I think people are realizing that now. It's a less-special relationship </info>
    <info>when you're on your own because you don't have the added value, you </info>
    <info>don't have the economies of scale. So, what we had in our intelligence </info>
    <info>services and our defense assets, and so on, don't have the </info>
    <info>magnification by not being in the European Union. So, the other thing </info>
    <info>is the simple question of a security treaty with the EU legal </info>
    <info>constraints on our access to databases. We'll need adequacy agreements </info>
    <info>and so on.</info>
    <info>    So the European Union, as you may have gathered from what I'm </info>
    <info>saying, is a good thing. But it's a good thing for the United States. </info>
    <info>And the United States is a good thing for us. What will constrain </info>
    <info>that--and Brexit has thrown everything into sharp relief--is an </info>
    <info>understanding that the relationship must be nurtured. And that means </info>
    <info>that the United States is much more than who might be president today. </info>
    <info>It is a long-lasting relationship where the fundamentals need to be </info>
    <info>nurtured.</info>
    <info>    So today, when we look at the issues that Nathalie has raised, one </info>
    <info>of the things that we have to get very much right are the big issues of </info>
    <info>safety, how we keep our people safe, counter terrorism, and then the </info>
    <info>big issue of how that has managed to impinge on the areas of commercial </info>
    <info>transfers of data. Because data is data, but it can be transferred for </info>
    <info>many reasons.</info>
    <info>    And there are two big reasons--one is security. So, when we </info>
    <info>travel--and I want to mention this in the context of Brexit because </info>
    <info>it's to illustrate how important these areas are for this generation. </info>
    <info>And there are many young people here, so this is the future. And this </info>
    <info>is the difference between 1975 and today.</info>
    <info>    The qualitative difference is that the future will be about massive </info>
    <info>data transfers both within domestic countries--there won't be the high </info>
    <info>streets that we have been used to; everything will be online--but </info>
    <info>between countries there will be massive commercial transfers. But if </info>
    <info>there are security exemptions and so on to these transfers, of course </info>
    <info>we have to sort out what they have to be. And then we have to </info>
    <info>understand security data transfers to ensure that we are keeping people </info>
    <info>safe. Of course, we have to ensure that our privacy is protected when </info>
    <info>that happens--hence, the Umbrella Agreement, hence all of the </info>
    <info>international agreements that we have between us.</info>
    <info>    Now, you mentioned Brexit. Of course, when a country leaves two </info>
    <info>things happen, when a big country leaves, particularly. One is, we </info>
    <info>realize the importance of many of these things. Passenger name records </info>
    <info>was an agreement which the United Kingdom was very much leading and </info>
    <info>wanted. And of course, no doubt will keep involved in. But many other </info>
    <info>agreements, perhaps not. So, when you look at the headlines--there are </info>
    <info>headlines and then there are the realities of what it means to leave </info>
    <info>such a unique and extraordinary association as the European Union. </info>
    <info>There's nothing like it in the world. It is quite a unique association </info>
    <info>of countries. And I think the security aspect of that was very </info>
    <info>underestimated. And at some point, there will be an impact on the </info>
    <info>United States because of that.</info>
    <info>    We'll see how the Brexit story goes. The Brexit story is not </info>
    <info>finished. As you're all keen students of politics, you will be </info>
    <info>watching. You probably know more about it than I do. I've been here in </info>
    <info>Washington without wi-fi. You probably have access to wi-fi. But I'd </info>
    <info>like to know a bit more about what happened in the last hour, for </info>
    <info>example. It's an hour-by-hour story--our Brexit story. So let's see </info>
    <info>what's happened so far. But there are only negatives for the U.K. of </info>
    <info>Brexit, because we are the ones who are leaving. Getting a deal not in </info>
    <info>the conventional sense. We are leaving, and the terms are with the 27. </info>
    <info>And I think this was the big, big, big problem about the idea, that </info>
    <info>there would be some kind of equal negotiation, which was never to be </info>
    <info>the case.</info>
    <info>    And I think, as far as the United States is concerned, the United </info>
    <info>States wanted the U.K. to stay within the European Union. I think that </info>
    <info>was a cross-party sense and analysis, if we remember the history of </info>
    <info>Brexit. Whether you were a Democrat, whether you were a Republican, </info>
    <info>whether you were independent, you tended to think that it would be a </info>
    <info>good thing if the United Kingdom stayed within the EU. And I think </info>
    <info>people would tend to think that still. I don't think there are many </info>
    <info>people who think that's not a good idea. I think there is one person </info>
    <info>who thinks it's a good idea. But I think the broad swath of opinion is </info>
    <info>probably not the case. And I think there's plenty of evidence now to </info>
    <info>show that.</info>
    <info>    There are people who like Brexit, by the way. You may have noticed </info>
    <info>I'm not one of them. So does that answer your question about Brexit? </info>
    <info>Good.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. So--and I think we could easily take all of today's </info>
    <info>time to discuss Brexit. But we won't. [Laughs.] I have a number of </info>
    <info>questions I do want to raise with the panel. But just given the time, I </info>
    <info>do want to turn to our audience, and also just let people know that we </info>
    <info>are still expecting Senator Wicker. He had a conflict and is coming </info>
    <info>from another meeting. So with that, we have a microphone that is going </info>
    <info>around. If you're interested in asking a question, please raise your </info>
    <info>hand. Please introduce yourself.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Hi. My name is Elias Passis [ph]. I work in Senator </info>
    <info>Duckworth's office.</info>
    <info>    I had a question regarding here in our Congress, there are a number </info>
    <info>of bills addressing beneficial ownership, illicit economies, and tax </info>
    <info>evasion. But with so many of the top earners in the world having stakes </info>
    <info>in economies across the transatlantic and elsewhere, I was wondering </info>
    <info>what kind of structures any of you have considered or see as being </info>
    <info>beneficial in making sure that illicit economies are something that we </info>
    <info>can address?</info>
    <info>    MEP Boni. Thank you very much. First, I would like to address and </info>
    <info>add something about Brexit. Could we imagine the situation that in the </info>
    <info>perspective of 3 years the delegation of the European Parliament will </info>
    <info>go to London and will discuss with the U.K. Parliament the Privacy </info>
    <info>Shield, as we are now discussing with the U.S.? Because it will--of </info>
    <info>course, I hope that the U.K. will keep the solutions which were </info>
    <info>approved in the European Union, but it's not so clear? So, Brexit </info>
    <info>creates many, many new challenges. And I think it will not be so good </info>
    <info>for our common future.</info>
    <info>    Coming back to some economic issues, I think that there is a big </info>
    <info>opportunity to create--when we are talking about data protection and </info>
    <info>personal data protection--to create the global reference point when we, </info>
    <info>European Union and U.S., also we are working with Japan and South Korea </info>
    <info>on some agreements on proper conditions for data flows. If we will </info>
    <info>create this reference point, I think it will be easier to discuss also </info>
    <info>with China and with Russia on those issues. So we need to make it </info>
    <info>together.</info>
    <info>    Second, when we are talking about artificial intelligence, the U.S. </info>
    <info>is much more advanced. But in the European Union we have started the </info>
    <info>work on it. This is the first step in investment, 1.5 billion euro. But </info>
    <info>on the other hand, we are discussing the ethical aspects of the </info>
    <info>functioning of artificial intelligence. We are discussing the future </info>
    <info>labor markets. We are discussing what interactions between humans and </info>
    <info>artificial intelligence will look like in the future. It requires some </info>
    <info>changes in education that require some new skills and solutions in the </info>
    <info>area of attitudes and competencies.</info>
    <info>    So, we need to be much more adaptable, if we will make it together, </info>
    <info>the European Union and the United States, I think that we will go </info>
    <info>forward. And when we are looking at China's program to be the first, to </info>
    <info>be the leader in 2025 in the area of artificial intelligence, I think, </info>
    <info>unfortunately without those considerations for ethical issues--I think </info>
    <info>it will be much stronger, it will be better for creating the strategy </info>
    <info>for artificial intelligence, which will be human-centered, because this </info>
    <info>is very important.</info>
    <info>    When we are talking about cybersecurity, in the European Union we </info>
    <info>are now working on cybersecurity act. What does it mean? That we are </info>
    <info>working on certification schemes and the model of shared responsibility </info>
    <info>between states, the companies or institutions responsible for critical </info>
    <info>infrastructure, but also all companies, including small and medium </info>
    <info>companies, and individuals, because this is some kind of cybersecurity </info>
    <info>hygiene which is needed also for us as individuals. If we make them </info>
    <info>together, and if standards important for certification schemes become </info>
    <info>common in the European Union and in the United States, both sides will </info>
    <info>benefit. On the one hand we will be much more secure, on the other </info>
    <info>hand, we will create our economic advances in that area.</info>
    <info>    So if I'm considering many, many issues, I think that there are </info>
    <info>common goals. And we need to go in this way, especially also when we </info>
    <info>will back commonly--the U.S. and European Union--to the track of the </info>
    <info>Paris Agreement, because this is an opportunity for us as humans to </info>
    <info>live in a better world. But on the other hand, this is an opportunity </info>
    <info>for businesses, yes? For a new model of development.</info>
    <info>    So the list is very long. And I think that beyond the linguistic </info>
    <info>problem, as it was presented yesterday by President Trump--beyond many </info>
    <info>tensions existing now, I think that we need to have this list and we </info>
    <info>need to start cooperation because the future belongs to us.</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    MEP Moraes. May I say one thing about what Michal said that's very, </info>
    <info>very important that he raised just now? It is that to underestimate the </info>
    <info>relationship between the European Union and the United States is </info>
    <info>perilous. He gave such an excellent example of artificial intelligence </info>
    <info>and the movements in that field that would expand in China. China will </info>
    <info>do it. China will do all of these things. But they will do them in a </info>
    <info>different way. And they will do them in a way which will have a set of </info>
    <info>different values. European Union values on security, on commercial </info>
    <info>transfer are different. There will be liberal democratic values </info>
    <info>underpinning them. And this is critical. And that's why Brexit's bad </info>
    <info>too, because you want to stay within this area of values. This creates </info>
    <info>better business, it creates better security, better counterterrorism, </info>
    <info>because it's underpinned by values.</info>
    <info>    Now, of course, there's a spectrum to that always. But China will </info>
    <info>do this. Other countries may go down different paths, but you really </info>
    <info>underestimate this to everyone's peril. And I think artificial </info>
    <info>intelligence and robotics are very good examples. And that's why the </info>
    <info>European Union is cooperating with South Korea and Japan. And it's why </info>
    <info>the United States does as well. So this relationship is so critical for </info>
    <info>that reason. And that's why we are more emotional about Brexit, because </info>
    <info>it should be within this incredibly important values arc, which should </info>
    <info>never be underestimated. And in the current context, it's why we feel </info>
    <info>the way we do about the relationship with the United States and the </info>
    <info>European Union.</info>
    <info>    MEP Griesbeck. [Through interpreter.] Well, just to add to what my </info>
    <info>two colleagues just said, I'm totally in agreement with them. And let </info>
    <info>me tell you that they are both coming from a different political angle </info>
    <info>than myself. They are from two different parties, and I'm from a third </info>
    <info>party. But on these--on these big lines, we basically have very similar </info>
    <info>views and a very similar approach. And we are in Europe with half a </info>
    <info>billion--500 million people--over there. And the United States, you are </info>
    <info>something like 300 million. And there's on the one hand the European </info>
    <info>Union and the United States, and on the other hand there's China.</info>
    <info>    And what distinguishes us from China is the set of values and </info>
    <info>principles that guide us. And despite the small differences between us </info>
    <info>and the United States, there's a dividing line between us and the </info>
    <info>United States on the one hand and China on the other hand. We have an </info>
    <info>ethical structure on which we are elaborating and on which we are </info>
    <info>developing. And, yes, to answer your question on tax evasion, for </info>
    <info>example, obviously we are doing similar--we are doing similar efforts. </info>
    <info>But we are doing them on values and the rule of law and on principles. </info>
    <info>And fine for China that they are developing, but they are developing on </info>
    <info>a very different basis. And from a--and starting--setting off from a </info>
    <info>different set of rules. So just to tell you that here we are, very much </info>
    <info>on the same page and very much in agreement, the three of us.</info>
    <info>    [Speaks in English.] Excellent, Michael. He is from Germany. </info>
    <info>[Laughter.] Excellent.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Speiser. One wouldn't believe that, huh? [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Hi. I'm Erika Schlager from the Helsinki Commission </info>
    <info>staff.</info>
    <info>    First of all, I'd like to thank you for the excellent presentations </info>
    <info>that you've made this morning. The transatlantic relationship has </info>
    <info>really been built on a comprehensive concept of security, one that </info>
    <info>includes democracy and human rights. So I was particularly interested, </info>
    <info>and welcomed the comments that we heard this morning, about the </info>
    <info>challenges at present regarding the rule of law and independence of the </info>
    <info>judiciary. Now, you may know that members of Congress from both sides </info>
    <info>of the aisle, particularly in the Senate, have spoken to some of these </info>
    <info>issues, have written to the president and to the secretary of state </info>
    <info>about the importance of democracy and human rights in U.S. foreign </info>
    <info>policy. My question for you is, do you have suggestions on how Congress </info>
    <info>can constructively engage and reinforce democracy and human rights in </info>
    <info>the region at this juncture?</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    MEP Boni. Thank you very much for this question. And I want to </info>
    <info>thank to the representatives of Congress and the Senate, because the </info>
    <info>activity of those two chambers and the activity of many American </info>
    <info>institutions, the judges' associations and so on, is very high.</info>
    <info>    And it's very important in Poland, when we have this kind of </info>
    <info>international support for keeping the independence of the judiciary </info>
    <info>system, for example, because it means that it is not only a topic for </info>
    <info>political internal battles, but that this is something more, yes? And I </info>
    <info>think it's very important for this part of society who is fighting for </info>
    <info>those values.</info>
    <info>    And I think that because this is an ongoing story, so if you will </info>
    <info>be involved all the time and comment, and send some information, some </info>
    <info>suggestions, organize some pressure in a positive sense, I think that </info>
    <info>it will be very, very useful for all of us in Poland because one of the </info>
    <info>dimensions of the populistic model of the governing is to polarize </info>
    <info>society. So we have two societies in our country. This part of society </info>
    <info>who is involved in activities of the ruling party--this is some kind of </info>
    <info>religious community, my view is that it is not the civil society. This </info>
    <info>is the religious community, without any critical thinking about some </info>
    <info>solutions.</info>
    <info>    But on the other hand, we have people who are fighting for </info>
    <info>democracy, who want to keep the independence of the judiciary system. </info>
    <info>They are attacked very often. We have no public media. Public media is </info>
    <info>TV propaganda, and so on and so on. So your voice is very, very, very </info>
    <info>important. And I want to just--to add just one point. When we start in </info>
    <info>the autumn in Poland and next year when we have many elections--local </info>
    <info>and regional elections this year, elections to the European Parliament </info>
    <info>next year, and the election to the Polish Parliament next year, and the </info>
    <info>presidential election in 2020.</info>
    <info>    And we are organizing some kind--which is WWW, in Polish. But it </info>
    <info>means volunteers for free elections--for fair elections. Because we </info>
    <info>want to avoid the situation in which there will be some, delicately </info>
    <info>speaking, misunderstandings--[laughs]--with results of the elections. </info>
    <info>And I think if the civil society, Helsinki Commission, some </info>
    <info>representatives of Congress and Senate will be involved in keeping the </info>
    <info>fair elections, the [patron ?] of this action is--[inaudible]. So I </info>
    <info>think it's also visible to our American colleagues that this is one of </info>
    <info>the key person fighting for freedom in this part of Europe. So be with </info>
    <info>us and be in touch together.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. As we're waiting for the microphone to get to our </info>
    <info>next question, I did want to raise a question about the demographic </info>
    <info>change that we're seeing in Europe. And, again, is this is one of the </info>
    <info>other issues that we should be focusing on? A number of people noted </info>
    <info>that the team in France, for example, that brought home the World Cup </info>
    <info>was quite diverse. And so there have been questions of whether or not </info>
    <info>there's a way to capitalize on increasing diversity in Europe. And I'm </info>
    <info>actually just really pleased, again, to have you here today, because </info>
    <info>you've been leading on the blue card initiative for Europe, that's </info>
    <info>looking at Europe's changing work force. And I was hoping you could </info>
    <info>talk a little bit about where things are with that and if there's </info>
    <info>anything specifically relevant to this high skilled effort that can </info>
    <info>also be utilized with the newer migrant and refugee populations that </info>
    <info>we're seeing in Europe.</info>
    <info>    MEP Moraes. It's interesting that you're talking about the legal </info>
    <info>channels for coming to the European Union. So interestingly, nobody </info>
    <info>wants the blue card, which kind of tells you where that is. It tells </info>
    <info>you where the United States is at the moment and tells you where the </info>
    <info>European Union is.</info>
    <info>    But what is happening in the world is that Western countries, the </info>
    <info>liberal democracies that we're talking about, are under relative </info>
    <info>migration pressure. Mr. Boni talked about climate change, we talk about </info>
    <info>refugee hot spots, Syria, Libya, what proceeded it, Iran, Iraq, </info>
    <info>Afghanistan, the refugee crises of that period. Although, in the </info>
    <info>Mediterranean the numbers are, in fact, falling. But the numbers that </info>
    <info>are coming are heavily politicized, as you well know when you watch the </info>
    <info>news.</info>
    <info>    So there's migration pressure, but at the same time--and I don't </info>
    <info>know exactly the demographics in the United States--but at the same </info>
    <info>time in the European Union there's a very heavily aging, ethnically </info>
    <info>white population. So you have even in countries like Italy, Spain with </info>
    <info>relatively high density, you still have aging populations and the need </info>
    <info>for work in particular sectors. So you've got this conundrum. But </info>
    <info>migration is not a simple thing, particularly in European societies, </info>
    <info>post-colonial societies. Ethnicity, identity, race is a huge issue when </info>
    <info>you have powers that literally were colonial powers, and still are. </info>
    <info>Some European Union countries still have colonies. And so the </info>
    <info>psychology of this is extremely important.</info>
    <info>    Each European Union country has had a different relationship with </info>
    <info>immigration. And immigration has been shaped in relation to those </info>
    <info>countries. So that's the underlying tension below all of this. Those </info>
    <info>countries without those colonial pasts, those who have had fewer </info>
    <info>colonies--Germany, for example--have a different immigration passage. </info>
    <info>Those countries that have few migrants and have been accession </info>
    <info>countries in 2004, like Poland and Hungary, have had a different </info>
    <info>migration passage. But France and the United Kingdom, colonial powers, </info>
    <info>their migration history is shaped by that. And then, of course, their </info>
    <info>constitutions have shaped it. So in France the republican notion, </info>
    <info>everyone is French. The United Kingdom, everyone is kind of British. </info>
    <info>[Laughs.] Sort of. So this is a complicated thing.</info>
    <info>    Then this makes it difficult for the European Union to then have a </info>
    <info>migration policy, because you're dealing with the very, very difficult </info>
    <info>issues of sovereignty, identity, of citizenship, which are very, very </info>
    <info>defined. However, the European Union has an external border. The </info>
    <info>European Union needs to have the integrity of the external border and </info>
    <info>the freedom of movement within. And that's the big paradox. So this has </info>
    <info>been tested very heavily in recent years. And to have a settlement--</info>
    <info>because we talk about human rights, liberal democracies--it has been </info>
    <info>tested heavily. And the first thing, to be positive, many good things </info>
    <info>have happened. Many countries have stepped up to the plate, have tried </info>
    <info>to do the right thing. Germany being a good example, Sweden, and other </info>
    <info>countries trying to do the right thing. Many other countries have been </info>
    <info>doing good things, but they're not being identified as doing so, </info>
    <info>because the whole issue has been caricaturized.</info>
    <info>    So this is a very big subject, as you can see from how I'm </info>
    <info>describing it. But it should not be simplified. The big issues now that </info>
    <info>we have to deal with are that we have to have a managed migration </info>
    <info>policy for the European Union without us descending into populism and </info>
    <info>moving to a situation where the fear of migration dictates how </info>
    <info>governments are elected. And in my view--because I shouldn't have a </info>
    <info>view on the United States, you should have a view on the United </info>
    <info>States--but once leaders pursue the notion of fear of migration rather </info>
    <info>than management of migration, then you are descending into the </info>
    <info>situation we had in the 1920s, fear of invasion, fear of an enemy </info>
    <info>rather than understanding that you should manage migration for the good </info>
    <info>of everyone, for a win-win situation. And, second, understanding what </info>
    <info>migration means. There are certain push factors and certain pull </info>
    <info>factors. And the population should really be truthfully told what they </info>
    <info>are and why people are moving and what their migration needs are.</info>
    <info>    We haven't reached this point yet. And certainly the European </info>
    <info>Union, there's been a shock to that. So today for example, the European </info>
    <info>Union doesn't have much of a legal migration policy because that's in </info>
    <info>retreat. But that doesn't mean we don't have the capacity to do it. The </info>
    <info>European Union has managed to do many things. And by the way, I would </info>
    <info>say about the European Union, people talk about the end of the European </info>
    <info>Union in many phases all the time. And it always is resilient. It </info>
    <info>always comes back and has a solution. And I'm very optimistic that even </info>
    <info>in this very difficult area, we will find solutions, we will manage </info>
    <info>things, because we're talking about sophisticated countries that can do </info>
    <info>this. And there are political, progressive forces that can try and </info>
    <info>ensure that we get a good solution, but it won't be easy. And I'm glad </info>
    <info>I'm getting older and it's all up to you. No, it's not, you're </info>
    <info>American. But the younger generation will have to grapple with this.</info>
    <info>    Climate change, climate change refugees, I have to say that much of </info>
    <info>the movement--as we saw when we were in Lebanon recently--developing </info>
    <info>countries have the overwhelming majority of refugees, not Europe or the </info>
    <info>United States. That's the reality. But if you say to somebody in the </info>
    <info>European Union or the United States that's the case, it's meaningless </info>
    <info>if they switch on Fox News and everyone's telling them that they're </info>
    <info>being invaded by Mexicans and there needs to be a wall. So it's the </info>
    <info>same in the European Union. If Salvini in Italy is telling them that, </info>
    <info>look, we need to do this because he's under pressure. What's more </info>
    <info>difficult is if somebody in another country, where there's virtually no </info>
    <info>migration, tells them that they're being invaded--so Hungary, for </info>
    <info>example. And that's the big problem. This is a huge issue for us. But </info>
    <info>we can manage this.</info>
    <info>    Why do we know we can manage it? Because history has been here--we </info>
    <info>have been here before. And we need to learn the lessons of history. And </info>
    <info>I think this is a profound issue. It's a management issue. It's an </info>
    <info>organizational issue. And by the way, when we talk about the </info>
    <info>transatlantic relationship, there's some symmetry here between the two.</info>
    <info>    Can I just say this one final thing on migration? It's quite </info>
    <info>interesting, but a few years ago--both in the United States and the </info>
    <info>European Union--people said that migration was a non-issue. I remember </info>
    <info>that. It was about 22, 23 years ago. Secondary migration was the only </info>
    <info>thing. Everyone said immigration doesn't exist anymore as an issue in </info>
    <info>the United States. But all that existed in the United States as it was </info>
    <info>becoming more ethnically diverse. But immigration was not an issue. </info>
    <info>Refugees were not an issue for the United States.</info>
    <info>    Funnily enough, it's a big issue today, and it's the same in the </info>
    <info>European Union. And there are many, many factors determining that, but </info>
    <info>we have to get through this. And the other thing is that it's a global </info>
    <info>issue, not an issue for the Western liberal democracies. We are caught </info>
    <info>in it because we don't want those people to come. And yet, we need some </info>
    <info>of them to do the work that no one else wants to do. And then as Mischa </info>
    <info>said, we need some of the skilled ones to do the more skilled work that </info>
    <info>we want them to do. So in my country, the National Health Service would </info>
    <info>collapse tomorrow without the migrant labor that we have, or the </info>
    <info>European Union free movement that we need. So this is the big paradox </info>
    <info>of migration. But it's probably the biggest single challenge that we </info>
    <info>have in the European Union, which almost like dwarfs the economy which </info>
    <info>seems to be ticking along nicely.</info>
    <info>    And just a final point, the countries that complain most about </info>
    <info>migration have got the highest economic growth in the European Union </info>
    <info>today. That's just a really interesting point to mention.</info>
    <info>    MEP Griesbeck. May I say a few words about the blue card and the </info>
    <info>conclusion from our President Claude Moraes?</info>
    <info>    [Continues through interpreter.] Just to add to what Claude said, </info>
    <info>on the blue card, Claude Moraes, our president, used to be the </info>
    <info>rapporteur on this file. And he was in charge of this file. And I want </info>
    <info>to congratulate him for the great work that he has put into it, and the </info>
    <info>progress that had been made. A blue card would have been one way of </info>
    <info>opening routes for migrants--legal routes for migrants to come to </info>
    <info>Europe. And that would have been a good thing. Now it is because of the </info>
    <info>reluctance of some member states and their hypocrisy, in a way, that </info>
    <info>this dossier has not seen the light yet, or at least not seen the light </info>
    <info>in the way that it should be.</info>
    <info>    Blue card would have been also an important issue because we are </info>
    <info>actually facing here two major problems in Europe. One is the problem </info>
    <info>of migration. And this problem of migration can basically cause us harm </info>
    <info>and bring down Europe if we are not able to provide for the good--for </info>
    <info>the good replies to it. And the blue card, in a way, would have been </info>
    <info>one way of a good response to that. And on the other hand, that was the </info>
    <info>question of Mischa from the start, the demographic development and the </info>
    <info>demographic change of Europe. If you look at Europe in a couple of </info>
    <info>years from now it will be a continent of gray hair, like myself. </info>
    <info>[Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    And as paradox as it might sound, so on this one hand this </info>
    <info>migration issue, and at the same time we need something in terms of </info>
    <info>migration if we don't want to become the continent of gray hair. So </info>
    <info>that is a very big issue. And these are the two challenges that we are </info>
    <info>currently facing.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. Okay. So we're going to do a really quick lighting </info>
    <info>round to see if we can end in 5 minutes. And--[laughs]--and so with </info>
    <info>that we'll take the two questions here.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Dan Stoller from Bloomberg.</info>
    <info>    Just a quick question. With the growing political tension between </info>
    <info>the U.S. and the EU, and the EU's appetite for more data transfer pacts </info>
    <info>with Japan and South Korea, do you think there will be more data </info>
    <info>transfer agreements with other nations outside of the U.S. going </info>
    <info>forward? Is there a larger appetite for that?</info>
    <info>    Questioner. I'm Robert Hand. I'm a colleague of Mischa's at the </info>
    <info>Helsinki Commission. And my portfolio is the Western Balkans, which is </info>
    <info>a region where the United States and the European Union has had to </info>
    <info>coordinate policies. In fact, at many of our previous hearings and </info>
    <info>briefings we have often had an EU official or even a member of the </info>
    <info>European Parliament come to talk about policy responses to the Balkans.</info>
    <info>    If I were to present U.S. policy in its more simplistic form, and </info>
    <info>say it's to follow the European lead, to support Europe in its approach </info>
    <info>to the Western Balkans, how would you react? How confident are you in </info>
    <info>Europe's ability to lead in the Balkans, particularly given the </info>
    <info>problems with European leadership in the 1990s? And what </info>
    <info>recommendations would you make for U.S. engagement with Europe in that </info>
    <info>region that is knocking on the EU door right now?</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. So, and I'll say the last question I want to add to </info>
    <info>the lightning round--and I apologize because I'm going to have to cut </info>
    <info>you off--is that there's been a lot of talk about security issues </info>
    <info>emanating from both Russia and China. Yet, there are a number of </info>
    <info>European countries, as well as our country, that are currently doing a </info>
    <info>lot of business with China in particular, and also looking to do more </info>
    <info>business with both in the future. And so I think the question emanating </info>
    <info>from that is whether or not there's a scenario where both China and </info>
    <info>Russia can actually become more credible partners on security with the </info>
    <info>United States.</info>
    <info>    And so, with that, I will quickly turn to the panel for 1-minute </info>
    <info>answers on these three questions that were just posed.</info>
    <info>    MEP Moraes. Just on the Bloomberg colleague's question about the </info>
    <info>adequacy agreements and the relationships--I mean, our committee will </info>
    <info>be going to South Korea in October, and we've just been to Japan. And </info>
    <info>our role is on the adequacy agreement in relation to the trade </info>
    <info>agreement. So the answer is absolutely yes, we're seeing adequacy with </info>
    <info>these countries. I met with the South Korean equivalent of the </info>
    <info>information commissioner body a couple of weeks ago. And the point is </info>
    <info>that they are extremely keen. When we meet them, they're extremely keen </info>
    <info>to seek this kind of equivalency, because they understand the need for </info>
    <info>kind of frictionless data transfers. So they're building relationships </info>
    <info>for the future, not just for the trade agreement. And they understand </info>
    <info>exactly what is happening in the European Union. I know this is fast, </info>
    <info>but understand we're modernizing our data protection laws, and again, </info>
    <info>you've got liberal economic space. But you've got rules which are now </info>
    <info>tried and tested. And I think that's been really good.</info>
    <info>    Why are we doing it? We are doing the adequacy part. It's not just </info>
    <info>about privacy, it's also the commercial side. So absolutely yes, this </info>
    <info>is an exciting area. And I think yes, the U.S. should be aware of that, </info>
    <info>that we are doing that. And it's successful because we concluded the </info>
    <info>Japan trade agreement just recently. And we're quite excited to be part </info>
    <info>of that. I don't know, Mr. Boni might--and, of course, he had mentioned </info>
    <info>artificial intelligence, robotics, and so on. All of these areas--for </info>
    <info>example, Japan is hugely interested in that. So, the answer is yes.</info>
    <info>    MEP Boni. I know we are sort of the beginning of conversation </info>
    <info>negotiations with Singapore on data flows. There are many companies </info>
    <info>installed in Singapore. So I think it will be very, very important from </info>
    <info>the economic point of view. And also, we are talking about Canada, </info>
    <info>because it should be also recognized. And after that, we need to make </info>
    <info>an order of the--[inaudible].</info>
    <info>    This year in May, in the European summit in Sofia, we focused on </info>
    <info>establishing the strategy for the Balkans country's development. And I </info>
    <info>think it was very, very important. It was multidimensional, focused on </info>
    <info>many areas related to political issues, to fight against corruption, </info>
    <info>but also to support and to help those countries in the problems of </info>
    <info>depopulation, because it's a real challenge for those countries. We </info>
    <info>have discussed also about digital issues and making some special </info>
    <info>agreements and also using European money in the new infrastructure, </info>
    <info>making the accessibility to the internet much more open and for </info>
    <info>everybody.</info>
    <info>    And Serbia is the one country for which the commission said, okay, </info>
    <info>2025 could be the year in which it this country will be a member of the </info>
    <info>European Union. And what is important is solving the problem of the </info>
    <info>name of Macedonia, is I think it's also opened the further steps. My </info>
    <info>personal view is that now for the European Union, from a political </info>
    <info>point of view, Balkan countries are much more important than the </info>
    <info>eastern partnership. But of course, the eastern partnership is </info>
    <info>crucial--Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia having the association </info>
    <info>agreement, some distance to go for Armenia and Azerbaijan. Of course, </info>
    <info>there are many problems with Belarus. But I think that Balkan countries </info>
    <info>are the main focus.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. And MEP Griesbeck, just on whether Russia and China </info>
    <info>can be credible counterterrorism and security partners for the U.S. and </info>
    <info>EU.</info>
    <info>    MEP Griesbeck. [Through interpreter.] Right. To answer the question </info>
    <info>of the gentleman on the Balkans, I don't know what was really behind </info>
    <info>this question, if there's intention or if there is the thought behind </info>
    <info>whether the Balkans should join the European Union, yes or no. Let me </info>
    <info>answer the following--I know coming from a centrist, center political </info>
    <info>movement, being a member of the liberal group, I know that I'm a bit </info>
    <info>isolated here with my position. But here's the following look at </info>
    <info>Turkey. We opened accession discussions with Turkey and see where that </info>
    <info>has led us today. It was President Bush in 2004 who basically </info>
    <info>encouraged us to integrate Turkey into the European Union. And now </info>
    <info>relations with Turkey are rather deteriorating than improving. We have </info>
    <info>very, very, very difficult relations with Turkey. Look at the terrorist </info>
    <info>financing problems, look at the refugee problems. We have struck a deal </info>
    <info>with them that cost us 6 billion euros. And yet, this deal is subject </info>
    <info>to permanent blackmailing. So in case we wouldn't deliver, they would </info>
    <info>send more and more refugees.</info>
    <info>    And this is to say I was always one of those who voted against </info>
    <info>Turkey's accession to the European Union. And in the same way, I'm also </info>
    <info>opposing the idea of integrating more Western Balkan countries into the </info>
    <info>EU. They should benefit from a very advanced and privileged </info>
    <info>partnership, but for the time being they should not be members of the </info>
    <info>EU. Why? Because the European Union is much more than just an economic </info>
    <info>platform. It's a political entity. It's an entity of shared values and </info>
    <info>ideas. And we are currently in a phase where we first need to deepen </info>
    <info>our integration with the member states that we have before we can </info>
    <info>basically go for further enlargement of the European Union. If we would </info>
    <info>go on and just enlarge the European Union, we would just run around </info>
    <info>like a duck without a head. And we first need to basically make our </info>
    <info>minds up where we want to go with this European Union that we are </info>
    <info>currently having before we ask more members to join us. And I know this </info>
    <info>is not a very popular position. And I know I'm not in the majority </info>
    <info>there with my views, but I wanted to share them with you.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Thompson. Well, thank you all very much for such an amazing </info>
    <info>panel, following such a long trip from Europe, I'm certain with very </info>
    <info>little sleep. We know that officials on both sides were taking notes on </info>
    <info>everything that you said in preparation for the July 25th meeting that </info>
    <info>will take place between Presidents Trump and Juncker. And so, with </info>
    <info>that, we thank everyone else.</info>
    <info>    Senator Wicker sends his apologies. He actually got tied up with </info>
    <info>Senate business. And so, we're hoping that there might be another </info>
    <info>opportunity for the delegation to connect with him, and with that, I </info>
    <info>thank all of you.</info>
    <info>    Thank you. [Applause.]</info>
    <info>    [Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the briefing was adjourned.]</info>
