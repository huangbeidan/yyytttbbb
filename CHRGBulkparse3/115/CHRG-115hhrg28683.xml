    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in 
room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Bruce 
Westerman [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Westerman, Gohmert, Labrador, 
Radewagen, Bergman, Johnson, Bishop (ex officio), McEachin, 
Gallego, Huffman, Soto, and Grijalva (ex officio).
    Also Present: Representatives Lamborn, Gosar, Napolitano, 
Beyer, Torres, Barragan, Gomez, and Vela.
    Mr. Westerman. The Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations will come to order.
    The Subcommittee is meeting today to hear testimony on the 
costs of denying Border Patrol access: our environment and 
security. I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from 
Arizona, Mr. Gosar; the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Lamborn; 
the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Napolitano; the gentleman 
from Virginia, Mr. Beyer; the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. 
Torres; the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Barragan; the 
gentleman from California, Mr. Gomez; and the gentleman from 
Texas, Mr. Vela, be allowed to sit with the Committee and 
participate in the hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at 
hearings are limited to the Chairman, the Ranking Minority 
Member, and the Vice Chair. This will allow us to hear from our 
witnesses sooner and help Members keep to their schedules. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that all other Members' 
opening statements be made part of the hearing record, if they 
are submitted to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5 p.m. today.
    Without objection, so ordered.

    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS</opening>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Seventy-five pounds of marijuana, almost
$8,000 of brown heroin, 5 illegal border crossers with unknown 
intentions, and 11 more illegals who got away. In the course of 
just one evening 2 weeks ago, that is what I witnessed along a 
small portion of the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Nationally, in the past few months alone, Border Patrol has 
already apprehended more than 100,000 border violators, seized 
over 200,000 pounds of marijuana, 113 pounds of heroin, and 196 
pounds of the deadly opioid, fentanyl. These numbers do not 
even account for the seizures of drugs at ports of entries. And 
we should keep in mind that these statistics only represent 
what we have caught. Border Patrol uses estimates, so God only 
knows what we have really missed coming through our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Westerman">We are dealing with professional drug and human traffickers 
who are organized, well-manned, and sophisticated. During an 
aerial tour on my visit to the border, we spotted scout 
locations hidden in the rocky mountain tops on the U.S. side of 
the border. These difficult to detect spots are used by 
criminals to monitor and communicate Border Patrol's every move 
on the ground to guide smugglers away from our agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Westerman">You see the display there. In one of these particular 
areas, you can see in the circle there, is actually a solar 
panel that was packed in that is used to charge cell phones and 
radios so that these scouts can communicate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Westerman">[Slide.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Westerman">You can see from these photos that these scouts are 
prepared to camp out for weeks or months. They have gotten so 
advanced that they have even set up these solar panels. Aside 
from the garbage that they leave behind, at least they are 
being environmentally conscious by using alternative energy 
sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Border security is a complex and daunting issue that 
affects our lives and public safety. One thing, however, was 
abundantly clear on my trip with Chairman Bishop to the border. 
We need to ensure that we give our law enforcement agents 
appropriate access to the Federal lands they patrol to keep us 
safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Take, for example, the Tucson Sector's 262 miles of border, 
86 percent of which is on Federal or tribal lands. Of the 
approximate 1,900 miles on the southern border, about 35 
percent is on Federal or tribal lands. With vast amounts of 
Federal land, accompanied by an array of environmental laws, 
our Border Patrol agents face statutory restraints in addition 
to the physical challenges and dangers of their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Meanwhile, cross-border violators are not just comprised of 
families and children, they are also human traffickers, drug 
smugglers, and violent criminals. While our agents spend time 
seeking and waiting for authorization from Federal land 
managers to make sure environmental impacts are addressed, 
criminals trample through environmentally sensitive areas 
leaving tons of garbage and waste along their paths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Westerman">On Federal borderlands, it can take months or even years 
for Border Patrol to receive approval to maintain roads or 
install tactical infrastructure, such as communications relays, 
video surveillance towers, and radars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Westerman">After securing approval from Federal land managers, Border 
Patrol actions may be subject to the NEPA review process, 
causing further delays in operational deployment. Securing 
approval to build just a few miles of new roads on federally 
owned borderland, something agents we spoke to identified as 
particularly important in rugged, isolated terrain, can be a 
multiple-year process. These authorization requirements and 
permitting delays can have a crippling effect on border 
security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Westerman">During our visit to the Arizona border, one agent explained 
to us the tremendous bureaucratic delays Border Patrol can face 
to remediate or fill illicit tunnels used for drug smuggling. 
In one instance, we were told about a known tunnel left 
unfilled for months because of the presence of a threatened or 
endangered species. This is unacceptable, and I can guarantee 
that the drug cartels using the tunnel did not care about the 
welfare of that species.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Cartels and illegal immigrants don't wait for environmental 
assessments, they don't participate in Section 7 ESA 
consultations, and they don't follow Wilderness Act 
restrictions. High volumes of illegal border crossings do cause 
extensive environmental damage to our public lands by igniting 
costly wildfires, sometimes as diversionary tactics, and 
destroying species habitat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Westerman">In addition, safety concerns related to illegal 
immigration, drug smuggling, and even the murder of a park 
ranger have forced national monuments, forests, and wildlife 
refuges on the border to close to the public for extended 
periods of time. Denying public access betrays our promise to 
present and future generations to use and enjoy these lands as 
intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Cross-border violators take advantage of Border Patrol's 
lack of operational flexibility on Federal lands. We need to 
ensure that our environmental laws do not compromise Border 
Patrol's ability to detect, identify, track, and respond to 
cross-border violations.</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Westerman follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">This hearing gives us the opportunity to hear from people 
who have grappled with the problems of illegal immigration and 
an unsecured border. I look forward to their testimony and to 
continuing this Committee's work toward a solution.

trip with Chairman Bishop to the border--we need to ensure that we give 
our law enforcement agents appropriate access to the Federals lands 
they patrol to keep us safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">Take for example, the Tucson Sector's 262 border miles, 86 percent 
of which is on Federal or tribal lands. Of the approximate 1,900 miles 
on the southern border, about 35 percent is on Federal or tribal lands. 
With vast amounts of Federal land accompanied by an array of 
environmental laws, our Border Patrol agents face statutory restraints 
in addition to the physical challenges and dangers of their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">Meanwhile, cross-border violators are not just comprised of 
families and children. They are also human traffickers, drug smugglers, 
and violent criminals. While our agents spend time seeking and waiting 
for authorization from Federal land managers to make sure environmental 
impacts are addressed, criminals trample through environmentally 
sensitive areas leaving tons of garbage and waste along their paths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">On Federal borderlands, it can take months or even years for Border 
Patrol to receive approval to maintain roads or install tactical 
infrastructure, such as communications relays, video surveillance 
towers, and radars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">After securing approval from Federal land managers, Border Patrol 
actions may be subject to the NEPA review process, causing further 
delays in operational deployment. Securing approval to build just a few 
miles of new roads on federally owned borderland--something agents we 
spoke to identified as particularly important in rugged, isolated 
terrain--can be a multiple-year process. These authorization 
requirements and permitting delays can have a crippling effect on 
border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">During our visit to the Arizona border, one agent explained to us 
the tremendous bureaucratic delays Border Patrol can face to remediate, 
or fill, illicit tunnels used for drug smuggling. In one instance, we 
were told about a known tunnel left unfilled for months because of the 
presence of a threatened or endangered species. This is unacceptable, 
and I can guarantee that the drug cartel using that tunnel did not care 
about the welfare of that species.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">Cartels and illegal immigrants don't wait for Environmental 
Assessments, they don't participate in Section 7 ESA consultations, and 
they don't follow Wilderness Act restrictions. High volumes of illegal 
border crossings do cause extensive environmental damage to our public 
lands by igniting costly wildland fires--sometimes as diversionary 
tactics--and destroying species habitat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">In addition, safety concerns related to illegal immigration, drug 
smuggling, and even the murder of a park ranger, have forced national 
monuments, forests, and wildlife refuges on the border to close to the 
public for extended periods of time. Denying public access betrays our 
promise to present and future generations to use and enjoy these lands 
as intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">Cross-border violators take advantage of Border Patrol's lack of 
operational flexibility on Federal lands. We need to ensure that our 
environmental laws do not compromise Border Patrol's ability to detect, 
identify, track, and respond to cross-border violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Westerman ">This hearing gives us the opportunity to hear from people who have 
grappled with the problems of illegal immigration and an unsecured 
border. I look forward to their testimony and to continuing this 
Committee's work toward a solution.</paragraph>

safety laws, can be totally ignored when it comes to building a 
fence, or worse, the President's preposterous wall. If this 
sounds like an over-reach of power, that is because it is. In 
fact, it has been described as having greater reach than any 
other waiver authority in statute. Some legal experts have even 
deemed it unconstitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. McEachin">Despite the backlash and opposition to the waiver, however, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security has used it eight times, 
three of which were in the last 6 months of the Trump 
administration alone. Each time the Secretary has used the 
waiver, a whole slew of environmental and public safety laws 
have been tossed aside. The poster behind me names all 48 of 
the laws that have been waived. These laws are American rights. 
Rights to hold the government accountable. Rights to be

    <option>    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to each of our witnesses for

Ranking Member Grijalva for taking the time to join us and share his

    I would like to think we can do better than blaming the victim. 
This rhetoric vilifies real human beings who, many times, are risking 
their lives to reunite with their families or escape the violence of 
their countries. These are people seeking a better life, not seeking to 
break the law.
    When we finally stop blaming others, we can see that we have put

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THE HON. MIKE JOHNSON">    I yield back the remainder of my time. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
  Prepared Statement of the Hon. A. Donald McEachin, Ranking Member, 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you
for holding this critical hearing to explore the challenges 
faced by Border Patrol agents on Federal borderlands, as well 
as for your trip with Chairman Bishop earlier this month to 
visit the U.S.-Mexico border so we could get an update on the 
latest status of the Nation's border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Our government has placed the men and women who patrol our 
border, as well as the American citizens who live on or near 
the border, in a very difficult position. We all recognize 
that. As is all too often the case, Washington has created 
bureaucratic hurdles that have adversely impacted the Border 
Patrol agents' abilities to secure our southern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Johnson">While well intentioned, the Memorandum of Understanding 
that the Departments of Interior, Homeland Security, and 
Agriculture have entered into has created challenges and 
delayed Border Patrol agents' abilities to respond to illegal 
activity in Federal lands adjacent to the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Nearly 35.3 percent of the southern border runs along or 
through federally owned lands. Understanding the regulatory 
difficulties posed to Border Patrol officers due to the 
Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the 
Endangered Species Act, and other policies, illegal immigrants, 
human traffickers, and drug smugglers have targeted Federal 
lands to conduct their illicit activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Those illicit activities not only threaten the personal 
security of those who live along the border, but they have 
caused extensive ecological and environmental damage. Human 
waste, garbage, wildfires, tunnels, and the like have 
contributed to serious damage to wildlife habitats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Johnson">In a July 2011 Department of the Interior report, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service identified mass illegal immigration 
as a likely contributing factor in the 79 percent decline in 
the U.S. Sonoran pronghorn population between 2000 and 2002. 
This is at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, 79 percent, 
that is a massive impact to an endangered species that is found 
nowhere else in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Republican and Democrat administrations alike have 
highlighted the need to address this issue. For example, former 
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano wrote in a 
2009 letter to our Chairman, Mr. Bishop, ``While the U.S. 
Border Patrol recognizes the importance and value of wilderness 
area designations, they can have a significant impact on U.S. 
Border Patrol operations in border regions. This includes that 
these types of restrictions can impact the efficacy of 
operations and be a hindrance to the maintenance of officer 
safety.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Former Department of the Interior Secretary Salazar stated 
in 2010, ``We have seen that national security and 
environmental conservation are mutually supporting goals.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Johnson">It was with all of the above in mind that I introduced H.R. 
3593, the Securing Our Borders and Wilderness Act, which 
provides a statutory fix to an issue perpetuated by bureaucracy 
that, as we have said, is endangering both border security and 
our Federal lands. The bill allows for the Department of 
Homeland Security to conduct border security activities on 
Federal lands in a manner that, to the greatest extent 
possible, also protects wilderness areas. I look forward to 
highlighting how my bill will help to alleviate the impediments 
Border Patrol agents are facing at present, as well as the 
issues more broadly that we will be discussing today.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF THE HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THE HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA">    I now recognize the Ranking Minority Member of the Full 
Committee, Mr. Grijalva of Arizona, for an opening statement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate the
courtesy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">The Ranking Member has outlined my point of view on this 
hearing very well. I can't do much better. But there is an 
irony today. We are at the dawn of another senseless mass 
murder, 17 students and 15 wounded, some critically, in 
Florida, by a shooter with a semiautomatic AR-15.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">No doubt the House will pause today, and we should, to give 
our condolences and prayers to the victims and the families. 
Then there will be a lot of talk about mental health, and then 
we are going to ask people to be more vigilant, but nothing 
else. No legislative efforts to reduce gun violence. No 
prohibition of bump stocks. No universal background checks. 
Nothing. NRA will keep that from happening. They will talk 
about the sanctity of the Second Amendment and people's 
individual rights, and that will take precedent over reducing 
gun violence, that doesn't take the right from Americans to own 
and have guns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">But, on the contrary, the Majority of this Committee has--
wherever that legislation is to allow silencers on public land, 
to allow armor-piercing ammunition, to allow lead contamination 
once again to kill wildlife. And then today, we are discussing 
another set of rights. And the agenda that the Department of 
Homeland Security wants to have ultimate power to waive laws, 
ignore the public's right to know, and within the 100-mile 
zone, to ignore and handcuff due process and basic rights and 
constitutional guarantees that all Americans have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">I mention that because the question today is simply, does 
Homeland Security and Border Patrol need more power beyond the 
unprecedented authority that the Ranking Member outlined since 
2005 on our public lands, and within that 100-mile area, the 
authority that already exists relative to search and seizure, 
probable cause, that are handcuffed in that area? And we are 
asking about a unilateral authority to an agency with no 
review, no accountability, and no responsibility for any 
negative consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Besides the constriction of--this is all a tactical 
response, Mr. Chairman, a response in enforcement only 
justified by some level of political hysteria. Things like the 
mass invasion of MS-13 pouring over the border. Not true. The 
gateway in my district of drug smuggling and poisoning of 
America. That was a tweet that came from the Majority 
Committee, which described that part of my district. It was 
cute, but it was a lie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">And I can swear to you, Mr. Chairman, nowhere in my 
district is there a large pharmaceutical plant like Pfizer 
pumping out Oxy or other opioid-based drugs that have savaged 
America and made a huge profit for them, and continue to be 
overprescribed. To attack drug and human smuggling, those 
cartels and organized crimes need a strategic, focused, 
consistent, law enforcement response, not a pointless $25 
billion wall, 10,000 more private for-profit beds, waiving 
environmental laws, handcuffing basic individual and 
constitutional rights, and, fundamentally, Mr. Chairman, 
creating a distinct second class America in that part of the 
borderlands, that 100 miles of the southwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">This hearing comes at a time when we are engulfed in a 
debate about DACA, engulfed in a debate about what will happen 
with border security. This is not a time for exaggeration, 
untruths, generalizations, scare tactics that won't solve 
anything. And nor does the position that DHS has just taken to 
oppose any reasonable bipartisan Senate compromise on DACA, 
that shouldn't be the guide. They only endorse the most extreme 
pieces of legislation that have come out. No bipartisan, no 
compromise legislation will they tolerate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">I think what we are doing here today is handing over to an 
agency extrajudicial power. We are handing over to an agency a 
police function, turned into much more than that. The border 
region should not be under martial law, it should not feel like 
an occupied part of America, and should not be treated 
different than any other place. People in Utah, Montana, and 
Wyoming would not appreciate what is going on in the 
borderlands.</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Grijalva follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">I thank you for the witnesses today, and yield back.
 Prepared Statement of the Hon. Raul M. Grijalva, a Representative in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">Congress from the State of Arizona</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">The question for today is whether the Border Patrol needs even more 
power. What do they have now?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">The REAL ID Act of 2005 gave the Department of Homeland Security 
authority to waive ``all legal requirements'' that might impede the 
construction of barriers and roads. Think about that for a second. All 
legal requirements. On any land, public or private. That includes any 
Federal law that gives you and me the right to basic things like clean 
water, clean air, the right to participate in government decisions, and 
the right for native Americans to maintain their sacred burial grounds. 
It also includes any state and local law that might get in the way. The 
Congressional Research Service called the authority ``unprecedented.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">That waiver authority has had consequences for nearby communities. 
It has produced flooding, erosion, death of animals that endangered or 
threatened, and loss of economic opportunities like ecotourism in low 
income communities, for starters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">As anti-democratic, unprecedented and harmful as that waiver 
authority is, it is not enough for the Majority. They want to expand it 
with authority they call ``waiving certain Federal environmental 
laws.'' Let me translate that for you. They want to waive ``all legal 
requirements'' when the Border Patrol is working not just on walls and 
roads, but also tactical infrastructure and technology which applies to 
a much larger swath of Border Patrol activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">They also want to remove the requirement that the American people 
are notified when the waiver authority is used on Federal lands. That 
effectively allows individual Border Patrol agents to decide on the 
spot whether to waive any legal requirements on Federal lands within 
100 miles of the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">Aside from the occasional anecdote, hear-say, and outdated reports, 
there is no evidence that access to Federal lands is a problem. An 
existing Memorandum of Understanding already facilitates the Border 
Patrol and Federal land management agencies to work smoothly together 
on accessing Federal lands, according to past testimony from the Border 
Patrol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">It's not clear to me why, of all the crimes committed in the United 
States, unapproved entry into the country is the only one to merit a 
waiver-fueled police state in the eyes of the Majority. Given the 
Majority's recent letter in defense of the rights of the Bundys, it is 
clear that even repeated domestic terrorism doesn't rise to that level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">The creeping militarization of our border has done little to slow 
border crossings. But it has affected our border communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">I should know. I have border communities in my district. If the 
Chairmen of this Full Committee and Subcommittee had told me they were 
taking a Committee-funded trip to my district and surrounding area, I 
could have shown them the non-border patrol view of border communities. 
They would have found local economies that rely on cross-border 
commerce. They would have seen a desert landscape arbitrarily split by 
a wall, blocking local wildlife from their natural migration patterns, 
and scarring the ecology of the entire region. And they would have 
heard from the people who call this region home about what it means to 
have to surrender their basic rights to the Border Patrol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">Instead, they saw what they wanted to see. Chairman Bishop went so 
far as to tweet to me directly that my ``district has become the 
gateway for cartels to smuggle dangerous drugs into the United States 
and poison American communities.'' That view of our border communities, 
and my district, is based on some very old and very dangerous 
stereotypes and it is just not true. But those are the kinds of views 
motivating this campaign to destroy the quality of life in border 
communities with this wall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">Does the Border Patrol need even more power than the unprecedented

    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Arthur">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I appreciate you</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member McEachin, and members of the 
inviting me here today to discuss these important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to 
experience the natural beauty of our national parks. Recently, 
however, I have had the misfortune of seeing the degradation 
caused by illegal cross-border traffic. Paths worn through 
natural landscapes and abandoned rafts, garbage, and human 
waste were all evidence of illegal entry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">While cross-border traffic has declined in my 25 years in 
the field of immigration, the numbers are still staggering. In 
Fiscal Year 2017, Border Patrol apprehended 303,916 individuals 
along the southwest border. Not all of this traffic consisted 
of aliens coming to the United States for work. Last year, for 
example, Border Patrol seized 9,346 pounds of cocaine, 953 
pounds of heroin, 10,328 pounds of methamphetamines, and 181 
pounds of fentanyl. On my calculations, this is enough fentanyl 
alone to kill 36 million Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">In the last fiscal year, Border Patrol agents apprehended 
8,531 criminal aliens. They also arrested 228 aliens associated 
with MS-13, a gang so organized and dangerous that in 2012 the 
Obama Treasury Department designated them a transnational 
criminal organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">As my written testimony reveals, suspected terrorists are 
also believed to have attempted illegal entry along our 
southern border. Border Patrol agents must confront well-
organized, well-funded, and extremely violent operatives in 
their attempts to secure the southwest border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">Transnational criminal organizations like the Gulf Cartel, 
Los Zetas, and the Sinaloa Cartel, founded by the notorious 
Joaquin ``El Chapo'' Guzman, control territory and smuggling 
routes along the border, and profit from the illegal cross-
border traffic of aliens, drugs, and other contraband. The 
drugs that they deliver flow into every corner of our country, 
ruining lives, destroying families, and undermining our 
communities and our way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">But the consequences are worse for Mexico. In fact, last 
year was that country's most violent on record. Because of 
these groups, corruption there is rampant and civil society 
reels. And as the Mexican Government has targeted these groups, 
the situation has gotten worse because rival cliques war over 
smuggling routes and territory, with innocent civilians caught 
in the crossfire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">But you don't need to believe me about the violent nature 
of these criminals. Last week's Wall Street Journal quoted an 
opponent of the President's wall proposal whose family owns 
land near the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge in Alamo, Texas. She is 
concerned the wall would divide her property, resulting in, 
``drug smugglers attacking farmworkers in hopes of getting the 
code needed to open an access gate.'' She understands the 
danger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">However, our agents have been hamstrung in responding to 
these threats. As you know, Border Patrol must obtain 
permission from Federal land management agencies before its 
agents can maintain roads and install critical infrastructure 
such as surveillance equipment when operating on Federal lands. 
The agency's access to portions of those lands along the 
southwest border has also been limited by land management laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">Given the threat that illegal cross-border traffickers pose 
to our communities and our national security, and the well-
funded and organized nature of the organizations that profit 
from that traffic, this is unacceptable. We all agree that 
protecting the American people must be the first duty of 
government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations">Border Patrol must be able to move freely across Federal 
lands when necessary and have unconstrained access to a 
tactical infrastructure and maintain needed access roads. This 
will not only make our country safer and more secure, it will 
also prevent the environmental degradation caused by such 
traffic and protect the land management employees who work to 
preserve that land.</paragraph>

Immigration at the House Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>

(Internal footnote omitted).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I want to thank you for">Put in layman's terms, pedestrian fencing, roads, lighting, 
sensors, and vehicle barriers each play two different, but 
complementary, roles in border enforcement:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I want to thank you for">First, they serve as a deterrent to attempted entry. For example, 
pedestrian fencing increases the difficulty and cost of such entry, and 
by eliminating easy access across the border, reduces the likelihood of 
attempted entry. Illegal entrants and smugglers follow the same rules 
of incentives and economics that most actors follow, and amend their 
actions accordingly. Similarly, lighting inhibits the ability of those 
caught crossing the border illegally to do so under cover of darkness, 
making it more likely that they will be caught, and less likely that 
they will be enter the United States to, for example, work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I want to thank you for">Second, such infrastructure creates an impediment to illicit 
crossing. Even if an individual attempts illegal entry by going around 
barriers or over fencing, those impediments will slow entry, providing 
Border Patrol more time to deploy agents to the incursion point. In the 
same way, sensors and cameras notify Border Patrol about illegal 
entries, again facilitating timely deployment. This enables CBP to 
direct its limited resources effectively and efficiently to those areas 
where active incursions are occurring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I want to thank you for">And, by any measure, those resources are limited. As of February 
2017, CBP had fewer than 20,000 Border Patrol Agents,\22\ below its 
authorization of 21,000. While this number might seem high, the U.S.-
Mexican border is approximately 1,933 miles long, and the U.S.-Canadian 
border spans some 3,987 miles, not including the Canadian border with 
Alaska.\23\ Tactical infrastructure is therefore critical to the Border 
Patrol's mission.

say in the manner in which Border Patrol executes its mission. As a 
practical matter, however, it gives those departments, which do not 
otherwise have a significant national-security mission, veritable veto

possible. What the 2006 MOU does, however, is to put the

law-enforcement activities are not impeded in any way. Given the 
sophistication and funding of the entities with which it must contend, 
Border Patrol must be able to act swiftly, without restrictions, to 
respond to any criminal or national security threat that it faces. Any 
delay will allow those criminal organizations to exploit critical 
vulnerabilities along the border, a fact that can have significant 
safety implications for the United States, as shown above.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="869" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I want to thank you for">As stated above, facilitating the ability of Border Patrol agents 
to perform their duties is critical not only to preventing the illegal 
entry of aliens into the United States, but also to keeping drugs and 
criminals off of American streets, and to ensuring that individuals who

inhibit, impede, or delay access and movement by the Border Patrol to 
any section of the border the agency deems necessary to carry out its 
duties. Border Patrol must not only be allowed to move freely along the 
border, but it must also have the ability, in a timely manner, to 
construct, install, and relocate the necessary tactical infrastructure 
to respond to cross-border threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="871" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I want to thank you for">It is incumbent upon Congress to assess whether any laws that

criminal groups controlling illicit cross-border traffic, Border Patrol 
must have the ability to react in a timely manner to any incursion. It 
is impossible to know whether a group of individuals crossing the 
border illegally are coming here to work, are carrying drugs, or pose a 
risk to the American people until they are intercepted. Congress must 
ensure that Border Patrol has that ability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="874" speaker="Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, I want to thank you for">At a minimum, Congress should review the 2006 MOU among DHS, DOI,

</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF DAN BELL, PRESIDENT, ZZ CATTLE CORPORATION,</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DAN BELL">The Chair now recognizes Mr. Bell to testify
for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="DAN BELL">                        NOGALES, ARIZONA
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bell">Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member McEachin, and
members of the Committee, good morning. My name is Daniel Bell. 
I am a third-generation rancher from Nogales, Arizona. Our 
family has been ranching on the same piece of country just west 
of the city of Nogales since the late 1930s. The ranch has 
approximately 10 miles of actual border with Mexico, 2 miles of 
bollard fence, a few hundred yards of vehicle barrier, and the 
remaining 8 miles is a four-strand barbed wire fence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bell">In the mid-1990s, illegal border crossers impacting the 
ranch were at an all time high. Groups of 50 or larger were 
being apprehended at any given time. Violence along the border 
was also spiking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bell">In 1998, Border Patrol Agent Alexander Kirpnick was 
murdered by drug smugglers on our ranch. On May 12, 2010, the 
ranch foreman from Mexico, our neighboring ranch in Mexico, was 
murdered and found in a shallow grave. On December 17, 2010, 
Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was murdered on our neighbor's 
ranch directly to the north of us. And on March 27 of 2010, my 
friend, Rob Krentz, was murdered on his ranch in Cochise 
County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bell">With the increase in illegal border crossers came an 
increase in fire frequency on the ranches along the border. 
Failure to extinguish warming fires, fires lit for those in 
distress, and fires lit by smugglers to create diversions were 
common. Year after year, fires started by illegal border 
crossers have cost the U.S. taxpayers millions upon millions of 
dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bell">Much of our time on the ranch is spent fixing fences cut by 
illegal border crossers, dealing with trespass cattle from 
Mexico, and fixing water developments illegal border crossers 
have broken, leaving livestock and wildlife to suffer. Trash 
left behind by illegal border crossers is a huge problem. We 
have literally picked up many tons of discarded duffel bags, 
backpacks, clothing, water bottles, and hauled them off to the 
landfill, only to find them trashed again several months later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bell">The trash left behind can be dangerous to curious livestock 
as well as wildlife. The situation on the ground is not good 
for wildlife, yet the environmental groups will throw out 
concerns for wildlife and endangered species to thwart border 
security. In many cases, the Endangered Species Act is being 
misapplied to species occupying the border region. More often 
than not, they are abundant and healthy throughout their 
extensive range in Mexico and as far south as South America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bell">Along the same lines, the wilderness designations along the 
border have the effect of creating unenforceable corridors and 
pathways into the United States. Vehicle access and the use of 
mechanized and motorized equipment are not permitted. These are 
the areas that tend to be the most heavily used drug 
trafficking routes. Access, infrastructure, and roads are 
drastically needed along the international boundary with 
Mexico. These measures will reduce the footprint of illegal 
border activity and benefit the natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bell">Implementing border projects on federally owned borderland 
is a lengthy process. In 2001, the Border Patrol had a desire 
to build a 4-mile long road along the border on our ranch. 
Actual construction began in 2011. As of today, we can see 
light at the end of the tunnel, nearly 17 years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bell">In recent years, there has been an added emphasis on 
streamlining the process and implementing projects in a timely 
manner on the Coronado National Forest, and they have 
designated a border liaison to assist Border Patrol in planning 
and implementation. The Coronado Forest and the Border Patrol 
are to be commended for the many recent accomplishments along 
the border we see today. I can attest to the effectiveness of 
these measures and how illegal activity has been reduced where 
law enforcement has been given more access to the border. This 
in turn produces the footprint of law enforcement which has a 
positive effect on the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bell">I believe that this is a good model that other Federal 
agencies and state land management agencies need to adopt. Over 
the years, I have witnessed the construction of 2 miles of 
bollard-style fence, 4 miles of road systems along the 
international boundary, the placement of remote video 
surveillance system towers and integrated fixed towers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bell">Also, new border roads have enabled wildland firefighters 
to respond rapidly and get control of fires. Continuing to 
establish better access roads along the international boundary 
with Mexico is vital. Being able to get to the border is 
paramount, if one expects to defend it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bell">There is still work to be done on what is probably some of 
the most challenging terrain encountered along the border. It 
will not be easy, but I have faith we will get it done. I have 
witnessed significant improvements over the past decade and it 
coincided with implementation of the measures that I have 
mentioned here today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Good morning my name is Daniel G. Bell. I am a third-generation 
rancher from Nogales, Arizona and President of the ZZ Cattle 
Corporation. I am a University of Arizona Graduate with a Bachelor of 
Science Degree in Renewable Natural Resources, with emphasis in 
Rangeland Management. Our family has been ranching on the same piece of 
country since the late 1930s. The ranch is located west of the city of 
Nogales, Arizona, along the border with Mexico. The ranch is located 
within the Nogales Station area of responsibility in the Tucson Sector 
of the Border Patrol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Our ranch is nearly 40,000 acres (62.5 sq. mi.) in size and has 
approximately 10 miles of actual border with Mexico. Apart from a 2-
mile stretch of Bollard Fence and a few hundred yards of vehicle 
barrier, the remainder of the international boundary with Mexico is 
comprised of a 4-strand barb wire cattle fence. The ranch consists 
primarily of four Federal grazing permits with the USDA forest service, 
three of which are situated directly on the international boundary with 
Mexico. The ranch also utilizes private land and Arizona State Trust 
Land. The entire ranch is subject to negative impacts revolving around 
illegal border crossers and drug smuggling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bell ">While there have always been impacts regarding illegal border 
crossers and drug smuggling on the ranch, things changed drastically in 
the 1990s! With the implementation of Operation Gatekeeper in 
California and Operation Hold the Line in Texas, illegal border traffic 
was essentially forced into Arizona. The increased illegal border 
traffic forced our border cities and towns to fortify fencing along the 
border, which in turn forced the illegal activity on to the adjacent 
ranch lands. The areas where it was once common to see one or two 
illegal border crossers, exploded into groups ranging in the number of 
50 or more. With that increase, came increases in property damage, 
theft, fire frequency and violence. Our fences were being cut, watering 
facilities were being tampered with and drained, our houses were being 
broken into and valuables were taken. We even had vehicles stolen. On 
one occasion, the wife of one of our employees was forced at knife 
point to prepare meals for a small group. Upon arriving home, our 
employee tracked the illegal border crossers and led authorities to 
their location.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Over the years, violence in the border region had been on the 
increase. Nogales Station agents had been fired upon and in a few 
incidents, agents were wounded by apparent sniper style shootings. In 
1998, Border Patrol Agent Alexander Kirpnick was murdered as he was 
apprehending drug smugglers in one of our grazing pastures. On March 
27, 2010 while checking livestock, watering facilities and fences, my 
friend Rob Krentz was murdered on his ranch in Cochise County. On May 
12, 2010, the ranch foreman from the neighboring ranch in Mexico was 
found murdered and buried in a shallow grave after he had gone missing 
a month earlier. On December 17, 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, 
a member of BORTAC, the elite tactical unit of the Border Patrol, was 
murdered on the neighboring ranch to the north. His team was in the 
area to rid the area of violent rip-off crews that were targeting 
illegal border crossers and drug carriers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bell ">In addition to an increase in violence over the years, fire 
frequency had also increased on the ranches along the border. Failure 
to extinguish warming fires, along with fires lit by illegal border 
crossers in distress, and fires lit by smugglers to create diversions 
were most common. In the mid 2000s, an unoccupied house on the Bear 
Valley portion of our ranch was set ablaze by undocumented aliens when 
they attempted to light the propane powered lights. In 2011, we 
experienced one of the worst fire seasons ever. I believe there were 13 
different fires that year that burned approximately two-thirds of the 
entire ranch. Only one of those fires was considered a naturally caused 
fire, all the others were either diversion fires or distress fires. In 
the years that followed, there have been many more fires started by 
illegal border crossers that have cost the U.S. taxpayers millions upon 
millions of dollars to extinguish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Because the ranch relies on only the grass production from summer 
monsoon rains, we utilize rotational grazing systems that allow for 
different seasons of use and rest. Each grazing permit is divided into 
fenced pastures and the livestock are moved into fresh pastures upon 
reaching a specified utilization level. Under normal circumstances this 
is a substantial undertaking with 4 separate herds and 30 pastures. 
When you ranch on or near the border you can expect that fences will be 
cut by illegal border crossers on a regular basis, causing ranchers to 
constantly inspect fences to ensure cattle remain in the proper 
pasture. Also, when the international boundary with Mexico is a 4-
strand barb wire fence, you can expect to experience problems with 
trespass cattle from Mexico, which also takes considerable time and 
effort to get the cattle back to our Mexican neighbors. The rancher 
bears the cost of the damage at the hands of those engaged in the 
illegal border activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bell ">When you live in and operate a ranch in an arid environment, water 
is an essential piece in the health and welfare of livestock, as well 
as the wildlife that have grown accustomed to the water we provide. 
Most of the water systems located on the ranch are outfitted with water 
faucets to allow anyone to get drink. Unfortunately, illegal border 
crossers have in many instances broken the water developments and 
drained thousands and thousands of gallons of water. Again, the rancher 
bears this cost, as well as, livestock and wildlife dependent on this 
vital resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Several years ago, we participated in a University of Arizona study 
that estimated the additional costs that border ranchers face in the 
wake of illegal immigration. What the study indicated is that for every 
100 pounds of weight that a calf puts on over its life on the ranch, 
there is an additional $15.00 in cost to the rancher. Those are the 
costs that I mentioned above. The average weight of a steer or heifer 
when marketed is 500 lbs which equates to $75.00 per head. If a ranch 
sold 300 head, it would equate to $22,500.00 which is a substantial 
additional cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bell ">In addition to the additional costs, the trash left behind by 
illegal border crossers is a huge problem. We have literally picked up 
many tons of discarded duffle bags, back packs, clothing, water bottles 
and hauled it off to the landfill, only to go to the same spot a few 
months later and clean it up again. In recent years trash has been 
bagged up and hidden in shrubs to conceal the movement of the illegal 
border crossers. The trash left behind is not only unsightly but also 
can be dangerous to livestock and wildlife. Curious animals have been 
known to eat plastic bags containing remnants of food. Cloven hooved 
animals like deer, javelina and cattle have had issues with food 
containers like tuna and sardine cans. The cans get stuck on an 
animal's foot and eventually wear through the bottom of the can, 
causing it to ride up the animal's leg and eventually constrict the leg 
as the animal grows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Where border security measures are lacking, the situation on the 
ground is not a good for wildlife, yet ``radical environmental groups'' 
will throw-out concerns for wildlife and endangered species to thwart 
border security. Much of the area along the border is fringe habitat 
for so-called threatened and endangered species. In many cases, the 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) is being misapplied to species that are 
abundant and healthy throughout their extensive range in Mexico and as 
far as South America. There is a definite double standard when the 
border is used to define a species' limited range in the United States 
to garner protections under ESA, but in the next breath we are told you 
can't have border security because wildlife species do not recognize 
borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Along the same lines wilderness designations and natural areas 
along the border have the effect of creating unenforceable corridors 
and pathways into the United States, where vehicles, as well as 
mechanized and motorized equipment are not permitted. In fact, these 
areas are the most heavily drug trafficked routes on the ranch. We have 
had chance encounters with armed drug smugglers and their human mules 
in the Pajarito Wilderness and a local chapter of the Boy Scouts of 
America will not go backpacking in the area after an encounter they had 
on one of their field days. Wilderness areas that limit access are 
available to Border Patrol Agents on only foot or horseback.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Access and infrastructure in the form of roads is drastically 
needed along the border, otherwise the area of operation remains 
unwieldy. By creating better access along the international boundary, 
the footprint of illegal border activity will be greatly reduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bell ">With better access, infrastructure like barriers, walls and fences 
can be constructed. Better access will also facilitate implementation 
of technology in the form Remote Video Surveillance Systems (RVSS), 
Integrated Fixed Towers (IFTs) and Mobile Surveillance Capable (MSC) 
Vehicles. Agents will be more efficient in securing the border when the 
area they are responsible for patrolling is significantly reduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bell ">The reality of gaining access and constructing infrastructure along 
the border on Federal lands is a lengthy process and it needs to be 
streamlined. In 2001, Border Patrol had a desire to build a 4-mile 
road, referred to by some as the 222-interconnector road, along the 
border on our ranch. Actual construction began in 2011 and as of today 
there is light at the end of the tunnel, nearly 17 years later. In 
recent years there has been added emphasis on streamlining the process 
and implementing projects in a timely manner. For several years now, 
the Coronado National Forest has had a liaison assigned, to assist 
Border Patrol and try to streamline projects on the Forest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bell ">The Nogales Ranger District and the Border Patrol are to be 
commended for many of the recent accomplishments along the border 
today. I can attest to the effectiveness of these measures and how 
illegal traffic has been reduced in areas where law enforcement has 
been given more access to the border. That access reduces the footprint 
of the illegal activity as well as the footprint required for law 
enforcement, which is a positive for the environment. I believe that 
this is a good model that other Federal and state land management 
agencies need to adopt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Until access and infrastructure can be established in rugged and 
remote areas, it is extremely important that we do not lose focus of 
the other important aspects of border security. Air assets like 
helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft, as well as drones, need to be 
available to detect illegal activity. Providing support from above, 
inserting agents, guiding them to intercept points, and providing the 
much-needed situational awareness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Another area of importance, especially in remote areas is the lack 
the necessary communications technology for both law enforcement and 
civilians. This is important as there are citizens out recreating in 
the forest despite the travel caution signage warnings of smuggling and 
illegal immigration in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Of course, the most crucial factor is having boots on the 
ground, in the right place and at the right time to intercept illegal 
activity. In rugged areas Border Patrol must increase horse patrols and 
establish Forward Operating Bases in remote areas which have been 
effectively used in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Funding State and Federal Attorneys' Offices must be adequate to 
assure timely prosecution of border related offenses. As part of that, 
ensuring that there are judicial resources in place to provide 
consequences to offenders is imperative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Border Patrol Ranch Liaison Programs to address concerns and gather 
intelligence. I am fortunate to be a part of the Citizens Advisory 
Boards and the Rancher Liaison Group for the Nogales Border Patrol 
Station. It gives me the opportunity to address security issues in 
areas of our operation and allows Border Patrol the ability to 
communicate with the public and the folks most affected by illegal 
activity. I view these groups as another sort of metric.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Bell ">My focus here today is to highlight what I consider to be useful 
and positive measures to help secure the border and the lands we work 
on. Measurables like creating access and establishing roads along the 
international boundary with Mexico. Being able to get to the border is 
paramount if one expects to defend it. Border Patrol has done an 
excellent job in many areas along the border and in my estimation the 
easier areas have been addressed. What remains on the table is probably 
some of the most challenging terrain encountered along the border, most 
of which has no vehicle access. It will not be easy, but I have faith 
it will get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Over the last decade, I have witnessed the construction of 2 miles 
of a Bollard style fence, focusing attention to the international 
boundary with Mexico. The fence construction improved range condition 
by eliminating the constant flow of illegal border crossers that 
created havoc with trails and left trash throughout the landscape. It 
only took the resource a short time heal and become productive once 
again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Bell ">In establishing 4 miles of road systems along the international 
boundary and simultaneously erecting RVSS Towers and Integrated Fixed 
Towers, the traffic patterns were again changed nearly overnight with 
the flick of switch. We were no longer getting the traffic at the ranch 
headquarters 7 miles from the border. Again, we were witness as the 
range responded and trails healed. We also noticed that there were less 
trespass cattle from Mexico as cuts in the barb wire fence were fewer. 
I even queried friends who lived in the unincorporated community of Rio 
Rico on the northern boundary of the ranch and asked if they were 
experiencing the same reductions in activity, to which the answer was 
yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Bell ">In the areas with better access to the border there is a notable 
reduction in fire frequency and with less incidence of fire spreading 
as the roads have enabled wildland firefighters to respond and get 
control of fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Bell ">As I have stated before. I have witnessed improvement over the past 
few years in certain areas and it has coincided with the implementation 
of the measures that I have mentioned to you here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Bell ">Thank you for your time and allowing me to come before you today!</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="SCOTT NICOL">The Chair now recognizes Mr. Nicol to
testify for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="SCOTT NICOL">           CAMPAIGN, THE SIERRA CLUB, McALLEN, TEXAS
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Nicol">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Nicol">I am the volunteer Co-Chair for the Sierra Club Borderlands 
Team, and I live and teach in McAllen, one of the safest cities 
in the state of Texas. My house is 12 miles north of a section 
of border wall. The actual border is another mile further 
south. The wall south of my home cuts off a World Birding 
Center, established to attract eco-tourism dollars to a 
community in one of the poorest counties in the United States 
from an adjacent U.S. Fish and Wildlife refuge. And like most 
of the rest of the 654 miles of border that already have a wall 
or barrier, it was built without regard for local, state, and 
Federal laws meant to protect the environment and border 
communities like mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Nicol">The authority given to DHS to selectively disregard laws it 
deems inconvenient when it builds walls along either the U.S.-
Mexico or U.S.-Canada border should not be expanded to cover 
all enforcement activities on all Federal lands within 100 
miles of both borders, as has been proposed. The laws that are 
swept aside are not merely red tape, they are critical 
protections that were put in place for a reason, to protect 
people, their communities, and the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Nicol">The levee border wall that stands 12 miles south of my home 
is a prime example. Twenty-seven laws were waived to expedite 
its construction. The pre-existing levee was essentially a pile 
of earth with a gentle slope on either side that terrestrial 
animals could easily surmount. To convert it into a levee 
border wall, the river-facing side was carved away and replaced 
with an 18-foot tall vertical concrete slab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Nicol">Like many of the levee border walls in the Rio Grande 
Valley, this one cuts off a portion of the lower Rio Grande 
Valley National Wildlife Refuge, which was intended to provide 
habitat for endangered ocelots, a small wild cat. A year after 
the levee wall's completion, flooding of the Rio Grande 
inundated farmlands and refuge tracts for 3 to 4 months. Where 
sloping levees had been converted into levee border walls, the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife reported that, ``The floodwall blocked 
almost all egress for terrestrial wildlife species.. . . 
Hundreds of shells of Texas tortoise have been found 
demonstrating the probability of mortality for species which 
could not retreat from rising water levels. The Service fears 
any ocelots or jaguarundi that may have been caught in these 
areas when water began to rise may have been malnourished, 
injured, or perished.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Nicol">Other walls have been built without regard for laws that 
protect people from unnecessary flooding. We have seen 
devastating floods in communities like Nogales and in protected 
natural areas such as Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. When 
walls are built across our rivers, arroyos, and flash flood 
zones, they catch debris, back up water as much as 6 feet deep, 
and cause massive damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Nicol">The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act 
was also waived when barriers were built in the Tohono O'odham 
Nation in southern Arizona. Chairman Ned Norris, Jr. testified 
that during the building of border barriers, ``Fragments of 
human remains were observed in the tire tracks of the heavy 
construction equipment. Barriers of the border road now cross 
the site. Imagine a bulldozer parking in your family graveyard 
turning up bones.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Nicol">The expansion of waivers to cover not only the construction 
of walls along the border but any Border Patrol or Customs and 
Border Protection activity on Federal lands within 100 miles of 
the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada border would add to the 
unnecessary damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Nicol">In 2011, Ron Vitiello, who is currently the Acting Deputy 
Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, testified that, 
``In law enforcement, we operate within the confines of the 
rule of law and regulations. Would our efforts be easier 
without these legal frameworks? Yes, it would. However, we find 
a way to reasonably and sensibly solve problems within the 
parameters of law. Does the Border Patrol face challenges with 
respect to operating around protected lands when they are in 
our enforcement zones? Yes. But, again, we have been able to 
establish practical solutions to allow for mission success.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Nicol">Laws have also been waived for patrol roads along the 
border. In addition to causing environmental harm, carving a 
road through a formerly roadless locale can make that area more 
accessible to drive-throughs by smugglers. This occurred in the 
San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, which stated in its 
2008 annual report that newly installed tactical 
infrastructure, ``Allowed vehicles loaded with marijuana to 
drive into the United States, using the new system of all-
weather roads constructed by DHS. Drive-through drug loads have 
subsequently increased in the San Bernardino Valley.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Nicol">So, the waiving of laws has proved to be environmentally 
destructive, and by short-circuiting the normal deliberative 
process, has allowed for counter-productive activities to be 
undertaken. It has also hurt borderland communities.</paragraph>

  Prepared Statement of Scott Nicol, Sierra Club Borderlands Team Co-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">Chair, McAllen, Texas</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">My name is Scott Nicol. I am the Volunteer Co-Chair for the Sierra 
Club's Borderlands Team and I live and teach in McAllen, one of the 
safest cities in the state of Texas. My house is 12 miles north of a 
section of border wall; the actual border is another mile further

established to attract eco-tourism dollars to a community in one of the

that currently stand, it was built without regard for local, state, and 
Federal laws meant to protect the environment and border communities 
like mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">The authority given to the Department of Homeland Security to 
disregard laws it deems inconvenient when it comes to border walls 
along both the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada border should not be 
expanded to cover all enforcement activities on all Federal lands 
within 100 miles of both borders, as has been proposed. This flies in 
the face of the basic tenet that the United States is a nation of laws, 
and sets a terrible precedent that could be applied to other 
destructive Federal projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">But the biggest problem with waiving laws is not judicial or 
philosophical, it is concrete. The laws that are swept aside are not 
merely red tape. They are critical protections that were put in place 
for a reason--to protect people, their communities, and the environment 
that we depend upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">The levee-border wall that stands 12 miles south of my home is a 
prime example. In 2008, 27 laws were waived to ``expedite'' 
construction, and it was completed in 2009. The pre-existing levee was 
essentially a pile of earth with a gentle slope on either side that 
terrestrial animals could easily surmount. To convert it into a levee-
border wall, the river-facing side was carved away and replaced with an 
18-foot tall vertical concrete slab. It is a barrier that is readily 
climbed by humans, as the ever-replenishing piles of ladders that still 
accumulate beside it attest to, but which animals that don't have wings 
or ladder technology cannot get past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">Like many of the levee-border walls in the Rio Grande Valley, this 
one cuts off a portion of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife 
Refuge, which was intended to provide habitat for endangered ocelots, a 
small wildcat with spots resembling a leopard's. With the Endangered 
Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act waived, the 
wall's impact upon ocelots was detrimental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">A year after the levee-wall's completion, the Rio Grande flooded, 
backing water up to the levees and inundating farmlands and refuge 
tracts for 3 to 4 months. Where sloping levees had been converted to 
levee-border walls, U.S. Fish and Wildlife reported that:</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">\1\ Rationale and Justification for Conservation Measures Rio 
Grande Valley Sector. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Corpus Christi Ecological 
Services Field Office. March 9, 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">The decision to waive laws in order to build border walls has 
caused harm that might otherwise have been avoided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">Walls have been built without regard for laws that protect people 
from unnecessary flooding. We have seen devastating floods in 
communities like Nogales and in protected natural areas such as Organ 
Pipe Cactus National Monument. When walls are built across our rivers, 
arroyos and flash flood zones, they catch debris, back up water as much 
as 6-feet deep, and cause massive damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">In 2008, flooding caused by the border wall in Nogales, Sonora, 
caused millions of dollars of property damage and was responsible for 
two deaths. Following that event many walls were retrofitted with gates 
that were intended to allow water and debris to pass through, but in 
2011 and 2014 those measures failed to stop debris from piling up, 
flood water building up, and sections of border wall being washed away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is, as 
its title implies, intended to prevent the desecration and destruction 
of Native American burials, a goal which one might assume would be 
widely shared. But when waivers were issued for border barrier 
construction through the Tohono O'odham Nation, the Native American 
Protection and Repatriation Act was suspended in the project area. The 
compilation of a list of laws that are to be waived implies a degree of 
forethought, as there is no reason to waive a law that border barriers 
or roads are unlikely to violate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">The waiving of the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act proved prescient. In 2008, Tribal Chairman Ned Norris 
Jr. testified that during the building of border barriers:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">``. . . fragments of human remains were observed in the tire</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Nicol ">tracks of the heavy construction equipment. Barriers and the</paragraph>

and Foreign Operations of the Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform and the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public 
Lands of the Committee on Natural Resources. April 15, 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Subcommittee on Fish, Wildlife and Oceans. April 28, 2008.">Since Acting Deputy Commissioner Vitiello made this statement, in a 
congressional committee hearing discussing a proposal to waive laws on 
Federal lands very similar to the one being made today, Border Patrol 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
apprehensions have decreased, and seizures of marijuana have plummeted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Subcommittee on Fish, Wildlife and Oceans. April 28, 2008.">It has been alleged that the need to comply with Federal laws when 
new patrol roads are established or existing roads are repaired through 
protected Federal lands undermines Border Patrol interdiction efforts. 
But in addition to the environmental harm that cutting a road through a 
refuge or wilderness area can inflict, carving a road through a 
formerly roadless area can make an area that was previously impassable 
to smugglers easily accessible. This occurred in the San Bernardino 
National Wildlife Refuge, where 10 miles of barrier and patrol roads 
were built following the issuance of a waiver. Located in Arizona's 
southeastern corner, where the terrain is heavily eroded, with deep 
fissures that make much of the area impassable to vehicles. 
Nonetheless, in 2008 Customs and Border Protection proposed the 
erection of barriers and construction of a graded patrol road through 
the area. In response a local stakeholder who had been working with the 
Malpai Borderlands Group (an association of ranchers who work together 
to restore and maintain natural processes while encouraging ranching 
and other traditional livelihoods) warned:</paragraph>

inflicted tremendous damage that otherwise might have been avoided. 
With the Antiquities Act waived, a known archaeological site which 
refuge managers had asked workers to avoid harming, was destroyed to 
create an equipment staging area. Two bodies of water that are home to 
fish listed under the Endangered Species Act were partially filled with 
loose dirt in an effort to create a roadbed. A bulldozer sank and got 
stuck in the resulting saturated muck in one of the ponds. As 
predicted, soon after the barriers and patrol road were constructed 
through the previously impassable terrain, refuge staff reported that 
the new ``tactical infrastructure'' facilitated, rather than deterred, 
illicit cross-border traffic. The San Bernardino National Wildlife

destructive, by short-circuiting the normal deliberative process, it 
has allowed for counter-productive activities to be undertaken. It has 
also hurt borderlands communities. With the waiving of protections like

flooded and borderlands residents are left with the aftermath.

    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF BRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="BRANDON JUDD">The Chair now recognizes Mr. Judd to testify
for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="BRANDON JUDD">                    COUNCIL, TUCSON, ARIZONA
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Judd">Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member McEachin, and
distinguished members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Judd">The myriad of laws, regulations, and bureaucratic policies 
related to federally managed and protected lands prevent Border 
Patrol agents in the field from fully doing their job on a 
daily basis. Ultimately, these laws undermine our ability to 
effectively and efficiently secure our borders, and put the 
lives of our agents and the public at greater risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Judd">The vast majority of apprehensions made by the Border 
Patrol occur on the southern border with Mexico. Along this 
very same border, roughly 40 percent of the land that makes up 
our 2,000-mile long border is designated by the Federal 
Government as some type of Federal land. This is land that is 
managed, controlled, or protected by multiple agencies spread 
across two separate cabinet-level departments, not including 
the department responsible for border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Judd">Simply looking at a map of border areas in California, 
Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, one will see a landscape 
blanketed by Federal lands that include national conservation 
areas, forests, monuments, parks, recreation areas, scenic 
areas, and wildlife refuges. The restrictions that agents face 
on these lands on a daily basis are due to a laundry list of 
some three dozen laws that date back over a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Judd">Even with the significant impediments to our work stemming 
from these legal requirements and regulations, morale among 
rank and file Border Patrol agents is surging, thanks to the 
support and backing we have received from the Trump 
administration encouraging agents to go out and do the job we 
were hired to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Judd">In fact, from his very first week in office, President 
Trump has demonstrated his unwavering commitment to finally 
securing our land borders. On January 25 of last year, 
President Trump signed Executive Order 13767 to improve border 
security and immigration enforcement. Most relevant for the 
Subcommittee is Section 12 of the order, which directs the 
Secretaries of Homeland Security, Interior, and Agriculture, to 
take all appropriate action to ensure that the men and women of 
the Border Patrol have access to all Federal lands in order to 
secure our land borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Judd">This important executive action is a crucial step to solve 
a problem that has long plagued the Border Patrol and our 
ability to do our job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Judd">As Chairman Westerman and Bishop recently saw firsthand, 
the challenges created by these legal requirements, rules, and 
policies are very real for those patrolling our borders. For 
example, in the Coronado National Forest within the Tucson 
Sector of Arizona, our inability to build proper access roads 
along and near the line, including secondary roads, diminishes 
agent mobility while patrolling, and ultimately prevents agents 
from being as effective as they could otherwise be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Judd">Because there is no actual east-west border road beyond the 
fence, which only stretches a short distance into the forest, 
the United States, in essence, has ceded approximately a 
quarter mile of U.S. territory to criminal enterprise, 
including drug and human traffickers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Judd">While my primary concern is overall border security, 
including the safety of agents and the public, I would like to 
highlight for the Subcommittee how unintended consequences 
stemming from environmental laws meant to protect our natural 
resources can have the opposite effect and actually harm the 
environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Judd">For example, in one of my personal experiences in the mid-
2000s, in the Naco area of operations within the Tucson Sector, 
the Border Patrol built a continuous fence that was constructed 
right up to the San Pedro River within the San Pedro National 
Conservation Area. While we were able to continue with the 
construction of the fence to the west of this sensitive 
riparian area, due to legal restrictions, we had to wait to 
complete construction within the conservation area until we had 
the required permitting and the environmental impact studies 
were complete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Judd">During this long waiting period, the massive hole left in 
our fencing allowed criminal enterprises to drive their 
vehicles up to the riparian area with absolutely no regard for 
this environmentally sensitive area. While we now have some 
barriers in place that make it a little more difficult for 
criminal enterprises to spoil this riparian area, due to the 
difficulty of the laws, the barriers are a far cry from what is 
needed and are easily defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Judd">Finally, I would like to close by urging Congress to 
consider and pass legislation that would solve these very real 
problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Judd">Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the Subcommittee, 
Chairman Bishop, and Congressman Johnson, for your work in 
crafting reform language that has been included in H.R. 4760, 
Securing America's Future Act. This Committee's contribution to 
the broader border security reform is crucial to ensure that 
agents have the ability to properly patrol Federal lands and 
prevent all unlawful entries into the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Judd">Additionally, the Committee may want to consider an 
amendment to ensure that Border Patrol efforts to close off 
tunnels used by drug and human smugglers are not delayed or 
blocked by existing laws. Regardless of this amendment, by 
waiving the relevant environmental laws and thus eliminating 
the restrictions imposed on Border Patrol, the Committee's 
legislation will finally take the handcuffs off the agents and 
allow us to simply do our jobs.</paragraph>

    <Statement>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Judd follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Judd ">I want to thank the Subcommittee, and I look forward to 
answering any and all of your questions.
 Prepared Statement of Brandon Judd, on behalf of the National Border</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Patrol Council, Tucson, Arizona</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member McEachin, and distinguished 
members of the Subcommittee, I would like to thank you for inviting me 
to testify before you today in order to communicate the significant 
challenges that our Nation's Border Patrol Agents are facing, 
specifically when patrolling on Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Judd ">My name is Brandon Judd and I currently serve as the President of 
the National Border Patrol Council, where I represent approximately 
16,000 Border Patrol field agents and support staff. I have 20 years of 
experience as a Border Patrol Agent and a thorough understanding of the 
policies affecting border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Judd ">While this is my first time testifying before this Subcommittee, I 
know that both the Subcommittee and Full Committee have been working 
for years to address the issues before us today and I am grateful for 
your continued oversight and steadfast dedication to solving these 
problems. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to describe the 
current state of the border and how the myriad of laws, regulations and 
bureaucratic policies related to federally managed and protected lands 
prevent Border Patrol Agents in the field from fully doing their job on 
a daily basis. Ultimately, these laws undermine our ability to 
effectively and efficiently secure our borders and put the lives of our 
agents and the public at greater risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Judd ">As the Subcommittee is undoubtedly aware, the vast majority of 
apprehensions made by the Border Patrol occur on our southern land 
border with Mexico. Even though we saw apprehension numbers drop to 
historic lows soon after President Trump took office, the Border Patrol 
still made over 310,000 total apprehensions across the country during 
Fiscal Year 2017. Of those 310,000 apprehensions, nearly 304,000 or 
roughly 98 percent, occurred along the southwest border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Along this very same border, roughly 40 percent of the land that 
makes up our 2,000 mile-long border is designated by the Federal 
Government as some type of Federal land, according to a Government 
Accountability Office analysis. This is land that is managed, 
controlled or protected by multiple agencies, spread across two 
separate cabinet-level departments, not including the Department 
responsible for border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Simply looking at a map of border areas in California, Arizona, New 
Mexico and Texas, one will see a landscape blanketed by Federal lands 
that include National Conservation Areas, Forests, Monuments, Parks, 
Recreation Areas, Scenic Areas, and Wildlife Refuges. The restrictions 
that agents face on these lands on a daily basis are due to a laundry 
list of some three dozen laws that date back over a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Even with the significant impediments to our work stemming from 
these legal requirements and regulations, morale among rank-and-file 
Border Patrol Agents is surging thanks to the support and backing we've 
received from the Trump administration encouraging agents to go out and 
do the job we were hired to do. In fact, from his very first week in 
office, President Trump has demonstrated his unwavering commitment to 
finally securing our land borders. On January 25 of last year, 
President Trump signed Executive Order 13767 to improve border security 
and immigration enforcement. Most relevant for the Subcommittee is 
Section 12 of the Order which directs the Secretaries of Homeland 
Security, the Interior and Agriculture to ``take all appropriate 
action'' to ensure that the men and women of the Border Patrol have 
access to all Federal lands in order to secure our land borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Judd ">This important executive action is a crucial step to solve a 
problem that has long plagued the Border Patrol and our ability to do 
our job. Even former President Obama's Homeland Security Secretary 
Janet Napolitano acknowledged the significance of the problem when she 
wrote in a 2009 letter that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Judd ">``While the USBP recognizes the importance and value of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Judd ">wilderness area designations, they can have a significant</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Judd ">impact on USBP operations in border regions. This includes that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Judd ">these types of restrictions can impact the efficacy of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Judd ">operations and be a hindrance to the maintenance of officer</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Judd ">safety. The USBP, in accordance with [a] 2006 MOU [with DOI and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Judd ">USDA] makes every reasonable effort to use the least impacting</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Judd ">means of transportation within wilderness; however along the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Judd ">southwest border it can be detrimental to the most effective</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Judd ">accomplishment of the missions. For example, it may be</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Judd ">inadvisable for officer safety to wait for the arrival of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Judd ">horses for pursuit purposes, or to attempt to apprehend</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Judd ">smuggling vehicles within wilderness with a less capable form</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Judd ">of transportation.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Judd ">While the ``detrimental'' impact to the border security mission is 
certainly concerning when reading former Secretary Napolitano's letter, 
what I'd like the Subcommittee to focus on for a moment are the real-
life implications for agent safety--something that should be of 
paramount concern to everyone. To ever suggest that an agent--who is 
likely working alone, probably on terrain making he or she vulnerable 
to attack, and almost certainly in a remote location--should wait for 
the arrival of agents mounted on horses in order to safely make an 
apprehension of an illegal entrant is completely and utterly absurd. I 
hope that the Subcommittee would never tolerate policies of this nature 
and allow senior agency bureaucrats in Washington to prioritize 
possible impacts on the environment over the safety of the men and 
women of the Border Patrol. This is of particular concern at a time 
when we've seen a dramatic increase in assaults on agents. Just last 
year, assaults on Agents were up by 76 percent and totaled 774 for 
2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Judd ">With the threats facing agents at an all-time high due to drug 
cartels, violent criminal aliens and ever-growing personnel shortages, 
the last thing agents need to contend with are the added burdens 
created by environmental laws, regulations and memos drafted by 
supervisors and managers sitting behind desks. As Chairmen Westerman 
and Bishop recently saw firsthand, the challenges created by these 
legal requirements, rules and policies are very real for those 
patrolling our borders. For example, in the Coronado National Forest 
within the Tucson Sector of Arizona, our inability to build proper 
access roads along and near the line, including secondary roads, 
diminishes agent mobility while patrolling and ultimately prevents 
agents from being as effective as they could otherwise be. Because 
there is no actual east-west border road beyond the fence, which only 
stretches a short distance into the Forest, the United States in 
essence has ceded approximately a quarter-mile of U.S. territory to 
criminal enterprise, including drug and human traffickers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Judd ">While my primary concern is overall border security including the 
safety of agents and the public, I'd like to highlight for the 
Subcommittee how unintended consequences stemming from environmental 
laws meant to protect our natural resources can have the opposite 
effect and actually harm the environment. For example, in one of my 
personal experiences in the mid-2000s in the Naco Area of Operations 
within the Tucson Sector, the Border Patrol built a continuous fence 
that was constructed right up to the San Pedro River within the San 
Pedro National Conservation Area. This conservation area runs north 
from the border and is made up of approximately 57,000 acres of public 
land, managed by the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. 
While we were able to continue with the construction of the fence to 
the west of this sensitive riparian area, due to legal restrictions, we 
had to wait to complete construction within the conservation area until 
we had the required permitting and the environmental impact studies 
were complete. During this long waiting period, the massive hole left 
in our fencing allowed criminal enterprises to drive their vehicles up 
the riparian area along and near the riverbed, with absolutely no 
regard for this environmentally sensitive area. While we now have some 
barriers in place that make it a little more difficult for criminal 
enterprises to spoil this riparian area, due to the difficulty of the 
laws the barriers are a far cry from what's needed and are easily 
defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Tactical infrastructure and barriers, such as the fencing in Naco, 
are crucial to preventing illegal entries and securing our border. 
While there has been no shortage of debate and controversy over the 
proposed border wall, in my opinion serving in the Border Patrol for 
the past 20 years, including in the busiest sector in the history of 
the Border Patrol, a wall, in strategic locations is pivotal to 
securing our border. Without physical barriers, such as a wall, we're 
far less able to dictate and direct where illegal entries are made, 
making us less effective and inefficient. A wall in strategic locations 
will ultimately lead to far greater effectiveness and allow us to 
direct our very limited manpower resources to areas without barriers 
and where illegal crossings are more likely to take place. If, in the 
coming months and years, new plans and efforts to build physical 
barriers are blocked, delayed or otherwise stopped because of these 
environmental laws, then the safety and security of our agents and 
citizens will suffer greatly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Finally, I'd like to close by urging Congress to consider and pass 
legislation that would solve these very real problems. Mr. Chairman, I 
would like to commend this Subcommittee, Chairman Bishop and 
Congressman Johnson for your work in crafting reform language that has 
been included in H.R. 4760, Securing America's Future Act, sponsored by 
Chairmen Goodlatte, McCaul, and Labrador, as well as Chairwoman 
McSally. This Committee's contribution to the broader border security 
reform effort is crucial to ensure that agents have the ability to 
properly patrol Federal lands and prevent all unlawful entries into the 
United States. While this legislation is still pending before the 
House, I'd like to suggest that the Committee consider amending Section 
1118 to ensure that the Border Patrol can conduct proper maintenance of 
physical barriers, tactical infrastructure and technology on Federal 
lands. Additionally, the Committee may want to consider an amendment to 
ensure that Border Patrol efforts to close off tunnels used by drug and 
human smugglers are not delayed or blocked by existing laws. Regardless 
of these two suggestions, by waiving the relevant environmental laws 
and thus eliminating the restrictions imposed on the Border Patrol, the 
Committee's legislation will finally take the handcuffs off of agents, 
and allow us to simply do our jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Judd ">I want to thank the Subcommittee for your time this morning and I 
look forward to answering any questions that you may have.</paragraph>

 Questions Submitted for the Record by Rep. Grijalva to Brandon Judd,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Judd ">President, National Border Patrol Council</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Please answer the following questions regarding the 2014 incident 
you described in which Border Patrol could not fill a cross-border 
tunnel near the San Diego area due to the presence of a bird's nest:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Question 1. What was the specific location of the opening of the 
tunnel? Was the opening located on Federal lands?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Answer. Prior to the hearing, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
management sent one of my consultants an e-mail regarding tunnel 
remediation delays stemming from environmental laws. Below are the 
relevant portions of the e-mail with the example. The agency is the 
entity that provided me with this information and thus allowed me to 
use the information if relevant questions were asked at the hearing. 
The information provided by CBP does not give the specific location in 
San Diego of the opening of the tunnel nor if it was on Federal lands. 
I have no additional information regarding the 2014 incident described 
by CBP management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you 
ask the agency for additional information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Email from CBP management (bold added for emphasis):</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Judd ">``All tunnel remediations have to go through the NEPA process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Last, in order to better assist the Ranking Member and the 
Committee in its oversight, I wanted to let the Committee know that 
based on additional information provided by CBP, 194 illicit cross-
border tunnels have been discovered nationally since Fiscal Year 2000. 
Based on the CBP data, four cross-border tunnels were discovered during 
Fiscal Year 2014 in the San Diego Sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Question 2. What species of bird occupied the nest near the tunnel 
opening? How close was the nest to the tunnel opening?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no 
additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP 
management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the 
agency for additional information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Question 3. Which Federal agency directed Border Patrol to postpone 
filling the tunnel until the bird's eggs had hatched? Under what 
authority or environmental law was this directive given?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no 
additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP 
management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the 
agency for additional information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Question 4. How long did the tunnel remain unfilled since being 
discovered? How much of this time was due solely to the presence of the 
bird's nest?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no 
additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP 
management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the 
agency for additional information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Question 5. Was an environmental impact statement required to fill 
the tunnel? Has Border Patrol established a categorical exclusion under 
NEPA for filling cross borders tunnels? If not, why not?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no 
additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP 
management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the 
agency for additional information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Question 6. Has the tunnel since been filled? If not, why not? Is 
the portion of the tunnel on the Mexico side of the border filled?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question Number 1. I have no 
additional information regarding the 2014 incident described by CBP 
management beyond what was in the e-mail and recommend that you ask the 
agency for additional information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Other questions for Mr. Judd:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Question 7. What was NBPC's involvement in Mark Morgan's dismissal?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Answer. The first time I was made aware that former Chief Mark 
Morgan was being dismissed was on the morning of January 26, 2017 when 
CBP Acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan called me and informed me he 
made the decision to remove Chief Mark Morgan from his position as the 
Chief of the Border Patrol. There were several NBPC officers with me 
when Acting Commissioner McAleenan called me. The call was professional 
and appropriate. Acting Commissioner McAleenan knew I would get 
numerous questions from the media and he asked that, ``I do not dance 
on his grave.'' I am not aware that I or NBPC played a role in Chief 
Morgan's dismissal and I certainly never asked Acting Commissioner 
McAleenan to remove Morgan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Furthermore, I am not aware of any statute, regulation or policy 
that would have given me, as a GS-12 Border Patrol Agent and President 
of the NBPC, or the NBPC itself, the authority to determine the 
employment status of any CBP employee, including the Chief of the 
Border Patrol. As per the call referenced above with Acting 
Commissioner McAleenan, he made it very clear that the decision to 
remove Chief Morgan was his and his alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Judd ">At the time he was appointed to be the Chief, Chief Morgan was a 
retired Federal employee and was hired to the Chief's post as a rehired 
annuitant and therefore did not have the protections of a career 
employee. Acting Commissioner McAleenan was free to dismiss him without 
the customary formalities because he was not a career employee but 
rather was a rehired annuitant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Judd ">What is true and is well known is that I, acting on behalf of the 
bargaining unit as the President of the NBPC, believed there was a 
culture problem in the Border Patrol and continue to hold this belief 
to this day. When Chief Morgan was selected, I was informed that he was 
selected to bring about a much needed culture change. I was publicly 
supportive of his selection but quickly became disenchanted due to the 
fact that he surrounded himself with the same management officials who 
were the cause of the culture problems. During his short tenure the 
culture did change but changed for the worse, as those same people who 
were in part responsible for the agency's long-standing culture 
problems were emboldened when Chief Morgan failed to make needed 
changes. Sadly under his watch there was less accountability in the 
agency and that lack of accountability continues to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Question 8. Has NBPC ever condemned the use of excessive force?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Answer. Yes. The NBPC does not and will not condone ``excessive 
force.'' Excessive force is against the law and I personally do not 
know any Border Patrol Agent who believes it is acceptable for law 
enforcement officers/agents to break the law. The NBPC does believe in 
due process for all persons including those accused of crossing the 
border illegally, as outlined in law, and that also includes any law 
enforcement officer/agent accused of excessive force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Question 9. The FBI has not found any evidence to suggest that the 
death of Border Patrol agent Rogelio Martinez was caused by an attack. 
What evidence does NBPC use when continuing to characterize this 
incident as a ``heinous attack?''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Answer. On Monday, November 20, 2017, El Paso Sector Assistant 
Chief Patrol Agent Richard C. Whitman sent an e-mail to one of my 
former Local Presidents in which he describes the death of BPA Rogelio 
Martinez as a ``heinous attack.'' When speaking with the media since 
the incident, I have been using the verbiage given to NBPC by 
management officials in the Border Patrol. The following is the text of 
the e-mail in its entirety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Judd ">``I'm sure you are aware of the LOD death of the BBT agent and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Judd ">his partner that is in serious condition. While FBI has the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Judd ">lead, HQ/OBP has directed EPT to throw as much personnel and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Judd ">resources as possible to assist in locking down that area to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Judd ">locate the perpetrators of this heinous attack [emphasis</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Judd ">added]. Obviously, this will cause an additional strain on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Judd ">EPT's already thinly spread staffing. The details on what this</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Judd ">might look like are still being put together. To this end, I</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Judd ">was wondering if the Agency were to grant a blanket extension</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Judd ">on grievances, replies, etc., would you support a moratorium on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Judd ">official time?''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Furthermore, the morning following Agent Martinez' death a 
Supervisory Border Patrol Agent from the El Paso Sector sent the 
following text message to several individuals. Please forgive any 
punctuation or grammar mistakes, I am quoting the text message 
verbatim:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Judd ">``2 agents got assaulted in Van Horn last night and got</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Judd ">airlifted to UMC. There was a sensor activation and 1 agent</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Judd ">responded went back to his vehicle to call out that the sensor</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Judd ">was good. Not sure what happened after that but I'm hearing he</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Judd ">got jumped by 6 mules and had his face basically smashed in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Judd ">2nd agent arrived to help out with trail without knowing 1st</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Judd ">agent had been assaulted and he also got jumped. Word is 1st</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Judd ">agent passed away and 2nd agent is in critical but stable</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Judd ">condition. They r back tracking the group south of van horn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Judd ">Everyone's been activated. We sent 3 guys to assist''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Judd ">As you can clearly see, it was Border Patrol management that 
characterized the death of Rogelio Martinez as an attack. NBPC had no 
reason to believe the information by the agency itself was incorrect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Judd ">                                 ______
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Westerman">I say thank you to all of the witnesses for
your testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Westerman">I would like to remind the members of the Committee that 
Committee Rule 3(d) imposes a 5-minute limit on questions. I 
will now recognize Members for any questions they may wish to 
ask the witnesses. I will recognize myself to start with for 5 
minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Westerman">I also remind the witnesses that we are going to keep this 
to 5 minutes per person. We have votes coming up here shortly, 
so if we cut you off, it is because we have a lot of questions 
we want to ask.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Westerman">My first question is for the whole panel. There is a 
graphic up here, the one on the top left shows a lot of ad hoc 
roads along the border. You see examples of the trash that we 
talked about in some of these areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Westerman">[Slide.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Westerman">In March of 2010, then-Secretary Salazar, while on a border 
visit with Ranking Member Grijalva, stated that, and I quote, 
``Deterring unlawful activity along the border is the best 
option for preventing damage to cultural and natural resources 
and minimizing risks to visitors and employees.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The Fish and Wildlife Service found almost 8,000 miles of 
ad hoc roads used by cross-border violators in the Cabeza 
Prieta National Wildlife Refuge. Millions of pounds of trash 
and waste are collected from layup areas. Wildland fires are 
also often ignited by border violators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    I want to ask each of you a simple yes or no question. Do 
you agree with Secretary Salazar's statement that deterring 
unlawful activity along the border best protects our natural 
resources?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Bell"> Chairman Westerman, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> Mr. Nicol, yes or no?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> It is more complicated than that, unfortunately.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> Mr. Judd?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Judd"> I do agree, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> OK. Mr. Bell, as a third-generation rancher
along the southern border, you have experienced firsthand the 
impact illegal activity can have on Federal lands. Can you 
briefly describe for us how Border Patrol's increased presence 
and infrastructure has improved the health of your grazing 
land?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Bell"> We have a permit that we graze cattle on called
the Mariposa, and when we started grazing there, there was so 
much illegal activity and trash and trails and trespass from 
Mexican cattle, we were unable to actually go in there because 
utilization levels of the grass were already hit. Once Border 
Patrol established a presence on the border, put in a portion 
of the bollard-style fence, we were able to start using that 
the next season. It healed that quickly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> OK. Mr. Judd, a 2006 Memorandum of
Understanding between the Department of the Interior, 
Agriculture, and Homeland Security attempted to provide 
guidance and increase coordination between Customs and Border 
Protection and Federal land managers to balance border security 
and environmental issues. In what ways is this MOU insufficient 
for Border Patrol agents' needs?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Judd"> It is the large bureaucracy that the government
currently has. When we have to go and discuss issues with so 
many different agencies to try to make something happen, we see 
what happened in the San Pedro riparian area. We weren't able 
to build the barriers that were necessary, which allowed the 
human and narcotics smugglers to ruin that area for a time 
until it was able to heal, which took several years. But to 
even put Normandy-style barriers in that area took about 2 
years, just to be able to do that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> And, Mr. Arthur, based on your experience
drafting some of the most significant border security laws 
since September 11, 2001, what would you change in the 2006 MOU 
to ensure that Border Patrol can accomplish its mission on 
Federal lands?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> I would actually refer to the way that the MOU
operates. Right now, it puts environmental agencies in charge 
of border security. Law enforcement should be the entity that 
actually controls the process rather than the other way around.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> OK. Mr. Judd, as mentioned in my opening
statement, during my visit to the southern border, we heard 
from Border Patrol about tunnels being used for drug smuggling, 
and you referenced that as well. Can you briefly explain the 
statutory and regulatory obstacles that agents face when trying 
to remediate one of these cartel tunnels?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Just to remediate a tunnel, we have to follow the
NEPA laws. And in 2014, in San Diego, we had a tunnel that we 
were not able to remediate because a bird had nested in that 
area and we had to wait until the eggs hatched before we could 
remediate that tunnel. The problem with that was that we had to 
allocate resources to guard that tunnel, which then left other 
areas on the border unsecured, which allowed the cartels to 
exploit that area. We have to be able to remediate these 
tunnels immediately.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Westerman">OK. And I am going to stick to my rule, not
going past 5 minutes, or the Committee Rule. So, I won't ask a 
question where you only have a few seconds to answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    With that, I will recognize the Ranking Minority Member of 
the Subcommittee, Mr. McEachin, for questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McEachin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. McEachin">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. McEachin">    Mr. Arthur, is your Center for Immigration Studies the same 
one that was founded by John Tanton?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> It was not founded by John Tanton.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McEachin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. McEachin"> Was it founded in 1985?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> It was founded in 1985. I only began working--
--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McEachin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. McEachin">Thank you. That answers my question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. McEachin">    Mr. Nicol, there has been some suggestion by some of the 
witnesses here that the Border Patrol has been handcuffed. And 
I assume by being handcuffed, we are talking about handcuffed 
by environmental and public policy safety laws. What rights and 
protections do these so-called handcuffs help to keep in place?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> I think it is important to see the interaction
between the Border Patrol and land management agencies as a net 
positive. You have two different agencies that are responsible 
for work in a given area, they should be working together to 
minimize the kind of harm that could be done. Giving one an 
upper hand over the other is not helpful in any way.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McEachin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. McEachin"> All right, sir. The Chairman asked a yes or
no question concerning a quotation from a few years back. You 
gave the answer, it is more complicated than that. Do you care 
to elaborate on your answer at this point?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Nicol">Certainly. Trash can be remediated fairly
easily, it can be picked up. Trails that somebody leaves 
walking across the border can heal themselves relatively 
quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Nicol">    If the laws are waived to build border walls, those walls 
cause significantly more damage, they tend to dam water, they 
cause flooding, the roads that have been carved through are far 
worse than trails. So, yes, it is good to limit the amount of 
trash that is left behind. But if the measures that are used to 
do that are more destructive than the trash itself, then that 
is a bigger problem.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McEachin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. McEachin">Thank you. It also has been suggested that
public land management agencies like the Department of the 
Interior and the USDA are to blame for delays in Border 
Patrol's border security efforts. However, it is my 
understanding that these public land agencies hold an MOU with 
the Department of Homeland Security that helps to ensure 
cooperative management of border security on public lands. In 
fact, both Customs and Border Protection and the Department of 
the Interior have submitted testimony to this Subcommittee 
before saying that the MOU is working well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. McEachin">    To your knowledge, is this MOU working as it was intended?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Nicol">I think generally it is. I think that there are
going to be issues in which one agency or the other, I think 
this goes on both sides, feel that things did not go as quickly 
as they would like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Nicol">    I think one thing that might slow things down is the lack 
of biologists within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife. They have had 
a decreasing workforce, so possibly hiring some more biologists 
would help things like that to speed up. But I think overall it 
has been a positive.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McEachin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. McEachin"> That is probably a nice segue into my final
question to you. How do you think the severe funding cuts 
proposed for the Department of the Interior and the USDA in the 
President's Fiscal Year 2019 budget will affect their ability 
to make land management decisions along the border?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> It will have a tremendous impact. These land
management agencies also have their own law enforcement 
officers. If they don't have the funds to hire those officers 
or retain those officers, if they don't have people on the 
ground in these places, they are less able to do their jobs and 
they are also less able to work with Border Patrol.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McEachin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. McEachin">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. McEachin">    Mr. Chairman, while that concludes my questions, I would 
ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the evidence 
that led the Southern Poverty Law Center to declare the Center 
for Immigration Studies a hate group.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Without objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    The Chair will now recognize the Vice Chair of the 
Committee, Mr. Johnson from Louisiana, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Mr. Judd, I had a couple of questions for you. I want to 
thank you for your service first, and just kind of highlight 
some of the things you have said here today and what you have 
presented. On page 2 of your submitted testimony, you focus on 
the real life implications for agency safety, and you talked 
about that this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Specifically, something that really drew my attention from 
page 2 of your written testimony, you say, ``This is a 
particular concern at a time when we have seen a dramatic 
increase in assaults on agents. And just last year, assaults on 
agents were up 76 percent. They totaled 774 for 2017.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Johnson">It is a dangerous job, and I think the American people 
recognize that or are beginning to appreciate it more. And we 
need to do all we can, that is our commitment, to assist you 
all and protect those who protect us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Since my time is limited, I am not going to repeat 
everything you stated in those comments, but I do want to 
associate myself with that because I think your comments well 
articulate the importance of the topic that we are discussing 
today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Johnson">But here is my question. In your testimony, you also raise 
the point of how unintended consequences of environmental laws, 
which are meant to protect our national resources, are actually 
harming the very areas they are supposed to protect. I am 
curious, in your personal experience that you related in your 
testimony, specifically with regard to the Naco area of 
operations, this is where the Border Patrol was required to 
leave the conservation area alone until it received the 
necessary permits and completed the environmental impact 
studies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    You mention that you had a long waiting period in that 
interim time, but you didn't say exactly how long. I know you 
probably cannot give a detailed number of days, but 
approximately how long was that waiting period? Are we talking 
weeks, months, a year? How long was it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Judd"> To the best of my recollection, it was
approximately 2 years.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Johnson"> So, for nearly 2 years, for that amount of
time, there was a massive hole that allowed criminal 
enterprises to drive their vehicles along areas that were 
intended to be nationally protected areas. Is that right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Yes. I personally chased several of these
vehicles that crossed the border in that area.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Johnson">I think the importance of this hearing today
is that I don't think the American people are aware of how 
nonsensical these things are and that it is jeopardizing our 
public safety. I am so grateful you brought it. It is very 
frustrating to all of us, and it must be very frustrating to 
the agents on the ground. I can just imagine what they must be 
saying about Congress and those who are making these laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    Does it affect morale in that way? I know you said morale 
is trending upward, thankfully, because of the Administration's 
appreciation and the increasing awareness of all this. But that 
has to be a problem on the ground, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Judd"> I believe that all individuals want to feel like
they are productive. I remember the best job that I ever had 
was when I worked construction when I was a college student. I 
was able to leave the construction site, look back and see what 
I accomplished. Border Patrol agents want to feel exactly the 
same way. They want to feel like they are in fact securing the 
border.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Johnson">I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    I had one question for Mr. Nicol with regard to testimony 
you just gave. I think I heard you say that the trash that is 
left behind can be picked up, collected easily. Am I 
characterizing your response?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> A lot more easily than remediating problems that
are caused by border walls and patrol roads, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Johnson"> The reason that piqued my interest is that we
know that Border Patrol estimates that every CBV leaves 
approximately 8.5 pounds of garbage behind, each individual. 
So, if you do the math, based on the Border Patrol's 
conservative estimate of 1.3 million known CBVs, that means 
illegal immigrants and smugglers left approximately 11,050,000 
pounds of trash over a 3-year period. Are you suggesting today 
that that is an easy thing to control and pick up?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> Again, the amount of harm that that does to an
environment, it is significant, but it is far less than the 
amount of harm done by border walls or by roads that are cut 
through roadless areas.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Johnson"> But just so we are clear. Are you saying that
11 million pounds of trash is an easy thing to contain and 
control? Because I thought that is what you said a few minutes 
ago.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> It is matter of which one is greater, which does
the greater harm.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Johnson"> OK. I will yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member for 5 minutes, 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Chairman,
the Committee staff, Mr. McEachin's Subcommittee staff, 
searched long and hard for an example which was in Mr. Judd's 
testimony of a tunnel that was never closed or never mitigated 
because of environmental regulations or laws. The example that 
he just gave about San Diego, I would request, Mr. Chairman, 
that you share the information with the staff so we can look at 
that, because we could not find any information on that example 
right there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Mr. Nicol, the Majority is going to have us think that 
local communities are so overwrought by border crossers and 
things that they leave behind, that border communities should 
be thrilled to surrender their rights and their decision making 
to the Department of Homeland Security. That is not my 
experience from my own discussions with people in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">    However, how do border communities you have talked to, that 
you worked with, feel about surrendering these prerogatives or 
rights, essentially against their will? Do you think the right 
to clean water or due process is red tape? Number one. Because 
I think that we are minimizing the effect on people themselves 
that live there and have lived there for generations. I would 
like to know if you could respond to that, please.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Nicol">Thank you. I live in a border community. I live
in McAllen, Texas, just a few miles north of the border. The 
general feeling among people who are aware of the waiver of 
laws that is in place currently for the wall is a sense of 
offense. That we don't have the same level of legal protections 
that the rest of the country has. That someone in the interior 
of the Nation has the protection of the Safe Drinking Water 
Act, but the Safe Drinking Water Act was waived to build the 
border wall. All of my drinking water has to come through that 
to get to my home because all of my drinking water comes out of 
the Rio Grande.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Nicol">    We live in safe communities. McAllen is one of the safest 
communities in Texas. El Paso is one of the safest communities 
in the United States. Border communities are not over-run 
horrifying, dangerous war zones. They are safe. They are quiet. 
If anything, they are a little boring. The idea that we need to 
suspend the rule of law, and that only our safe communities get 
the rule of law suspended is, frankly, offensive to many people 
that I know.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"> And for local governments in those
communities, those towns, those counties, how do they feel 
about having their legal requirements subject to basically 
irrelevance by the Department of Homeland Security and Border 
Patrol?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> I think it is the same basic thing. It also
makes for a lot of legal uncertainty. You had the El Paso Water 
District challenge the waiver back in 2009 because they didn't 
know what their legal framework was to draw water out of the 
Rio Grande, if the laws had been waived, if the Clean Water Act 
and the Safe Drinking Water Act had been waived. So, I think it 
causes a tremendous amount of difficulty. It is a very broad-
brush approach to waive everything.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Mr. Judd, if I may, just one question. On February 2 of 
last year, San Diego's NBPC Local 1613 said in a tweet that 
appears to now have been deleted, ``It is morning in America. 
With new leadership having the will to secure the border, a 
Hemingway quotation follows: Certainly there is no hunting like 
the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long 
enough and liked it, never really care for anything else 
thereafter.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">    This tweet was deleted. I just want to ask you, do you 
stand by that quote or are you aware of that quote, Mr. Judd?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Judd"> I personally had that quote deleted. I made sure
that quote was deleted.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"> Why?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Judd"> I didn't think that quote was appropriate.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"> About the hunting of man?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Judd"> That is correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"> Thank you. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. 
Gohmert, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Mr. Nicol, in your testimony, you said, as I read it, 
``laws that are swept aside are not merely red tape. They are 
critical protections that were put in place for a reason--to 
protect people, their communities, and the environment that we 
depend on.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">    Is that your belief?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> Yes, it is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> But, apparently, it is only your belief when
it comes to certain laws, but it is not your belief regarding 
laws about our border. Would you be happier if there were no 
U.S.-Mexico border?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> I am concerned about a lot of different laws,
including----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> Let me ask it again, and listen real
carefully. Would you be happier if there were no U.S.-Mexico 
border?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> You would not. So, you are OK with a border as
long as it is not enforced and there is no wall, correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> The border has been enforced for a long time
before there was a wall. The wall is not necessary for----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Well, you are not answering my question.
Because the fact is, when we have a national park that allows 
people to come in, drug smugglers, to use the park at will, and 
they destroy the park, they leave tons of trash, and we cannot 
allow our enforcement people to go out there and stop them, 
then that is not enforcing the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">And when we put up a sign that, to me, is the most 
repugnant thing we can do to American citizens that says, look, 
basically, drug cartels have taken over our park, you will be 
safer if you don't use this area, go north of I-10, that is 
completely neglecting our duty as the U.S. Government and our 
oath to protect this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">    And I know you have such great judgment. I have certainly 
had my disagreements with Mr. Cornyn, our Senator, but isn't it 
true you said in response to John Cornyn's statement regarding 
Dreamers, ``He forgot to add that he is a tool with no scruples 
and his head looks like a thumb with a face drawn on it.'' 
Aren't those your words? It was your post, wasn't it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> And another post here, ``We all know Ted Cruz
is slimy and evil,'' and that, ``if he were to crawl back under 
the rock from whence he was spawned, the world would be a 
better place.'' That was one of your posts. But you also post 
that you would like to see more of a coming together between 
the sides. Isn't that right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> Those are personal, yes. But I do feel that it
would make far more sense to have immigration----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">All right. Well, let me ask you about this,
since I get to ask questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Another entry you had is that, ``It is important to have 
some historical perspective and understand the racist reasons 
that our immigration laws were put in place.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">    Let me ask you, have you ever heard of MS-13?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> You know who they are. Have you seen the kind
of hideous murders they have inflicted upon Americans in the 
United States? Have you seen that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> I have read about them, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> Yes. OK. And how about ISIS? You are familiar
with who and what ISIS is, correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> And you are aware that they have made plans,
and the FBI Director has testified that we now have ISIS in 
every state. He said there is an investigation in every state 
in the Union. Are you aware of that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">And it was the FBI Director, even though
people made fun of me for pointing out and quoting the FBI 
Director, he said that there are Middle Eastern terrorists who 
have changed their names to sound Hispanic and sneak across the 
U.S. border so that they can do damage in this country. That is 
also a threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">We also have people like Kim Jong-un that has made clear he 
wants to destroy our Nation. We also know that drug cartels' 
estimated about $80 billion or so last year that they brought 
in that has done massive damage on the rule of law in Mexico. 
It is why Mexico is not one of the top 10 economies in the 
country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">And, I would just suggest to you, that, hopefully, we will 
do as the Secret Service found when they raised the wall and 
the fence around the White House by 5 feet, fences and walls 
work. If they don't, as I told the head of the Secret Service, 
then tear down the wall around the White House. They haven't 
seen fit to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The gentleman's time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. 
Huffman, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Huffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Huffman">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the
witnesses for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Huffman">Environmental protections and bedrock environmental laws 
like NEPA are in place so that we can protect communities and 
the resources they depend on and provide an opportunity for 
public input into land management decisions. And, 
unfortunately, although I have heard my colleagues across the 
aisle many times say that local voices are the most important, 
it seems that it is only certain voices that matter and there 
is some selective listening going on. They seem to hear only 
the local voices that they agree with when it comes to things 
like national monuments and certainly with this rhetoric around 
border security we are hearing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Huffman">Ignoring tribal rights, community voices, and our country's 
laws, as some are proposing, doesn't help solve problems, but 
it does advance President Trump's very authoritarian, dystopic 
agenda. In fact, today, it looks like we are having a blue 
light special, a two-for-one on scapegoating. We get to 
scapegoat environmental laws and Mexicans at the same time, so 
what an irresistible opportunity for this authoritarian agenda.</paragraph>

back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Huffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Huffman">I think we might be able to obviate some of
the further delay and inquiry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Huffman">    The gentleman from Texas, when he interrupted and I did not 
yield, but he did ask a question during that point about his 
personal motivation, and I answered in the affirmative. I am 
happy to withdraw that because, frankly, my earlier point was a 
rhetorical point about the effect of the hearing and not about 
any individual Member's personal motivation. So, if withdrawing 
that colloquy, which I hadn't yielded for in any event, but I 
am happy to withdraw it, would move us forward, I would be 
happy to do that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> The gentleman from Texas.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> If I might respond. I would gladly accept that
withdrawal, but I hope the gentleman understands, under the 
rules of decorum, if someone uses words that impugn a Member of 
Congress' integrity or motivation, I know it is not normally 
polite to interrupt, but if there is no challenge to have the 
words taken down while that speaker is still speaking and 
present, then you waive the right, and that was why I 
interrupt. Otherwise, I would apologize for interrupting 
because it was your time, but that is the only time I have to 
make clear ``were you speaking directly to me?'' And on the 
gentleman's explanation, I appreciate it. And my request for 
his words to be taken down is withdrawn. Thank you.

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> Please add 1 minute to the clock.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Huffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Huffman">Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Gohmert.
And certainly, I don't offer any words about individual 
motivations, but my rhetorical point about the effect of this 
hearing being one of scapegoating Mexicans and the 
environmental laws at the same time, I stand by completely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Huffman">Now, Mr. Nicol, you have already pointed out that where 
border infrastructure projects fail to fully consider impacts, 
local communities were left to deal with the consequences of 
that. And you mentioned eco-tourism, which is a large part of 
your local border economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Huffman">According to a 2011 study, nature tourism contributes 
roughly $460 million to the economy in south Texas every year. 
Could you please elaborate on the economic impacts of the 
border wall that cut off the World Birding Center? And then, 
maybe also speak to how you expect increased wall construction 
to impact wildlife and related eco-tourism that drives economic 
development in border communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Huffman">    While you are at it, it has been suggested that protecting 
wildlife is perhaps a rationale for this wall. I found that 
very creative, almost as good as the one from the President 
about putting solar panels on the wall, and now suddenly, we 
are for renewable energy. This wall can mean many things to 
many people and, apparently, it is now a wildlife wall to some 
people. I would appreciate your thoughts on that rationale.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Nicol">Certainly. As far as eco-tourism is concerned,
the wall that is south of my house was built between a World 
Birding Center that a local community established to try to tap 
into the some of the eco-tourism dollars that come to south 
Texas every year. We are in a migratory flyaway. All the birds 
heading north and south from about the Rockies to the East 
Coast bottle up and come through our area. So, in the fall and 
the spring, eco-tourism and bird watching are a tremendous part 
of the local economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Nicol">The wall that was put up between the World Birding Center 
and the adjacent wildlife refuge, which is where all the 
habitat for the birds actually is, has a gate on it. The locals 
were promised that that gate would be opened during regular 
business hours. It has never been opened. There is a sign that 
points to it saying, ``Pedestrian walking trail this way,'' but 
the gates never open so the birders can't go there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Nicol">If the same thing is done at the Santa Ana National 
Wildlife Refuge, the National Butterfly Center, Bentsen-Rio 
Grande State Park, and World Birding Center, all of which are 
on the map for President Trump's proposed walls, we can expect 
the same sort of thing. And even if the gate is opened, it is 
hard to imagine that very many tourists would want to go 
between prison bars to go see the birds they are interested in. 
It is not a very good vacation option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Nicol">    As far as the wildlife is concerned, the levee wall in 
particular is terrible for wildlife because it takes an easy 
slope and turns it into a sheer cliff, essentially an 18-foot 
tall slab of concrete. And when we get floods, the wildlife is 
trapped, so you turn a wildlife refuge into a wildlife 
deathtrap. There is no way that an ocelot can get over that. 
People get over it pretty easily. There is usually a pile of 
ladders stacked up at the end of the wall. But for something 
that can't fly or can't build a ladder, the wall becomes a 
deathtrap.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Huffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Huffman"> What about the antelope that were referred to
earlier as being impacted by illegal immigration, an antelope 
or mobile migratory animals? Does the construction of a 
continuous border wall impact the wildlife corridors that 
species like that would normally----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> The antelope, that was out in Arizona. I have
read that report as well. The report did not say that it was 
just because of cross-border traffic. It was the whole package 
of enforcement and traffic that impacted those animals. So, it 
was also including the walls, the roads, patrols, helicopters, 
and everything else.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Huffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Huffman"> Thank you. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    If you notice, votes were just called, but we want to try 
to get one more round of questioning in. And I want to 
recognize the Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Bishop from 
Utah, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Bishop">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Bishop">Let me see if I can get a few of these things in here 
quickly and change the focus back to what we are talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    Mr. Arthur, very quickly, is there a conflict between the 
missions of the Interior Department and Homeland Security?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> They can work together, but they actually have
two very different missions. And, quite frankly, when they do 
work together, when we do enforce our----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> It works real well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> It works best, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Bishop">But that requires personality, which is
something we don't--we legislate on worst-case scenario, not on 
best-case personality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    Mr. Bell, is the violence that you are witnessing on the 
border increasing or decreasing? I knew the Krentz family. I 
feel bad about everything. Is it increasing?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Bell"> Where we have seen the access granted and the
infrastructure and the road systems come in, we see less 
activity if there is less conflict. We don't run into folks. 
There hasn't been very much violence in our area. We do know 
that assault on agents is up, though. I belong to the Citizens 
Advisory Committee for our Nogales Border Patrol Station, and 
the statistics are up on that. And we get briefed on that 
regularly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Bishop">OK. Mr. Judd, we are talking here not
necessarily about a wall. We are talking about access. The 
Border Patrol needs the access that happens to be there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    Have you served in other areas? You have served in Tucson, 
right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Judd"> I have. I have also served in California, Maine,
and Montana.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> How many apprehensions did you have in Maine in
a year?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Judd"> At my station, we had maybe two a year.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> A little bit fewer than in Tucson.

    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Bishop">Which means the history is somewhat cyclical.
It also means that each border area is different. And having a 
one-size-fits-all MOU probably does not meet all the 
circumstances. So, for example, historically, San Diego is the 
entrance port of choice, until they actually waived those 
iconic bedrock laws and build a fence, and then it kind of 
shifted over to the Tucson Sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    Rio Grande actually has more, but there is a different kind 
of personality going across. Rio Grande, a lot of those 
illegals that are coming across are kids, women, but in Tucson, 
isn't that mainly adults, males?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Judd"> It is, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Bishop">So, in each of these sectors, what we really
need to have for the Border Patrol to be effective is to give 
them flexibility to meet the differences of those situations 
and give them access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    This is what I really want you to talk to me about, because 
when we were down there, you explained why east-west access is 
so significant. If somebody is crossing the border illegally 
and you have the ability of finding that out, what is your 
method? What do you try to do to catch those people?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Well, what you want to do is you want to box
those individuals in between two agents, because if you can do 
that, your effectiveness goes sky high. Whereas, if you are 
chasing from behind, the chances of you actually catching those 
individuals are nearly none.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> So, to do that, you need different kinds of
access points, one at the border wall, one further up there, 
further up again. You need to be able to go behind the group as 
well as in front of the group.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Judd"> To be effective, we have to have those.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> And that is where the east-west access becomes
critical.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Absolutely.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> Do you have a problem with maintenance of
access routes that you already have?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Judd"> No, we don't.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> All right. But you do need significantly more,
as we were talking, were we in the Coronado at the time?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Judd"> We were, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> All right. Is there the ability of getting that
access point right along the border so you can have somebody 
behind as well as somebody in front?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Judd"> We could absolutely build a border road that
would help us be effective.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> Is it there now?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Judd"> It is not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> Why not?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Judd"> The environmental laws, frankly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> You mean to tell me that sometimes it takes so
long to get approval from the land managers, you don't even 
have time, you don't even ask the question?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Oftentimes, we just don't even want to go through
the process because we know what the outcome is going to be.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> Borderland has a specific meaning, correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Judd"> It does, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> It is 100 miles.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> It is different. And some of the frustrations I
have of, obviously, people who simply, I think, try to put 
their head in the sand and ignore that there is an opinion. 
Sometimes we make a decision that if we are giving Homeland 
Security the ability of making these kinds of decisions on 
local communities, aren't we already doing that with the 
Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture? 
Aren't they already making these arbitrary decisions on these 
local communities?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Judd"> They have, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> The difference is not significant, except that
the difference is national security has an interest in those 
areas. The difference is the topography. So, that Tucson Sector 
is 80 percent controlled by the Federal Government, and almost 
half of that is in wilderness area. You don't find that along 
the Texas border. You don't find that in Maine or Montana.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Judd"> No, you don't.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Bishop">What we need to do is make sure that we give
flexibility for access. Access has to be critical. If the 
Border Patrol does not have access, we cannot do our job with 
security. It is not the same thing as a wall. But that access 
becomes significant, and our environmental laws inhibit that 
access from taking place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    I yield back, in 1 second.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Great job. The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Westerman">There are several people still on the list to ask 
questions, so the Committee will stand in recess, and we will 
reconvene after votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    [Recess.]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The Committee will reconvene.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    I now recognize the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Gosar, for 
5 minutes of questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Gosar">    Mr. Judd, regarding Border Patrol agents that are under 
scrutiny for sabotaging water stashes set up by humanitarian 
groups and coyotes, who are aiding the commission of criminal 
crimes, what is the procedure for Border Patrol agents who find 
humanitarian groups or supply stashes along and around the 
border?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Judd">When you look at those pictures, what they are
not telling you is why we would dispose of that water. If that 
water heats up in the desert, it is actually a lot more 
dangerous to drink extremely heated water than what it is if 
you don't have that water at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Judd">    So, what our agents are doing is they are actually taking a 
humanitarian effort to try to save these individuals. And it is 
on record to the extraordinary length that we have gone to save 
individuals, including an agent that went into the Colorado 
River and lost his life trying to save somebody who had crossed 
the border illegally. We have procedures in which we try our 
best to be as humanitarian to those that we come in contact 
with at all times.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Are the agents actively dismantling supplies for
coyotes and individuals being smuggled?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Absolutely not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> About how much of the waste and garbage
throughout the borderlands comes from these humanitarian groups 
and the human and drug smugglers that they enable?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Judd"> A great deal. In fact, the vast majority of all
the trash that is left in the desert is left from smugglers, 
the people that cross the border illegally, and from these 
humanitarian groups that leave these water jugs and these food 
piles around.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Gosar">I have been to the border many times and have
witnessed it firsthand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Gosar">    In your view, would Border Patrol agents benefit from a 
clear plan and procedure for combating supposed humanitarian 
groups that are aiding and abetting and smuggling environmental 
pollution in felony border crossings?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Judd">Well, in fact, under the Obama administration, we
were not able to enter into these camps to extricate these 
individuals that crossed the border illegally, even if we had 
the foot sign that clearly showed that illegal aliens were 
entering into these humanitarian camps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Judd">    We know that these groups are helping people cross the 
border illegally, and that is just flat out against the law. If 
we are there to help for humanitarian purposes, that is 
perfect, but you can help through humanitarian purposes by 
reporting to the Border Patrol that people crossed the border 
illegally and let them know what hospital you are taking them 
to. But in reality, what they are doing is they are furthering 
the entrance of these individuals.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Well, to the law, they are aiding and abetting,
right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Judd"> They are.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> OK. Mr. Nicol, you stated in your written
testimony that there is no clear need to waive laws, 
environmental or otherwise, to facilitate Border Patrol 
activities. To make clear for the record, how many years of 
experience do you have in border security law enforcement?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> As a law enforcement officer, none.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Really? Can you say that again for the record?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> None.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Mr. Judd, in your decades of serving as a Border
Patrol agent, do you agree with Mr. Nicol's statements that the 
2006 MOU grants sufficient access to our agents to successfully 
deter illegal activity on the border?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Judd"> The way it is being implemented at this time,
absolutely not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Would there be any means to change that that you
would find would suffice to actually work?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Judd"> No. It needs to be rewritten.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Gosar">    Mr. Bell, your family has ranched land along the border for 
some 80 years. As someone who lives and works on the 
borderlands, your testimony included mention of violence, 
murder, and threats. Since the MOU was signed in 2006, have you 
seen these problems disappear?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Bell"> We have seen things get better on the border as
far as that is concerned. When we see infrastructure come in 
along the border, we actually see conditions get better. We see 
interactions with illegal border crossers diminish. We don't 
see the drug smugglers as much. But there are those chance 
occasions when you run into somebody and you don't know who you 
are confronting, so----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Can you give me a timeline? You have seen it get
better, let's say around November of 2016 and since that time?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Bell"> Yes, I have seen it actually get better prior to
that, actually. When they started to get these liaisons with 
the Forest Service in with the Border Patrol and actually work 
on projects to get roadways implemented on the border and 
infrastructure, like RVSS towers and IFT towers. Those were all 
done in coordination with the Forest Service.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> So, has the deterrence been sufficient as Mr.
Nicol would state?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Bell"> No. There is still a lot of smuggling going on in
the area. There are still a lot of groups coming through the 
area. And in fact, they are using the areas where the agents 
have less capability of patrolling. Right now, the biggest area 
on our ranch where drugs are being smuggled is through the 
wilderness area.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Oh, absolutely. I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Gosar">    My time has expired. I appreciate it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The gentleman's time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Westerman">We will now move into a second round of questions, and I 
recognize myself for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Mr. Judd, can you clarify what types of challenges you have 
that you face in order to conduct maintenance on tactical 
infrastructure? This is infrastructure that is already in 
place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    I know when I was at the border, we were in a vehicle, 
looked like it had new tires on it, but we spent part of the 
time changing a flat on the vehicle driving along the road that 
was on the border.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Judd">The main issue that we have with maintenance, if
we have a road, we can maintain that road, to answer Chairman 
Bishop's question. But the problem is, is we don't have north-
south access roads that allow us to get to the border roads 
that allow us to maintain it in a timely fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Judd">    To drive a road grader from, let's just say, the Naco or 
the Brian Terry Memorial Border Patrol Station to the Coronado 
National Forest, as opposed to driving that same road grader on 
the highway, taking it into the forest and then having that 
north-south access road, greatly diminishes the time. So, we 
have to have access to those roads.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> And, Mr. Arthur, in Mr. Nicol's testimony he
talked about the decrease in the amount of drugs coming over 
the southern border. Is that true? I thought there has actually 
been an increase in fentanyl and methamphetamine?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I
can tell you right now that the amount of fentanyl--and again, 
I cannot overstate the toxicity of this drug--the amount of 
fentanyl that we have seen has actually increased significantly 
month to month in the first 4 months of Fiscal Year 2018. It is 
almost as much as we saw in all of Fiscal Year 2017.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Westerman">OK. And, Mr. Judd, recently when I traveled
to the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector with Mr. Bishop, we 
witnessed the various effects of illicit border crossing 
activity. We were able to see firsthand how transnational 
criminal organizations utilize gaps in our border security to 
circumvent criminal operations. We saw these hideouts in the 
hills where the scouts operate from. And we know this can often 
lead to the creation of tunnels that are used for human 
trafficking and smuggling of narcotics. And I found out 
something else interesting when I was there, that the city of 
Nogales treats the sewage from Mexico and drugs actually get 
smuggled through the sewer system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    Can you lead us through the steps your agents must take 
after the discovery of a cross-border tunnel and what it takes 
to remediate that tunnel or fill it in?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Yes, it is a very difficult and lengthy process.
We have to contact, again, as per the National Environmental 
Policy Act, or NEPA, we have to contact several different 
agencies in order just to fill that tunnel in, which is what we 
are hoping to do. In remediating it, you are trying to take it 
back to its natural state. And it takes weeks, even months, to 
be able to take that tunnel back to its natural state because 
of the bureaucracy that is involved with these laws.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> Mr. Nicol, a report on the Cabeza Prieta
National Wildlife Refuge found almost 8,000 miles of ad hoc 
roads that were associated with illegal border crossings, and 
recommended Border Patrol be allowed to access the refuge and 
install tactical infrastructure. Since you believe the Border 
Patrol and security infrastructure are ineffective, what would 
you do to reduce the number of and the amount of damage that 
these unauthorized roads cause in the refuge?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> Many of those roads are being created by east-
west traffic, not just north-south traffic. One of the 
remediation efforts that has been undertaken at Cabeza Prieta 
and at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument has been to retire 
and repair unneeded roads, because those are used by smugglers 
the same way as they are used by Border Patrol agents. So, 
reducing the number of roads would not only help to remediate 
the damage, but it would also make it so that when you do have 
cross-border traffic, it is more concentrated in specific 
areas, which would in turn make it easier for Border Patrol to 
intercept.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> Mr. Judd, you spent a lot of time in this
area. Do you think these roads are mainly east-west or do you 
see north-south? The image we saw earlier looked like a vast 
web of ad hoc roads.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Judd"> The roads that Border Patrol agents use are east-
west, but the roads that the smugglers use are all north-south. 
I mean, they might go east-west for a couple hundred yards 
until they go north-south again, but they are all north-south.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Westerman">OK. My time has almost expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    I will now recognize Mr. Beyer for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Beyer">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. Mr.
Chairman, we are here today to talk about the border wall while 
the Senate is talking about immigration legislation, so I think 
it is only fair that I take a few minutes to express my extreme 
disappointment with how disingenuous this immigration 
conversation has been in Congress. I think the American public 
is being spun, confused, misled by the President and Republican 
congressional leadership, so let me set the record straight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Beyer">Number one, President Trump told us that Mexico would pay 
for the wall. Number two, Mr. Trump ended protection for 
Dreamers. Number three, now President Trump is insisting that 
we agree on his plan to limit immigration or else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Beyer">Trump insists he is a dealmaker, but nothing could be 
further from the truth. He says he wants a bipartisan deal, but 
then he says he won't support any that are brought to him. He 
says Mexico will pay for the wall. Now, he is begging for us to 
fund it. He says he wants to protect Dreamers, but he won't do 
it unless Congress agrees to limit legal immigration. And he is 
holding immigration conversations hostage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Beyer">This is reckless, period. The anti-immigrant right wants to 
build a border wall despite efforts that experts have said 
already decried because it doesn't make us any safer. And the 
anti-immigrant right wants to limit immigration, which is a 
fundamentally different conversation from anything that we have 
had before. No one was talking about this before because it is 
truly radical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Beyer">Our economy needs immigration to be competitive and a lead. 
We need to protect our Dreamers, and nearly 80 percent of 
Americans and a vast majority of Republicans agree this must 
happen. We need to look at our high-skilled immigrants and per 
country caps, for example, House Bill H.R. 392. We need the 
American Hope Act, a meaningful bill for Dreamers, or my bill 
with Congressman Espaillat and Bonamici, the Protecting 
Sensitive Locations Act, or Congresswoman Chu's Reuniting 
Families Act. We need meaningful discussion on temporary 
protective status. Congressman McGovern has a bill pushing 
this. We need meaningful treatment toward refugees, like 
Congressman Pascrell and Cicilline have been pushing. And we 
need meaningful access to health services, like Congresswoman 
Lujan Grisham has been advocating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Beyer">But that is not our conversation. We are not being heard. 
The scared children and families are not being heard. Arguments 
about merit ignore that we already have merit in our system. 
Yes, it needs tweaks. The skills-based visa system is not 
perfect, but that is not the conversation we are having. Family 
reunification is now called chain migration, but we all 
understand the importance of family reunification. President 
Trump's own wife brought her parents here through that family 
reunification system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Beyer">So, let's be real. Let's eliminate the coded language that 
tries to make us more comfortable with a nativist and even 
racist immigration policy. Look, we are all children, 
grandchildren, great grandchildren of immigrants, mostly when 
there were little or no immigration restrictions, and there 
were certainly no walls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Beyer">Mr. Chairman, that is the end of my formal statement, but I 
do have a question or two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Beyer">    Mr. Nicol, in your testimony, you mention that the waiver 
to build roads and public lands is not only environmentally 
destructive, but can be counterproductive to border security 
efforts. We have heard a lot about the east-west walls needed 
just on the side. Can you give an example how the public roads 
could be counterproductive?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Nicol">Probably the best documented example is in the
San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge. They are in an area 
that is very fissured and eroded and has deep crevices that 
someone cannot drive through. A patrol road was built along the 
southern edge of the refuge. That patrol road involved filling 
in lakes that are used by endangered fish. It didn't work very 
well because they got their bulldozers stuck when they tried to 
just dump dirt into it. But once the road was built, the refuge 
reported, in 2008, that that road was being used by smugglers, 
and that areas that previously had not seen any cross-border 
vehicle activity because one could not drive a vehicle through, 
were now being used by smugglers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Nicol">    There may well be other examples that have not been as well 
documented. That one, because you have land banners on the 
ground observing it, has been.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Beyer"> One more question. In Mr. Judd's written
testimony, he described the need for some Border Patrol agents 
to use horses to patrol public lands as ``absurd.'' As someone 
who lives on the border, do you think it is absurd that the 
Border Patrol may need to use horses as transports in some 
cases?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> For me?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. Beyer"> Yes, Mr. Nicol.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> Sure. I think that it makes a lot of sense in
certain areas. It doesn't make sense to create a road when a 
horse is a more effective way to get across that terrain. There 
are some very rugged parts of the border where a horse is just 
the most appropriate and most effective way to get from point A 
to point B.

    <paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Beyer"> Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. 
Gosar, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Mr. Judd, Mr. Nicol made a comment about it is
easier to pick up trash than building a wall. You are familiar 
with lower Santa Cruz, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> I am, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> What happens in the lower Santa Cruz? Mexico is
high ground. We are low ground in Arizona. So, what ends up 
happening, we get this episodic flooding, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Judd"> And we get a lot of trash washed into our areas.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Not just trash, but sewage, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Yes, correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> OK. Mr. Arthur, when we start looking at
disease, I would talk about trash with disease, is the 
antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis advancing in the United 
States or receding?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> I know that we have seen incidents of
antibiotic tuberculosis in the United States. The source of it, 
I cannot actually identify, but I believe it is increasing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Well, epidemiology-wise, in Arizona, it is
moving farther north. OK? We have tons of illegals that come 
in, because we are one of the ones that actually have the 
treatments for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Gosar">    So, where I am going with this is, the lower Santa Cruz, we 
made a comment about a wall. So, Mr. Judd, if we were to build 
a management of water with Mexico, would that actually be as 
good as a wall?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Judd"> I am sorry?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Like an infrastructure project where we actually
mitigate the process and direct water along the mitigation, 
along the lower Santa Cruz.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Absolutely. What we need to do is we need to be
able to keep anything that is flowing from Mexico into the 
United States that could be bringing trash, sewage, or anything 
like that. And whether that is a wall, whether that is building 
an infrastructure with Mexico, we just need to be able to keep 
that out from the United States.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Let me ask you another question. Maybe you can't
answer, but I have the answer. When you do something along the 
international border between Mexico, the United States, and 
Arizona, who helps pay for it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Judd"> The United States does, as far as I know.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Can you say it? What is the other country south
of us?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Judd"> I don't know very much that Mexico pays for
anything.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> No, but Mexico would pay for that on an
infrastructure----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Oh, yes. In that case, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> Absolutely, so once again, President Trump said,
``no, Mexico would pay for it,'' well, this is a creative way 
of looking at something that actually mitigates trauma to our 
infrastructure aspects that both sides take care of. And it is 
even better than a wall.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Gosar">We can actually extrapolate that to Nogales
because of the wastewater problem. Once again, we have rampant 
sewage coming into the United States from Mexico. When we do 
the wastewater aspect, we are the low ground, they are high 
ground. So, we can actually mitigate this and it makes it 
something that both countries mitigate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Gosar">    Oh, by the way, let me ask you the question. There is also 
another tribe down there, right, the Tohono O'odham that are 
along that border as well?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Judd"> That is correct, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Gosar"> So, this might be an interesting facade in
regards to a mitigation on how we look at border security with 
an infrastructure project, would it not?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Judd"> It would, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Gosar">Wow. Interesting. But I guess I am the racist,
because that is what was said here. It is disingenuous for my 
colleagues on the other side to say that. Over and over again, 
that is all I hear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Gosar">You know what, there is an old analogy: ``Look in the 
mirror. The enemy is me.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Gosar">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Mr. Westerman">We will do one more round of questioning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    Mr. Arthur, you stated that you observed environmental 
concerns in your recent visit to the Rio Grande Valley Sector 
that hinders border security. Can you please explain the 
problems that agents face there? We have been talking about the 
Tucson Sector in Arizona, but let's look at some other areas 
along the border.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> The main issue that I saw when I was down there
was carrizo cane. Carrizo cane is an invasive species that 
grows along the banks of the Rio Grande River. And to quote The 
New Yorker, ``it forms a grassy forest along the border within 
which visibility is roughly 12 to 24 inches and makes an 
excellent hiding space.'' It is also a woody substance. It is 
very difficult to get through. Once smugglers, once any sort of 
cross-border traffic, enter that cane, it is next to impossible 
to find it. There are cane eradication projects, but the cane 
remains. And for some reason, nothing has been done. The 
curious thing is that when I stood on the bluffs of Roma, 
Texas, and I stared across the river at Ciudad Miguel Aleman, I 
believe it is, I actually saw Mexican workers cutting the cane 
on the other side of the border, when I looked down and I saw 
the cane growing along our own border. I don't know why we 
still have it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Mr. Nicol, in your opening statement, you
mentioned the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge as an 
example where border security infrastructure has failed. But 
you failed to note that Border Patrol's access to the refuge 
must be negotiated at the supervisor's level on a case-by-case 
basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    Do you think that if Border Patrol had more immediate 
access to the refuge's roads, it would deter illegal 
immigration and drug smugglers from using those roads?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> I think that the interaction between the land
management agencies and Border Patrol for any kind of 
interdiction efforts where they are both having jurisdiction is 
critical.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Westerman">I want to change the format here just a
little bit. We asked a lot of questions, but there may be 
something on your mind that you think the Committee needs to 
hear that we haven't asked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    Mr. Bell, I want to start with you. Are there any other 
issues regarding border security, environmental laws, 
regulations and access that you think we need to hear?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Bell">Well, it just doesn't stop with getting access to
the border and waiving rules. We still need other things. We 
have to make sure there are boots on the ground. We have to 
make sure that we have aerial assets. We have to make sure they 
have the technology. All those things coupled together. But it 
doesn't stop there either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Bell">    We need to make sure there is the infrastructure in place 
in the courts that allow for timely prosecutions and a judicial 
system that is willing to put out consequences. Only then can 
we really see a change if we impose consequences on folks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Being from Arkansas and making a trip down
to the border like I did recently, it was really eye-opening to 
me the vastness of the land there, the issues that the agents 
face, the obstacles that are in their way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    Mr. Judd, I want to ask you, is there something else you 
think the Committee should know that would enhance the Border 
Patrol's ability to do their job in regards to rules and 
regulations and environmental policy that currently is on the 
books?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Judd</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Judd"> Absolutely. I think that the main issue that we
currently face is the access that we have to these public 
lands. Horse patrol is extremely important, and we always have 
to have horse patrol. But if we cannot respond in a timely 
manner to activity that is currently happening on the border, 
we are never going to be able to control the border and we are 
never going to be able to secure the border. Without that 
access, and without us being able to stop those people from 
entering into the country, we will never be able to secure the 
border.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Another thing I noticed there was that it is
a system of protection with walls and roads and remote-sensing 
equipment. And access is a critical component of that. Even if 
you have a wall in a remote area, people could figure out how 
to breach that. And if you can't access it, you can't stop 
them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    Mr. Arthur, do you have anything to add to that on anything 
the Committee should know that you haven't had a chance to tell 
us?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Mr. Arthur">Absolutely. I would commend to the Committee
Section 118, Division C, Title I of the Securing America's 
Future Act. It will respond to a lot of the issues that Agent 
Judd and Mr. Bell have raised today about Border Patrol agents 
having their hands tied. Basically, what it would do is it 
would waive a variety of laws in very critical situations when 
Border Patrol needs to get access and needs to provide crucial 
infrastructure along the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Mr. Arthur">    In fact, I would expand it to include all laws so that 
state laws are not able to stop this critical work.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> The Chair now recognizes Mr. Beyer for 5
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Mr. Beyer">Thank you, Mr. Chair, very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Mr. Beyer">    Mr. Nicol, I want to ask you about flooding. My friend Mr. 
Gosar talked about Nogales. There is the waiver authority in 
the border wall. What happened in 2008 in Nogales?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Nicol">In 2008, seasonal monsoon rains that hit this
area every 3 to 5 years came through Sonora and Nogales, 
Arizona. Rainfall that goes kind of from uphill in Mexico to 
downhill into the United States was dammed by the border wall 
that separates the two cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Nicol">In addition to the wall above ground, there had been a wall 
built below ground, without discussion with the International 
Boundary Water Commission, that backed up water that was going 
through the drainage culvert underneath and caused the road 
above to heave up so that water was flowing along the top and 
pouring out of the ground. Water on the Mexican side was about 
up to the door frames. On the U.S. side, it was ankle deep. 
Hundreds of buildings were damaged and two people drowned in 
Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Nicol">    After that, there were efforts to retrofit border walls 
where they cross washes, but after that retrofitting occurred 
in 2011, water backed up behind a section of border wall in 
Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a section that had been 
retrofitted. It then went over the top of the obstruction, 
carved out the foundation of the wall, and blew out a 60-foot 
wide section. We were told that that was an error and would not 
occur again, but in 2014 it occurred again, just outside of 
Nogales.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Beyer"> Would a NEPA analysis have made any difference
in Organ Pipe National Monument or Nogales?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> More than likely, because the land managers at
Organ Pipe, before the wall went up, foresaw that walls were 
going to obstruct debris that would be going down awash during 
a flood. They actually commissioned a channel morphology report 
to be done as a baseline so they could see how it changed 
before the wall and after the wall. So, they saw it coming.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Beyer">In my statement the last round, I complained
about how candidate Trump and President Trump had promised that 
Mexico was going to pay for the wall. In his Fiscal Year 2019 
budget we just got the other day, it has an $18 billion request 
for building the border wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, 
including 65 miles in the Rio Grande Valley. We all know that 
initial estimates tend to go way up. But my friend, Mr. Gosar, 
made some comment about how Mexico was actually paying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Mr. Beyer">I was going to ask Congressman Gosar, but he left, anyone 
understand what he said and could explain that to me, how 
currently we are expecting Mexico to pay for this wall, or some 
parts of it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Beyer">    This is a friendly question. It would have been a friendly 
question for him.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> If I could, Mr. Beyer, I believe that the
statement had to do with levee walls being built on either side 
of the border. And if there were to be a levee on the United 
States side and a levee on the Mexican side, that, in fact, 
would be a border wall that Mexico would pay for.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Mr. Beyer"> OK. Do we anticipate that much of the remaining
wall that has to be built along the Mexican border is going to 
be these parallel levees?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> That I can't answer. But it actually goes
exactly to the point that Mr. Nicol made, because what he was 
saying was, if you put a wall on one side and you don't have a 
wall on the other, you end up having a flood control problem. 
If you cure the flood control problem, you cure it on both 
sides, and that is one way that you would alleviate the 
problem.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Beyer"> But we are also depending on Mexico deciding
that they have to build a wall on their side.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Arthur"> As I said, I was surprised to see the
Mexicans--there seems to be this impression that the Mexicans 
don't care about border security. This is a real bread-and-
butter issue for them because they don't want the gangs in 
their country either. That is why I saw them cutting the 
carrizo cane in Ciudad Miguel Aleman. They don't want this, so, 
quite frankly, it is possible that that could happen.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Beyer">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Beyer">    Mr. Nicol, you talked about the Tohono O'odham Nation. It 
is a long history with the Border Patrol. Nevertheless, I 
understand that a waiver is used to construct a vehicle barrier 
across their land. Can you describe how that waiver affected 
the Tohono O'odham Nation?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nicol</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Nicol"> They have complained that it has made it more
difficult for them to interact with tribal members on both 
sides of the border. Their nation pre-exists the border being 
placed there. It restricts access to sacred sites and to family 
on the south of the border. And they have come out very 
strongly against converting that vehicle barrier into a 
pedestrian barrier as has been proposed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Beyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. Beyer"> OK. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Westerman">I, again, want to thank all the witnesses for your valuable 
testimony, and the Members, to those that are still here, for 
our questions. The members of the Committee may have some 
additional questions for the witnesses, and we will ask you to

for 10 business days for their responses.</paragraph>
