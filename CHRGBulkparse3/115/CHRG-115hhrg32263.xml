    <Doc-title>AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR 2019</Doc-title>
    <paragraph paraId="0" speaker="">J. CHRISTOPHER GIANCARLO, CHAIRMAN, U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Good morning, and the subcommittee will come
to order. And this is our first hearing for 2018 for the Ag 
Subcommittee where we will be looking at the 2019 budget 
request for the Commodities Future Trading Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">So, while it has been an interesting and we have had a busy 
year so far with ongoing discussions and negotiations revolving 
around funding levels for the current fiscal year, our full 
committee chairman, Mr. Frelinghuysen, has requested that we 
begin our work and start reviewing the President's budget 
request for 2019. And during this extremely busy time for my 
colleagues, I appreciate my colleagues for taking time to be 
here, of course, and certainly our ranking member, Mr. Bishop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">This is my sixth year to chair the Ag Subcommittee of 
Appropriations, and as I have done in past years, we are 
establishing goals for the subcommittee as we make our way 
through the fiscal year 2019 appropriations process: The first 
goal is to bolster prosperity and economic wellbeing in rural 
America and the farm economy; the second goal, conduct fair and 
transparent oversight to agencies' activities and public 
resources; third, promote economic growth through effective and 
efficient regulation and minimization of regulatory overreach; 
and, last, and certainly not least, to protect the health and 
safety of people, plants and animals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission continues to face 
new challenges as an ever-shifting swaps, futures, and option 
markets adapt to evolutions in technology and to the new actors 
which enter and operate within these markets. Meanwhile, we so 
often hear the phrase in my home State of Alabama that the 
agency must maintain its roots that grew out of the agriculture 
sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">We will discussion the President's fiscal year 2019 budget 
request of $281.5 million and other matters related to the 
Commission. The President's request, budget request, is in line 
with the Commission's own request and includes the repeated 
proposal many prior administrations have made to fund a portion 
of the Commission with user fees, an issue that we think should 
be left up to the authorizing committee to debate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">The CFTC has been a popular topic of conversation over 
years, and we will discuss some of the management and budget 
issues that have arisen during and prior to your term as 
Chairman and what you have done to address them. Additionally, 
I am sure that some policy issues will arise, not the least of 
which will be the topic of bitcoin futures and 
cryptocurrencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Briefly, I would like to recognize one of your 
accomplishments, Mr. Chairman, that I have brought up over the 
years, and it is related to the topic of leasing costs and 
related issues. Last year, you informed the committee that you 
were able to actually save money on your Kansas City office 
lease over its lifetime, and the committee wants to commend you 
for this action, and it is one that I requested of your 
predecessors on numerous occasions. And we will revisit this 
matter to ensure that we actually see that it materializes in 
savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">With regard to new developments in the marketplace, I have 
spoken before on the need for the Commission to invest in 
technology, and that is why we have included a set-aside 
specifically for this purpose each fiscal year of my 
chairmanship. This is the best way for the Commission to 
leverage its resources in terms of enforcement and allowing for 
new innovation in the marketplace. Simply hiring more people 
won't stop the advanced degrees to which algorithmic trading 
and cryptocurrencies go to rip-off customers inside the 
marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Over the past 8 years, we have had a healthy debate on this 
subcommittee over the size of the swap markets. I was glad to 
see the Commission weighing in on this matter and look forward 
to exploring it further. I think most everyone on this 
subcommittee was glad to see a single market could equate to 
several times the size of the entire world's economy, and very 
curious of how that happens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">But, Chairman Giancarlo, we look forward to discussing 
these matters with you as we start our hearing today. There is 
a lot of work before this Congress and this administration and 
your agency in order that we keep moving in the right 
direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Finding the right balance between over-regulation and a 
safe and effective marketplace is essential, and it fits within 
the main focus of this subcommittee, which is to find the right 
size for your agency's budget. Again, thank you for being here, 
and we look forward to the discussion today and as we go 
through the members as they ask questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">And before I do recognize the ranking member, Mr. Bishop, 
for his opening statement, I would remind everyone that we will 
try our best to strictly adhere by the 5-minute rule. And when 
you are asked to speak, please push the talk button on your 
microphone, and then you will be ready to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">    Mr. Bishop, thank you again for your presence and for your 
work on subcommittee, and the floor is yours.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bishop">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I
appreciate your cordiality and our working together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bishop">I would like to again take this opportunity to welcome Mr. 
Giancarlo, Chairman, to our subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bishop">We find ourselves again in the uncomfortable position of 
having a hearing on the agency's 2019 budget request when we 
haven't finalized the 2018 appropriation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bishop">Last year, the CFTC and OMB differed on the funding level, 
but this year, it appears that the request is on the same page, 
which makes our jobs a little easier. As I said last year, CFTC 
is extremely relevant to our farmers, our ranchers, and persons 
and other industries who use financial instruments to hedge 
their risk. I don't want to be the prophet of doom and gloom, 
but we need to understand the damage that our economy suffered 
in the Great Recession. We lost about 8\1/2\ million jobs. The 
unemployment rate increased from 4.7 to 10.1 percent in October 
of 2009. Ten million families lost their homes, and nearly a 
quarter of a million small businesses had to close their doors 
for good. Many on Wall Street and elsewhere tell us that those 
days will never come again, and we hope that that is true. We 
don't know that, and the historical record may suggest 
otherwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Bishop">Dodd-Frank has been the biggest defense that we have had 
against another catastrophe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Bishop">I know, Chairman Giancarlo, that you are not one who wants 
to undo or unravel Dodd-Frank, and we thank you for that. You 
have reached across the aisle to me and to my colleagues, and I 
also thank you for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Bishop">I look forward to working with you, and I look forward to 
your testimony today. And I thank you for the opportunity to 
welcome the Chairman, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    And at this time, I will yield back my time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Thank you, Mr. Bishop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">    Chairman Giancarlo, without objection, your entire written 
testimony will be included in the record, and I recognize you 
now for your statement, and then we will proceed with 
questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Thank you, Chairman Aderholt, and thank you,
Ranking Member Bishop and members of the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">For over a century, U.S. business and farmers have relied 
on commodity futures and derivative markets to hedge their cost 
of production. These markets have allowed farmers and ranchers 
to control production risk and commodity prices so that 
Americans, ordinary Americans, can find plenty of food on 
grocery store shelves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">These markets influence the price and availability of 
everything from heating fuel in American homes, the energy used 
in factories, the interest rates that borrowers pay on home 
mortgages, and the returns that workers earn on their 
retirement savings. Derivatives serve the need of society to 
help moderate price, supply, and other commercial risks to free 
up capital for economic growth, job creation, and overall 
prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Our fiscal year 2019 budget reflects the true needs of a 
policy setting and civil law enforcement agency to ensure that 
our derivative markets operate effectively. At a time when 
these markets are rapidly transforming with new digital 
technologies, this budget will provide the resources we need to 
oversee markets that are safe and competitive at home and 
abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">In fiscal year 2019, we are requesting $281.5 million and 
716 full-time equivalents. This is an increase of $31.5 million 
and 46 FTEs in current resources. It is the same level of 
funding that the Commission requested in fiscal year 2018. When 
I appeared before this subcommittee last year, I spoke about 
our approach to budgeting. The approach is based upon my 
experience in the private sector, where each dollar budgeted 
had to serve the core mission. It is not based on using a prior 
year's budget and adding a percentage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">So, working with our leadership team, we built this budget 
up from zero. Every dollar we seek properly serves the agency's 
mission to foster open, transparent, competitive, and 
financially sound markets free from fraud and manipulation, 
while respecting the American taxpayer through careful 
management of our resources. And I am certain, as I sit here 
today, that the $281.5 million is the right level of funding 
for the CFTC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Since becoming Chairman, I have made efforts to normalize 
operations and maximize resources. That means a return to 
greater care and precision in rule drafting, more thorough 
econometric analysis, and a right size docket of new rules and 
regulations to be absorbed by the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">As you know, modern financial technology is transforming 
our derivative markets. We must respond with a regulatory 
framework that stays ahead of the curve to harness those 
innovations. The CFTC seeks appropriate funding to set and 
enforce rules that foster innovation while promoting market 
integrity and confidence. This includes resources for our 
LabCFTC initiative to prepare us to be a 21st century digital 
regulator. The budget request also seeks to boost the CFTC's 
analytical expertise and monitoring of systemic risk, 
especially with central counterparty clearinghouses. This 
includes the expansion of sophisticated econometric and 
qualitative analysis for risk modeling, stress testing, and 
other stability-related evaluations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">As market regulators, we must take every step to thwart 
cyber attacks on the world's financial markets. That is why, in 
fiscal year 2019, we will devote more resources to 
cybersecurity, especially our examination of critical market 
infrastructure providers. The day after the White House 
announced its intention to nominate me as chairman, I issued a 
warning to those who would manipulate America's derivative 
markets. I said: There will be no pause, no let-up, and no 
reduction in our duty to enforce the law and punish wrongdoing; 
the American people are counting on us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Full funding of our budget request will allow us to 
continue to send a clear signal to the marketplace that we will 
punish bad behavior and compensate its victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">In closing, Mr. Chairman, I am reminded of a quote from 
Winston Churchill: We shall not fail or falter. We shall not 
weaken or tire. Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">I am grateful for your consideration of our budget request. 
With the right tools, we will do the job of overseeing American 
markets that are safe and competitive, markets that help grow 
our economy and increase our prosperity. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    [The statement of J. Christopher Giancarlo follows:]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Let me start out talking a little bit about bitcoin and 
cryptocurrencies. The advent of new futures approved just last 
year for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seem to have taken 
up the headlines recently. And we read stories of people 
mortgaging their homes to invest in the market and those that 
have thrown away their bitcoin keys wanting to go through the 
city dumps and try to recover them in some way. Millionaires 
were made and lost overnight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">    You briefly mentioned the steps you are taking to regulate 
the market in your written statement. Can you go a bit further 
into detail as to what role your agency plays regarding the 
regulation of this market and what other role agencies have?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for that. You
know, the amount of press coverage on this whole issue of 
virtual currencies far outweighs the impact of the entire 
marketplace on either the U.S. or the global economy. 
Nevertheless, it is, as you say, very, very much in the news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">The approach we are taking at the CFTC is really sixfold. 
And briefly--and then I will come back to it--it is to assert 
our legal authority where appropriate; increase our staff 
competency in the entire matter, our understanding of these 
products; and then a very robust consumer education effort to 
make sure what we understand is translated to the marketplace; 
very aggressive enforcement against fraud and manipulation in 
these markets; and then interagency cooperation, working very 
carefully with our fellow regulators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">And let me just go back and talk about that a little bit. 
As you know, the CFTC's authority is to regulate derivative 
markets comprehensively. That means setting standards for 
operation of trading platforms in derivatives, all of their 
financial adequacy, system safeguards, cyber requirements, 
customer handling, the full gamut, when it comes to derivative 
markets, so derivatives on any given asset, in this case, 
virtual currencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">When it comes to underlying spot markets, whether those are 
markets for commodities, whether they are markets for precious 
metals, we do not have regulatory authority. What we do have is 
fraud and manipulation authority, the ability to bring 
enforcement actions for fraud and manipulation in underlying 
markets. That has been the case for our history at the CFTC, 
and that is now how we approach virtual currencies. So, in the 
case of the two launched bitcoin futures at the CME and CBOE, 
we have comprehensive regulatory oversight. In the case of 
underlying cash markets--well, they are not really cash markets 
because they are trading in bitcoin--what we will call spot 
markets in bitcoin, our authority is limited to enforcement for 
fraud and manipulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">We have been active on both of those levels. And in the 
case of fraud and manipulation, we brought three cases just in 
January alone. And just yesterday, a Federal judge in New York, 
in response to a motion to dismiss by the defendants in this 
case, ruled in favor of the CFTC and confirmed our jurisdiction 
in these products as commodities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    In the case of the bitcoin futures exchanges, the two that 
I mentioned, our approach to this is comprehensive. So, 
whereas, spot bitcoin markets are, you might say, dark markets, 
in the case of bitcoin futures, they are lit markets. There is 
public transparency in our weekly Commitment of Traders report, 
but there is full regulatory transparency in terms of everybody 
who is transacting on those markets, and we know their 
positions. We know they are--it is not an anonymous market as 
it is, or a pseudo-anonymous market, as it is in the underlying 
spot markets. It is a fully disclosed market. It is a margined 
market. It is a full KYC, know your customer, antimoney 
laundering marketplace. So they are comprehensively regulated 
and are highly margined. And I might mention, as a final point, 
in the recent market disruption on the 5th and 6th of February, 
not a single margin breach in bitcoin futures market. So that 
is our jurisdiction, and that has been our approach in those 
areas, Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Let me move quickly. Recently, you made some
comments regarding the right sizing of the swaps markets, and, 
of course, it is refreshing to see someone else that raises 
those questions that this subcommittee has raised in the past 
about the notional size of swap markets. In fact, I believe you 
mentioned these questions in your recent speech at a derivative 
conference in New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Following the financial crisis of 2008, the swaps market 
became a topic of much debate in the public discourse. And the 
only number being thrown around was that of notional value. At 
the time, the number discussed was in excess of $600 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Can you take just a minute, before I recognize Mr. Bishop, 
and just explain the difference between notional value and the 
new metrics you are using and the number associated with each?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">                        ENTITY-NETTED NOTIONALS
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">So thank you for that. In fact, it was this
committee who wrote to the CFTC a few years ago and asked us if 
we could have a more precise measurement of what the true risk 
presented by these derivative markets are, and it was one of 
the first tasks that I assigned to our new chief economist when 
he joined the agency to do some research and see if we could 
provide some light here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">For years, the notional value of these derivative markets 
have been cited, often in requests for funding and other areas 
in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. And, yet, as we have 
long known in the marketplace, many of those positions are 
netted against each other to the neutral position. So, if you 
ask yourself, what is the true risk, well, the analysis we 
did--and we call it entity-netted notional, is our new 
nomenclature--applying this approach to $179 trillion of 
interest rate swaps, nets that down to $15 trillion. And if you 
use the $15 trillion, the whole thing suddenly makes sense 
because the measurement of the size of the U.S. Treasury market 
is $16 trillion. The size of the U.S. mortgage market is $15 
trillion. The size of the U.S. corporate bond market is $12 
trillion. Suddenly, the interest rate swaps market at $15 
trillion makes sense in comparison to markets that we have 
normally sized in these ways. Suddenly, this $100 trillion 
measure that has been put on the swaps markets I think comes 
down to its true risk element and what it is vis-a-vis the 
other markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    Now, this notion has been put forward in scholarly papers. 
We are looking for peer review. I think there are some good 
uses for this, but I don't think it necessarily addresses every 
issue. So I don't want to say that we have come up with the 
last word on this, but we have certainly come up, I think in 
some cases, with the first word on this in getting to something 
that is really the true measurement of the risk profile of our 
global derivative markets.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> As my time is far gone, Mr. Bishop.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Bishop">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Bishop">Mr. Giancarlo, in the hearing last year, I asked for your 
views on using user fees to supplement or fund the CFTC, and 
you were commendably frank, as usual, and you said, quote: I am 
very concerned that imposing transaction costs on our markets 
will contribute to greater liquidity challenges than we now 
have. And so I do not support user fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Bishop">The 2019 budget request, which OMB and CFTC both support, 
calls for user fees to pay for the $31.5 million increase over 
the fiscal year 2017 level of $250 million. It looks like the 
administration moved from its 2018 position of a freeze at $250 
million in exchange for your endorsement of a user fee of $31.5 
million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    Do you know now support user fees? And I would note that 
you may get the short end of the deal because Congress has been 
resistant for decades to CFTC user fees. If that continues to 
be the case, is the administration's position that the budget 
should be $250 million?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Thank you, ranking member. If I may begin
with just a distinction between user fees as a whole and then 
perhaps a subset of that, which would be transaction fees. I 
have long been opposed to transaction fees and remain opposed 
to transaction fees because they provide a tax on the use of 
these risk-hedging markets. And my concern there is, that we--
when you think about the very folks that this committee is 
concerned with, farmers and ranchers, you know, they face an 
array of risk-hedging mechanisms. One, of course, is our 
commercial futures--ag futures markets. Another, in cases where 
they are interchangeable, is crop insurance. And we, in a 
sense, don't want to put a tax on one that is not on the other. 
We want them to make choices in their economic interests and 
not face a taxation in the form of transaction fees.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> That seems like it is just nomenclature: a user
fee or a tax. I mean, you know, a rose is still a rose. It 
seems to me that it is just a matter of calling one a tax and 
one a user fee. It seems like they are one and the same because 
it goes to the people who actually use it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Ranking Member, I will note that every
administration going back to Ronald Reagan has proposed user 
fees. And this administration is in favor as well, similar to 
their predecessor, and it is in our budget. At the end of the 
day, it is for this committee to decide how much we are funded, 
and so our appropriators decide what that is. We will employ 
whatever tools our ppropriators and our authorizers put before 
us.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> I am not going to try to put a wedge between
you and the administration. Let me move on to diversity. At the 
last hearing and in the meetings we have had, we discussed 
diversity at CFTC. And a couple of questions on the topic. 
Could you update us on what the agency has done on diversity, 
including recruiting? Could you tell us whether you were able 
to offer paid internships the past summer to the 11 students 
who accepted internships? Have you had permanent staff from 
those internships? Can you describe the strategic workforce 
plan that includes increasing minorities and women in positions 
at CFTC?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Thank you for that. As we discussed last
time we met, we are committed to a strong diversity program at 
the agency, not just in our employment practices but also in 
our recruitment efforts. For 2 years now, we have had a 
summer--a diversity-based summer internship program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    With our current funding, we have not been able to offer 
paid stipends. We would like to think with the budget proposal 
before the Committee--we would be able to offer modest, quite 
modest, stipends.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> Excuse me. You found funds for podcasts in a
frozen budget. And you also spent $365,000 on your fintech 
initiative between May and November. Those funds could have 
helped pay for the cost of those interns, couldn't it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Well, money is fungible. We do have a core
mission in consumer education. We have a core mission in trying 
to stay ahead of the curve in terms of the rapidly changing 
nature of these markets. So we believe those were well-spent 
funds, but as you know, we are committed to diversity-based 
recruitment. And we would like to be in a position, and with 
the budget proposal we have before you, we would be able to 
offer a modest stipend to interns.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> And that is without the user fees?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> With the budget number of the $281.5 million
that is before the committee, we would be able to.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> If you only get the 250 without the user fees?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Ranking member, if we only get the 250, we
will be making a lot of hard choices at the agency, 
significantly hard choices.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> Thank you. I think my time is up.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> Dr. Harris.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Harris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Harris">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Harris">    And welcome back. Let me first just followup on something 
that we have spoken about before, which is swap dealer de 
minimis levels. And I think that you have--you delayed the 
effective date of the reduction from $8 billion to $3 billion, 
but actually I guess, in response to one of your--to your 
response to the chairman, is it because you are looking at this 
idea of entity-related notional value and we have been basing 
this all on gross notional value? Is that why there is a delay 
in what the final ruling will be?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">That is not the reason for the delay. The
reason for the delay is, is that any change in that de minimis 
will require a commission vote. I only received two additional 
Commissioners last September because of the way the 
confirmation process went in the Senate. The amount of data to 
be analyzed to come to the right conclusion, and then the 
process of being able to put something out for notice and 
comment just meant we couldn't have gotten it done between 
September and December of last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    So it was my decision as Chairman to say: We will get this 
done in 2018. The process has begun of briefing the two 
Commissioners on the data sets which we now have through 2017, 
and it is good, it is robust data. So I expect to get this done 
in a matter of months.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Harris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Harris"> And does this entity-netted notional value,
will that enter into it? I mean, it kind of makes sense that 
that is the way you should gauge what the risk is of what you 
are regulating.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> So this is an issue that many in the
marketplace feel has gone on for too long. And I think if we 
were to use this new metric--which, by the way, is new, and I 
do think it requires a degree of peer review and analysis--I 
think we would struggle to get this done this year. So I think 
the marketplace has a legitimate expectation that we get it 
done. I think the entity-netted notionals will take some time 
to work its way through the firmament. But there are now a 
number of academics who are looking at it and testing it, and I 
would hope that a year from now, in a number of other areas 
where we have to do risk assessment, it might become the basis 
for that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Harris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Harris"> And with regards to the swap dealer de minimis,
is it your feeling that it is a good idea to keep it near the 
$8 billion level?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Well, I would like to see if we can get to a
unanimous decision. I would like to see if we can do that. So I 
would like to hear from my two fellow Commissioners. We will 
get it done one way or the other. And if we have to get it done 
2 to 1, we will get it done, but I would love to get it done on 
a 3-0 vote.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Harris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Harris"> Sure. OK. The second issue is something that
regards--something not from under your watch, but with regards 
to some of the leases that were issued in the Antideficiency 
Act. I know there was a letter I guess sent from the GAO to the 
chairman of the committee yesterday--this week--about this 
question of whether or not the CFTC has entered into leases 
that, because of various provisions that don't limit government 
liability, that they would appear to be in violation of the 
Antideficiency Act and may require statutory changes or other 
things to bring the Commission into compliance. If you would 
comment on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">So we received that letter about 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, and I had a brief word with our general 
counsel. I haven't had a chance to read the letter itself. I 
understand it does open concerns about open liabilities. As you 
know, these leases go back to the 1990s and, in some cases, the 
early 2000s. It does look like errors were made. I don't want 
to shirk responsibility. We will correct what needs to be 
corrected. If there are deficiencies to be reported, we will 
report the deficiencies, and we will bring ourselves whole in 
this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    There have been other issues raised over the last few 
years, and in each case, we have done the right thing, reported 
the deficiencies, and recently received a clean audit opinion. 
So we will take the right steps. I think the bigger issue is 
that we are an agency that, years ago, leased too much space, 
and that is still something we are fighting with. And as the 
chairman noted, we have been able to successfully offload some 
of our space in the Kansas City office. We are making a 
significant reduction. We are looking to do the same thing in 
New York. We have a very active effort to do that. We don't 
have as much of a problem in Chicago and in Washington. We will 
look to see what we can do, but I take this very seriously. As 
a former businessman, that empty space is not a good use of 
taxpayer money. So we will try to find a way to continue on the 
success we had in Kansas City and do more with it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Harris</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Harris">Well, thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Harris">    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> I recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr.
Pocan.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pocan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Pocan">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Pocan">Thank you for being here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Pocan">If I can follow up on something that the subcommittee 
chairman asked around derivatives. So, in the budget, you know, 
this is an added responsibility; you went through an extensive 
amount of work that you are doing in this area and what areas 
you are not in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Pocan">    With the budget that you have, is that sufficient to 
continue to do all this work in this new area? And, you know, 
what is going to get put aside if not?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Thank you very much. I mean, it is a big
job. The biggest challenge--so great credit to my predecessors; 
they got the bulk of the Dodd-Frank swaps reforms done at the 
CFTC. We are not only the leading agency in the United States 
in terms of completing the workload, but we are the leader 
around the world. So we take great pride in that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">But I often think about what is ahead. When Dodd-Frank was 
passed, it didn't address cyber. It didn't address algorithm 
trading. A lot of the issues we are facing now are what is 
coming at us. A lot of what we are trying to do in this budget 
is prepare ourselves for this next phase of market evolution, 
what I call the digitization of markets. Markets are recently 
being driven by computer training and, increasingly, computers 
that are using artificial and machine learning to learn from 
other activities in the market and then adjust their trading 
screens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">So we have a lot to learn from that, which is why we 
started our LabCFTC initiative. We have got great people at the 
agency, but some people who have been tracking markets for the 
last 30, 40 years, not necessarily--despite all that experience 
are not necessarily on the cutting edge of where technology is 
going. And, you know, when it comes to technologists, we are 
competing with some of the biggest, most sophisticated 
companies in Silicon Valley and others to get that expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    And so LabCFTC gives us a way to learn and then train 
ourselves internally. So do I think the budget is the right 
number? I have worked this budget very, very hard. I think it 
is a responsible budget number. I think it gives us the 
resources we need. We may have to talk in the future, but I 
think this is the right budget for now and for the mission we 
have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pocan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Pocan"> Thank you. And you brought me right to the
second question that I had, which is--and I said this last 
year, too--you have established a very good relationship with 
your employees. They speak very highly of the relationship they 
have built with you. The question is, you know, a lot of the 
folks are being rated, so to speak, by other financial 
agencies, by private firms. Do you feel that you have been able 
to make some progress, the question we asked was, you know, to 
keep those people in this very competitive area? How is that 
working from a year ago when I asked the question, and do you 
need additional resources in this area?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">So, with the flat funding we have had for 3
or 4 years, it almost imposes something of a hiring freeze. You 
can't backfill. And the problem with that is you can't control 
attrition. You can't say, well, we have too many people in this 
unit; maybe that unit will suffer more attrition than another. 
You have no control. Often, sometimes, it is the very best 
people who are recruited away by either competing government 
agencies or in the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Some of our best technologists we have lost recently to 
private sector concerns because of the experience they have 
gotten at the CFTC. So that is a real challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">You know, again, I spent 30 years in the private sector and 
14 in a public company working with personnel, and so it is a 
big part of my management style to meet frequently. I do 
frequent townhalls. I have one coming up in just two weeks with 
the agencywide staff. I talk a lot about goals. I try to be 
very transparent with personnel at the agency as to what our 
mission is, and we spend a lot of time talking about mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    I will just leave you with one thing. The message I give 
the staff is the message that the coach of the New England 
Patriots gives to them. And that is every person to their job. 
I say: If every person does their job to the level of 
excellence, the whole agency will take an approach of 
excellence. And not withstanding their loss in the Super Bowl, 
they still bring excellence to the game, and that is what we 
try to do as well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pocan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Pocan"> And how about specifically to the incentive
question for some of these folks, because if they are being 
rated for more money, are you able, with the budget you have, 
to be able to do what you need to do to keep the staff?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">We just reached--and I am very proud of
this--we just reached a 3-year pay package with our union, 
first time ever. In fact, when I arrived at the agency, we were 
in a dispute with the union. We have gone from dispute to a 
very successful 3-year arrangement, and it has in it an up to 3 
percent performance-based, merit-based reward for employee 
performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    So we are trying to move more into a reward performance 
basis at the agency. And I must say, the union brought the same 
goodwill back to the bargaining table that we brought, and I 
think that is a recipe for good progress in the future.

    <speaker>Mr. Pocan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Pocan">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Pocan">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> Mr. Yoder.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoder</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Yoder">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Yoder">And, Chairman, good to have you here today. I want to sort 
of associate my comments a little bit with the comments of the 
ranking member regarding user fees. And you and I have had a 
conversation about this as well and the concern being that that 
ultimately passes down to farmers and producers in our States 
that are already struggling under low commodity prices and, as 
you correctly stated, would tax efforts from them to protect 
their risk and to hedge and might push them into taxpayer-
funded options. So I appreciate your comments on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Yoder">And I think this committee and this Congress has been 
pretty clear over the years that it doesn't support those user 
fees, and of course, the good things you are trying to do in 
your budget, we will try hard to find general fund dollars to 
spend as opposed to taxing the markets and ultimately our 
producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Yoder">I want to talk to you a little bit about the plans that the 
Fed has to replace CEM with SA-CCR. And, as we know, these are 
methodologies for calculating how much capital a bank has to 
hold to comply with the SLR rule, or supplemental leverage 
ratio, in relation to a cleared option. CEM is a very old risk 
insensitive method while SA-CCR is accepted generally to better 
gauge risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Yoder">It is my understanding that the Fed intends to move in this 
direction, but is likely to do via rulemaking, which interested 
parties suggest could take up to 3 years. Meanwhile, markets 
are operating in an artificially constrained state because they 
are under these old rules. And some say this was evident in the 
February market behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Yoder">    So I guess my question for you is, given the increased 
volatility we have seen in markets this year, I am interested 
in your view of whether this may be an indication that swifter 
action is needed than the potential 2- to 3-year rulemaking 
process.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Thank you for that, and I think that is a
very perceptive insight. In fact, we do have some anecdotal 
information that has come to the agency that, during the 5th 
and 6th of February, during that market swoon, suggests we may 
have seen the impact of the current form of the supplementary 
leverage ratio impacting the ability of larger market makers to 
take on positions. And, therefore, the market movement may have 
been exacerbated because of the current form of the 
supplementary leverage ratio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">And let me just talk about that for a minute. I find myself 
in kind of an odd position. I am a Republican who supported the 
provision in title VII that says, we want to move bilateral 
swaps into central clearing, only to find that some of my 
fellow regulators in the system have a supplementary leverage 
ratio approach that actually deters moving more products into 
clearing. These are at issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">I think that we made a policy choice in title VII that we 
want to see more central clearing of derivatives, and yet in 
its current form, the supplementary leverage ratio, which is 
not mandated specifically in title VII, has this opposite or 
this deterring impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    So we have got some work to do here. I have been very 
candid in my views with folks at the Fed, including a new 
Chairman, Powell, and look forward to actually sitting down 
with Randall Quarles soon to talk a little bit about this as 
well. So I think we can get it right, but we don't have it 
right currently.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoder</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Yoder"> Well, I think the Fed is heading in that
direction. My concern is that it can take a while for the 
wheels of the Fed to turn, and a rulemaking process could take 
2 to 3 years. Are you concerned about the length of time it 
could take to fix this because we continue to have this 
challenge and this arcane requirement that affects, you know, 
the options markets at the same time?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> I must say: I spent 30 years in the private
sector; the length of time things take here in Washington is 
just sometimes astounding.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoder</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Yoder">You get it, and I appreciate your work in that
regard. I also want to ask you a little bit about CFTC's 
decision last year to approve a variable storage rate on Kansas 
City Hard Red Winter wheat. As you know, I am from Kansas. We 
are the biggest wheat-producing State in the country, and 
America is the biggest wheat-producing country in the world. So 
wheat is a critical part of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Yoder">    And this was a particularly important decision given the 
significant disparity between the wheat farmers' local cash 
price and futures price. Could you provide the committee with 
an update about the current market situation and your views 
about how VSR could fully work once implemented and describe 
the CFTC's role in implementing VSR?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Thank you for that. I think sometimes people
look at us as regulators and think, as rules evolve or change, 
we then walk away and move on to something else and don't 
review the evolution. But that is not the case. As our 
exchanges bring forward rule changes, we are actively engaged 
both in advance, but then thereafter to monitor how those rule 
changes are working in the marketplace. And I think it is a 
critically important part of what we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    We don't want markets that are static. We want markets that 
evolve as market participation evolves, but we also need to 
stay very close to it to see how those evolutions impact. So, 
in the case of the variable storage rate, we have a team that 
watches this very carefully and are watching it now to see if 
the evolution is meeting the needs of our core users but also 
those who also provide liquidity to them as well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Yoder</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Yoder"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> Ms. Pingree.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Pingree</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. Pingree">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you
for being in front of us today and for all the topics we have 
already considered. I have got just a couple of questions for 
you. You have been very articulate in discussing why the budget 
number that you have gotten comfortable with is important, and 
I think people have asked you a lot of questions, but I just 
want to give you one more chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. Pingree">    And I was thinking particularly of some of the things you 
had mentioned around cybersecurity, surveillance enforcement. 
So, if you don't get the number you want, how will it impact 
some of those really critical things?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">It is very challenging. So let me just give
you a couple of figures. So I am going to give you four Federal 
agencies and tell you what their cyber--I will give you three, 
and then I will tell you what the CFTC proposal is and what 
their cyber spending is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">So the SEC, their budget for cyber is $60 million. The 
FDIC, it is about $110 million. And the Treasury, it is about 
$500 million. Our budget request is $7 million. Now, I think 
that is still the right number. So, in the most recent FISMA 
cybersecurity risk assessment, the CFTC had the highest ranking 
of any of those agencies, and yet the smallest budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    So I am proud of what we are doing, and I think this is 
where I bring some of my business management experience. I can 
assure this committee: Every dollar we are asking for we will 
spend, and it is my intention to be the best cost-effective 
dollar spender. So I think we are the best at our 
cybersecurity, and yet we have the lowest budget, and I am very 
proud of that. But we need that $7 million. We don't need 6.5; 
we need the 7. And I say that goes to our budget as a whole. In 
every case, we have tried to make it as tight as possible, but 
knowing that every dollar is extremely well-devoted.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Pingree</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Ms. Pingree">Thank you for being so articulate and exacting
about that. I think it does help, when sometimes these numbers 
become very arbitrary and the cuts just become a slash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Ms. Pingree">    One of the things--your testimony talks a little bit about 
the communication you have had with foreign counterparts 
through bilateral discussions in the IOSC. Can you just tell me 
a little bit more about your engagement with European 
counterparts on cooperating on some of these new challenges in 
a global--and maybe the Asian side as well?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Thank you. So I take the international
engagement of the agency very, very seriously. Within weeks of 
becoming Acting Chairman, I flew to Brussels and met with our 
counterparts there. I met with them in London and Asia as well. 
I was just in Asia in the autumn. These global relationships 
are very important. And I believe in the initiative that was 
begun in 2009 in Pittsburgh of the G20 to reform the global 
derivative markets and support the CFTC's efforts, and as I 
mentioned, we have been a leader in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">And as other countries come online, working out 
harmonization between us has been a very big part of the 
process. One of the big accomplishments of my predecessor, 
Chairman Massad, was, in 2016, to negotiate an equivalence 
determination for clearinghouse supervision between the United 
States and Europe. And since that time, in 2017, under my 
leadership, we were able to negotiate two more equivalence 
determinations for margin on uncleared swaps, as well as on 
trading platforms. So, again, the CFTC has been a leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">I am concerned, however, that, in the wake of Brexit, the 
European Parliament is taking up some new legislation, and it 
is unclear in that legislation what the impact would be on the 
2016 agreement that we negotiated less than 2 years ago, I 
think it was in May, less than 2 years ago with Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    So I was in front of the European Parliament 2 weeks ago. I 
had the pleasure of testifying in front of them as I am 
testifying before you today. And I made very clear that having 
negotiated a deal, we expect that deal to stand, and we expect 
the parties to that deal to stand behind that deal.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Pingree</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Ms. Pingree"> Are there big challenges in sort of a
harmonizing?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Again, there are benefits, but there are
also challenges in being a leader. And because we are out in 
front, as we see other nations come online, we need to look at 
those regulations very carefully and find out where the gaps 
are between what we are doing and where the overlap is. So I 
would say that there are issues all around but nothing I would 
bring to this committee's attention at this point, other than 
saying it is a constant challenge. We have got a very good 
group in our international affairs group at the CFTC. They are 
on the road constantly. They are reading briefing papers, 
constantly coming into my office, keeping us abreast of the 
issues, but it is a big challenge.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Pingree</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Ms. Pingree">Well, thank you for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Ms. Pingree">    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> Mr. Valadao.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Valadao</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Valadao">Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for being here,
and I appreciate you answering a few of the questions I was 
concerned with as well from my fellow members up here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Valadao">But I do want to touch a little more on one issue. So, Mr. 
Chairman, in 2017, a report by the CFTC's inspector general 
criticized the CFTC's outdated method in collecting data on 
derivatives markets activity and called some of the data 
essentially unusable. Other reports have raised concerns that 
the CFTC's technology is outdated and unable to keep pace with 
that of the derivatives markets participants overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Valadao">    While I understand the CFTC has been taking a preliminary 
look at new ledger technology, such as blockchain, that it 
hopes will help better analyze data. Specifically, could you 
please tell us the steps you have taken in the last 6 months 
towards modernizing the CFTC's IT system? And how would you 
currently rate today's system as to whether you are behind, 
ahead of, or just keeping pace with IT systems among market 
participants that you regulate?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Thank you. That is a critically important
question. You know, one the core mandates of title VII to come 
out of the financial crisis was greater regulatory transparency 
into market positions of large market participants. And a big 
initiative was to collect data, create swap data repositories, 
and make that data available both to us as regulators and to 
the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">I support that core reform and that initiative. Since that 
time, however--and I read very carefully that inspector 
general's report and took a lot away from it. Again, not to 
shirk responsibility, the time period covered was that of the 
prior Commission. But what I read in that report and what I 
have taken away from that report is really a failure of project 
management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Again, from my experience in the private sector, project 
management is the difference between success and failure in any 
large project, and this is an enormous project. So I have 
changed both the leadership of the project, their goals, and 
their deliverables. And as a result, in the second half of 
2017, the agency issued, under my direction, a road map to this 
data project. We actually said--and my dad used to say to me: 
If you don't know where you are going, you will never get 
there. We said where we are going, and we said when we want to 
get there. And we laid it out in a series of deliverables over 
the course of 2018. And by the end of 2019, we intend to 
complete this project of data transparency into our swaps 
marketplace. Now, that may sound like a long time, but, 
unfortunately, progress hadn't been made earlier and so we need 
to take where we are today and go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">And I thank the OIG for their work because I think it 
helped our thinking on this. I think we now have the right 
people in place. We have the right goals in place. We have the 
right deliverables. We are actively engaged in this, not just 
domestically, but internationally as well. We are chairing some 
of the key groups at CPMI-IOSCO, which is the International 
Association of Securities Regulators, and elsewhere in putting 
together the global standards that need to be used because 
these are not domestic markets anymore, they are global 
markets. And it is only--it will only do us so good if we have 
the correct data for our domestic trades but don't have it on a 
global basis. So we need to reach the global standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    And the last thing I would say is that, built into our 
budget is allocation for upgrading a number of key systems. The 
hardware that is necessary to deliver on this project as well. 
So full funding for our budget also means that we will meet the 
deliverables of that road map. If we are not able to get there, 
then we will have to see how we triage other resources to be 
able to stay on target for that timetable.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Valadao</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Valadao"> So, on the second part of that question, which
is, how do you rate the current system? Give us some examples. 
Tell me a little bit about how the current system is working in 
comparison to what is going on around the world and even some 
of the participants in the marketplace that you regulate?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Well, first of all, I don't want to get too
critical because we still do absorb 60 million records a day. I 
mean, we take in an enormous amount of data, equal to perhaps 
any other financial regulator and probably greater than most 
around the world. So we successfully analyze--we are a data 
analysis agency. We do a lot with what we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    However, the next frontier is to do the kind of thing that 
eBay and Google and others do with enormous amounts of data, 
and they automate the data analysis. You know, our data 
analysis is still partially manual, partially automated. You 
know, where we want to go in the future would be to bring a 
much higher level of automation. That may be a 2020-2021 
project. We still have to complete what we have started. But, 
that is on the horizon for not just the CFTC but for financial 
regulators everywhere, to be able to analyze the data the way, 
big Silicon Valley companies analyze commercial shopping data 
and all that. They do amazing things with data analysis. We are 
not there yet, but that has got to be the path forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Valadao</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Valadao">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Valadao">    Thank you, Chairman. My time has expired.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> Ms. DeLauro.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Nice to see
you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much. I think we all know how 
catastrophic the impact of years and years of deregulation was. 
I mean, it culminated in the 2008 crash. Dodd-Frank, which I 
was proud to support, has put us on the path to reducing that 
threat of the too-big-to-fail firms. It protects consumers and 
investors so that they are not swindled, they are not ripped 
off, and focusing on supporting an economy that works for all 
Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">And I will just say, took the most dangerous and most 
unreasonable risks in the financial system, they have been 
greatly reduced. And a financial crash, and I think you 
probably would agree, is much less likely due to Dodd-Frank 
rules and with everything that was encompassed there. And like 
with most laws, it is not perfect, but an imperfect law is 
better than no law at all. I think you would agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">I am, frankly, troubled by the efforts that are supported 
by both Democrats and Republicans that would scale back some of 
the regulations that have been put in place, and that is to 
really unravel Dodd-Frank in many respects. I am equally 
concerned with what looks like the Commission's desire to work 
on new, bright, shiny object cryptocurrency when there is so 
much work to be done in the financial markets that impact so 
many more Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">For example, we know that just 1,000 individuals own 40 
percent of all bitcoin. Bitcoin's own website published a 
survey of 5,761 adults on January 24 of this year, and it 
showed 60 percent of Americans had heard of bitcoin, and only 5 
percent owned any bitcoin. In past year, CFTC has successfully 
managed to protect consumers, imposing billions of dollars of 
sanctions on bad actors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">    So why should the committee support the diversion of 
resources to regulate a new financial world when there is so 
much that still needs to be done in looking at what is going on 
with unraveling the regulations in Dodd-Frank? Why shouldn't we 
continue to stay the course, focus our energies on what has 
been successful. The regulations were put into place to prevent 
another crisis. Why are we going to--how are we going to 
continue to maintain the protection of the majority of 
Americans if we are going to divert our time, attention, and 
resources to some of these other areas?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Thank you for the question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">So it was my predecessor who looked at our law, the 
Commodity Exchange Act, and reached the conclusion that 
cryptocurrency, at least in the form of bitcoin, meets the 
definition of commodities under our act and began the process 
there for doing what we are legally obligated to do, which is 
enforcing our rules against fraud and manipulation. And so the 
process of enforcing laws against fraud and manipulation in 
cryptocurrencies began by Chairman Massad, and I have continued 
that process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    We don't have statutory authority to ban bitcoin. It is not 
within our authority to do that. It would require an act of 
Congress.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> It is not a point of banning it, but we are--
when I say 5 percent own bitcoin. This is a very small piece of 
the overall picture here. Again, you have a limited budget, and 
believe me, I have chaired this subcommittee and increased 
funding for the CFTC. But a limited--and why are we then moving 
our limited resources to an area where--I understand you want 
to do some looking, but it has a very just small piece of the--
--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> I would be concerned though because, as you
say, there are scammers out there that are taking advantage of 
people's interest in these cryptocurrencies, especially young 
people. And for us to say, ``You know what, we can't spend the 
resources to bring enforcement actions against fraud and 
manipulation,'' would in a sense leave those people vulnerable. 
So I think we have a duty, if it fits within the definition of 
our statute, have a duty to take enforcement action.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">I would just finish with this because my time
is almost up. I understand that, and I think we ought to, you 
know, look at the new areas and rooting out fraud and all those 
pieces. But as I started my commentary, I am very, very 
troubled by how in fact--and as I say, this is both Democrats 
and Republicans--are unraveling Dodd-Frank. It was put into 
place for prevention purposes given the enormity of the crash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">Quite frankly, I sat in the room with Secretary Paulson and 
Ben Bernanke when they told our leadership that--this was a 
Friday--that, by Monday, we were going off a financial cliff if 
we didn't do something. And I am--I don't come out of your 
world or their world, but it was troubling. So we put these 
preventions in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">This is like saying to me, in some regards, where I think 
you ought to pay attention--and you are, don't misunderstand 
me, you are--and you need to pay focused attention on what is 
going to happen. You know, after--we put protections in place 
after Hurricane Katrina, okay. Now since we haven't had a 
hurricane of that scale, now we are going to dismantle the 
protections. That is essentially what is being done in Dodd-
Frank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">And it is my view that that is something that you need to 
pay very, very close attention to and what the risks are going 
to be to the majority of Americans if some of these things 
continue to be unraveled and there is no protection as we 
started to--as we tried to put in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> Mr. Young.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Young">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome. Nice to see
you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Young">I want to talk about RINs. You know what those are: 
renewable identification numbers. So the point of the RFS, as 
you know, was to blend more biofuels. When it was adopted the 
refiners themselves asked Congress to include an alternative 
compliance method comprised of tradeable credits so refiners 
would have more flexibility. So RINs are free. You get one when 
you blend a gallon of biofuel. If you choose not to blend, 
which some refiners do, then you have to buy a RIN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Young">I want to talk about RIN transparency. In March of 2016, 
the CFTC did an MOU with the EPA related to the RIN markets. So 
the purpose of the MOU was to, in part, to permit sharing of 
business information on the RIN market so that CFTC could 
advise EPA on, quote, techniques that could be employed to 
minimize fraud, market abuses, or other violations, and to 
conduct appropriate oversight in RIN and renewable fuel 
markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Young">    What kind of advice have you given EPA? What have you 
learned?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Thank you for the question. So we entered
into that MOU and the project that commenced following it was 
that the EPA provided the CFTC with trading data in the cash 
markets. Let me actually just draw a jurisdictional picture for 
you. The EPA has jurisdiction over the physical RINs market. As 
you know, CFTC has jurisdiction over the RINs derivative 
markets, RINs futures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">And just by way of background, there is virtually no 
trading in RINs futures. I mean, less than a dozen. So, arising 
from the MOU, my predecessor, Tim Massad, reached an agreement 
with the EPA that they provide us with their trading data in 
that underlying cash market, and we would review it using our 
tools to look for fraud and manipulation if we saw it in that 
market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    Unfortunately, as anybody who has worked in data knows, the 
ability to draw conclusions depends on the quality of the data. 
We were able to go back to the EPA, and say: We do not see 
signs of fraud and manipulation in this market. But then, 
again, the data is not terribly good. And we gave them some 
advice, one regulator to another, as to perhaps steps they 
could take to improve the quality of the data.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Young"> So is the data not good because it is just not
transparent, you are not getting the information? Tell me why 
the data is not good.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Again, it is their process of collecting the
data. It is not our process, but----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Young"> How would you change that process to get better
data?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">I would have to go back to our folks that
did that analysis and met with the EPA, but my understanding is 
they gave them advice about the very nature of how it is 
collected, what is collected, what are the time series of what 
is collected, the thoroughness. And it was--it had issues from 
soup to nuts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    Now, what I will share with you, Congressman, is recently I 
had a chance to sit down with Ag Secretary Perdue, and he 
brought up this very issue and his concern that we try to find 
a path forward. And I have asked our chief economist to sit 
down with his chief economist and maybe folks from EPA as well 
to pick up this conversation and to see what can be done going 
forward. So there is a dialogue that has begun. I don't know 
what their meeting schedule is to see what can be--when I 
report to you that process, it was a process that was done 
under my predecessor so the information I am giving you is a 
little bit secondhand, but it is my understanding as I have 
described it to you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Young">Well, I think Congress should be kept abreast of
this. I would love to work with you and, you know, working with 
the stakeholders as well within the industry in making sure 
that we all have a complete understanding of what is happening, 
why it is happening, the process, and if there is a need for 
better transparency and accountability along the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Young">    And I just have a few seconds left so I am just going to 
yield back, and I will wait for the next round, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Thank you. I would be happy to come in and
visit with you once that meeting has taken place amongst the 
economists and keep you abreast of the discussions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Young"> I look forward to that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Thank you, Mr. Young.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Mr. Chairman, I am sure you are aware of our fiscal year 
2018 bill carries a provision that would amend the Commodity 
Exchange Act to require a lower level of margin or capital, 
known as variation margin, in transactions of a swap between 
one party and its affiliate with whom it has some type of 
shared ownership interest. This is in contrast to the current 
requirement for a higher amount of capital, known as initial 
margin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">    Additionally, the bill carries a provision that will 
require a more stringent analysis of the cost benefits to CFTC 
actions. The question would be, could you explain why the 
initial margin requirements were put in place by prudential 
regulators but were not initially required by your agency, 
which specializes in regulating swaps and has the knowledge and 
expertise on these matters?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> I will add to that that not only did we not
follow that approach, but the rest of the world didn't follow 
that approach of our prudentials. So our prudentials on this 
are a bit of an outlier in global markets. As an agency that 
oversees markets that are global, we understand the 
implications of a margin requirement that really doesn't 
address that the systemic risk is the counterparty to 
counterparty not internally within an organization. And the 
reason we didn't follow the prudentials approach is we believe 
that it actually makes it more difficult for American users of 
these products, end users, whether they be manufacturers or 
other large businesses to--it is disadvantageous for them to 
use an American financial service firm to transact in global 
markets because the American firms are the ones paying that 
initial internal margin. And it gives an advantage to foreign 
financial service firms. And what we find unhelpful about this 
approach is essentially it puts our firms in a competitive 
disadvantage in operating in global markets. And it causes 
American end users to choose foreign financial service firms 
over American financial service firms in engaging in foreign 
markets. So that is the reason we took the approach we did. We 
think it is anticompetitive for American business. And we don't 
think it really enhances systemic stability because that is 
enhanced simply by the margin being posted when one distinct 
firm trades with another distinct firm.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> What was the position of your predecessors on
this issue? And where do you see your policies differ on the 
issue?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> My position on this is completely consistent
with Chairman Massad's position. We came to a similar 
conclusion when we were together at the Commission. He voiced 
it on behalf of the Commission as Chairman. I know he voiced 
that position with the prudentials at the time. And I continue 
to believe Chairman Massad got that right, and I think we have 
got it right at the Commission.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> In regard to the cost-benefit analysis
requirement, what is your opinion of placing a mandate on the 
agency?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> So I am a big believer on cost-benefit, and
not to be used in the event of a lawsuit. It is just to get the 
rule right in the first place. I think that if you do proper 
economic analysis, you come up with a better rule and a rule 
that serves the passage of time. And so I believe in it. Now, 
we don't have as robust a standard of cost-benefit analysis at 
the CFTC as does say a comparable agency like the SEC. So there 
has been a number of conversations over the years about 
enhancing the CFTC standard. And I think that there is a lot of 
value in some of those considerations. But at the end of day, I 
think good cost-benefit analysis is simply a matter of good 
government.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> The House passed both of these provisions in
both the CFTC authorization and the ag approps bill. Are you 
aware of opposition either on the Hill or in the administration 
that would prevent enactment of these provisions----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> I am not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> You mentioned this briefly, you referred to
it, but let me just go a little deeper into labor and union 
negotiations. During our hearing last year, we discussed the 
situation around your labor union negotiations and we included 
in our bill a provision that will allow you to adjust the pay 
and benefits to your employees should furloughs or reductions 
in force occur as a result of these negotiations. This was done 
because there were reports that CFTC would have to lay off 
employees if they did not receive its budget request and a 
Federal Service Impasse Panel imposed excessive financial 
burdens on your agency. I also stated at the time that it would 
be difficult to give your agency more funding unless the 
situation resolved because the money would not be used to 
invest in high priority resources for overseeing the markets 
the Commission continues to claim, of course, it needs. Can you 
give us a little bit of an update on the labor negotiations for 
the current fiscal year and even future years?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> The labor negotiations proceed in, I think,
a satisfactory pace. The very first phone call I made upon 
being sworn in as Acting Chairman was to the head of union and 
to say that I look forward to good relationships with them. At 
that time, we were in a bad place vis--vis us and the union. We 
were in dispute mediation. We have resolved those issues, and 
we are--as I mentioned earlier, we achieved a 3-year pay 
package with the union. We have other items to resolve before 
we can get to a similar 3-year collective bargaining agreement, 
but we are making good progress on that. And I believe that the 
good will continues on both sides. It certainly will continue 
on management's side. With the continued good will, I think, 
and honesty--that we have brought to the table and that they 
have as well, I think we can continue to make progress.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> Thank you. I think my time is up.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Bishop">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Bishop">Thank you very much. Let me return to another
issue. The Futures Industry Association wrote you last December 
to express concern about the process by which several CFTC-
regulated exchanges and clearinghouses self-certified certain 
futures and options contracts on cryptocurrencies. The letter 
said, quote: ``Under law, exchanges may self-certify a product 
for trading by the close of business one day and then list the 
product for trading the next day. This process does not require 
CFTC approval or input and allows little or no time for public 
review. While suited for standardized products, this process 
does not distinguish for a products risk profile or unique 
nature. We believe that this expedited self-certification 
process for these novel products does not align with the 
potential risks that underlie their trading and should be 
reviewed.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    I do understand that your staff had extensive discussions 
with these entities prior to the announcement, but, frankly, it 
sounds like the agency had to ask for changes, not insist on 
them. Given the volatile nature of the bitcoin market, this is 
a bit troubling, no pun intended. Would you discuss this?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Yeah. So the self-certification process goes
back almost two decades at the agency, it has been long-
standing. And I think that, until recently, it hasn't been 
controversial. Over 12,000 products have been self-certified 
over that period of time. And to my knowledge, it hasn't been 
the subject of a great deal of controversy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Under those provisions, the exchanges did approach the CFTC 
over the course of the second half of last year. And we did 
require them to make a number of enhancements that we refer to 
as our heightened review process for cryptocurrencies. You are 
absolutely right; it was on a voluntary basis. I have asked the 
staff to go back and consider whether that can be put into 
staff guidance. And even though the process doesn't provide for 
public hearings, Commissioner Behnam held, as part of our 
Market Risk Advisory Committee, held I think a very well-
attended, very well-considered, very well-thought-through 
public hearing on the self-certification process. A number of 
ideas came out of that. And I am open to discussing with my 
fellow Commissioners whether there should be some adjustments 
to the self-certification process, and we will hear ideas 
amongst the Commissioners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    Having said that, I do want to make it clear that the self-
certification process is a longstanding feature of the agency. 
I think we were able to utilize it to get some quite 
unprecedented concessions from the two bitcoin futures 
providers, and we will require that on a going-forward basis 
for any future self-certifications that we might see for 
bitcoin or otherwise.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Bishop">It seems like the timeframe is so short in that
particular instance that it raised concerns. So I hope that you 
will look at that and perhaps get back to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Bishop">    On cybersecurity, obviously, that is a constant concern for 
both Federal agencies and the industry. And I believe you said 
last month that you don't have the authority to impose 
cybersecurity regulations on the cryptocurrency industry where 
hacks have occurred with relative frequency. Can you give us 
the state of cybersecurity at CFTC itself and at the companies 
that you oversee, including the cryptocurrency world?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Thank you for that. I am actually glad you
drew a distinction between the CFTC itself and the companies we 
oversee. As I mentioned before, the CFTC recently had its 
audit, its annual audit, as do all Federal agencies, and we 
ranked ahead of many of our fellow agencies. I am very pleased 
with the results there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> Is that a good thing?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">Well, you know, let's hope it is. You know,
when it comes to cyber, you can never say it will never happen 
to you. You have to assume it will happen at some point. And 
so--which is why I put in a number of reforms since I have 
become chairman. I meet monthly with our head of cyber. He 
reviews all of the cyber activities every month. We receive 
almost 9,000 attacks--attempts a month. So the attacks are 
relentless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo">    We are also looking at human error. So we are upping our 
game in terms of doing internal testing of what is called 
phishing exercises. I feel we are doing a lot of good things at 
the CFTC. I wish I had as good of a feeling--and I will be very 
candid with you--of our ability to monitor what is going on in 
the ecosystem in the markets we oversee. Right now, we should 
have four cybersecurity examiners for the players in our 
market. Through attrition, we are down to one. And in our 
budget is the resources to fill those gaps, but we desperately 
need to do that because I would much rather that our examiner 
goes into an exchange or to a clearinghouse and say, ``There is 
a gap in your cyber defenses,'' and they fix it. I would much 
rather that than to get a phone call the next day or some other 
time saying that they have been hacked and now we have got some 
problems in the marketplace. So a pound of prevention is 
worth--whatever it is. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound 
of cure. I would like to make sure we have got that ounce and 
fill those three missing----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bishop</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Bishop"> Are you going to be able to find the resources
to do that not including that $31.5 million?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> I said in the opening: Give us the tools, we
will do the job. Give us the tools, we will do the job. We will 
fill them. I am a persuasive recruiter.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> Mr. Young.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Young">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Young">    Mr. Chairman, speed, technology, algorithms, artificial 
intelligence. I have got concerns based on the concerns of 
farmers. The producers back home ask about the ability of the 
CFTC to effectively provide oversight for our farmers, 
producers, with all this happening, particularly the balance 
between fundamental market users versus the algorithmic trader. 
Do we have balance? How do you get it? We need it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> That is a great question. When I meet with
farmers and travel around the country, the question that seems 
to be the common question is, what is going on in these 
markets? When I go in the market, am I getting run over by a 
speeding train of algorithmic traders? What is the role they 
play in the market? What is the balance between them and us, 
the natural hedgers? It is not an easy question to answer. 
There are a lot of anecdotal stories, but that doesn't prove 
anything. And this is why we are seeking to really redouble our 
economists unit. We want answers to these questions, and we 
want good, solid data-driven answers, not answers that are 
driven by a story or an experience in the marketplace. You 
know, healthy markets are like environments in the natural 
world, the healthiest ones, the most durable ones are the ones 
that have the most biodiversity, and the same thing is true 
about economic markets. You couldn't have a market if you just 
had naturals because everybody would be long, there would be 
nobody to go short. You need the balance. But balance is the 
operative word. What is the right balance? And our markets are 
changing so dramatically, so what is a responsible agency to 
do? It is to first understand these changes and then decide 
what are the right policy responses. The one thing I won't do 
is, based on some anecdote, go in and start setting 
restrictions on who can be in the market and who can't, because 
they may be the very valuable liquidity providers the market 
needs. What we need to do is really understand the role of 
these algorithmic trades and the proprietary traders that are 
not natural--they are not naturally long. They are just taking 
the other side of a trade all day long; they can be long or 
short. And so we need to understand that dynamic, which is why 
we are asking for additional resources for the Office of the 
Chief Economist.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Young"> As you the witness the rise of algorithmic
trading, have you seen a rise in volatility? Can you measure 
that somewhere? Can you pinpoint it? Is it there? Is it----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> It is not an exact correlation.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Young"> OK. It is not a correlation. How do you manage
volatility? Should you?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Well, that--in many ways, that is what these
products do, the more volatile the market--in fact, somebody 
mentioned bitcoin. In fact, what is interesting is the impact 
that the bitcoin futures has had on the underlying price. The 
day the bitcoin futures launched on CME was the high watermark 
of the bitcoin price. And since then, it seems to be 
stabilizing around 10,000. So the launch of the future--a 
healthy futures market often brings a stability to underlying 
markets.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Young"> Can you measure during a trading day which are--
how many are algorithmic trading from computers, and how many 
are the true market makers? Is it 10 to 1? Is it 50-50?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Again, it is different in virtually every
marketplace. Some markets' financials tend to be more dominated 
than the commodity and natural and softs markets. But yet the 
markets we live in today are majority automated and 
increasingly algorithmic. I mean, the day of the manual trading 
is passing with the day of the trading floor. And we have to 
accept that markets are becoming digital in the same way the 
rest of our world is becoming digital, and they are becoming 
increasingly automated and increasingly algorithmic. That is 
the world we heading toward, and that is why, as an agency, we 
need to be up to that challenge. We need to be as digital as 
these markets.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Young">It reminds me of a line from a Pink Floyd song:
Welcome to the Machine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Young">    I yield.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Aderholt"> Ms. DeLauro.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">Chairman Giancarlo, you convened a meeting of the CFTC on 
February 28. It was with the SEC Chairman Clayton, SEC 
Commissioner Peirce, CFTC Commissioner Quintenz, and the staff 
from both the CFTC and the SEC. This is a tweet from your 
February 27 gathering at 9:18 p.m., and it reads: Earlier 
today, at CFTC, staff at CFTC, Quintenz, and I hosted Chairman 
Clayton and SEC colleagues to discuss better harmonizing Dodd-
Frank regs and rules. We are off to a great start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">This was not a public meeting, but one that was behind 
closed doors and one among only Republican members of both 
Commissions as I understand it. It is troubling, but even more 
troubling than the partisanship of the meeting is the fact that 
the meeting appeared to potentially violate the Government in 
the Sunshine Act, and you know that act. It may require that, 
for the CFTC in its current form, you have got two of three 
members of the CFTC meeting, that it must be open to the public 
unless an exemption applies. It appears to me, based on your 
tweet, discussing better harmonization of Dodd-Frank 
regulations and the rules involve policy discussions that, to 
my mind, should have been open to the public. So let me run 
down just a few questions for which I was just looking for a 
yes-or-no answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">    Did the information shared during the meeting relate to 
national defense?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> Was the meeting related solely to internal
personnel rules and practices?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> The meeting was a briefing by staffs of the
two agencies on progress that had or had not been made in the--
statutorily required harmonization of Dodd-Frank rules between 
the two agencies.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> Did the meeting have any discussion of the
current state of looking at what is going on with the 
unraveling of the Dodd-Frank regulations?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> Was the meeting related to accusing a person
of a crime?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> Was the meeting related to information where
disclosure would constitute a breach of privacy?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> Was the meeting related to investigatory
records where the information would harm the proceedings?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> You know, can I say what the meeting was?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> Sure.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> The meeting was a briefing by staffs that
had worked on harmonization efforts as statutorily required. 
And the meeting was overseen by the Office of General Counsel 
to make sure that it did not breach the--what is called 
regulation in the Sunshine Act.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> Was the meeting related to information which
would lead to financial speculation or endanger the stability 
of any financial institution?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> The meeting did not concern any particular
financial institution.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> Was the meeting related to the agencies
participation in legal proceedings?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> You know, I am almost uncomfortable calling
it a meeting. It was a briefing. And no legal proceedings were 
discussed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> Why then was the meeting not open to the
public when that is something that is required and you are 
talking about, as you said, the harmonization of Dodd-Frank? 
And making it such a partisan effort----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> It is not a partisan effort, first of all,
because any rulemaking that would come out of this would have 
to go through the Administrative Procedure Act. My fellow 
Democratic Commission was briefed on all the issues discussed

    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> The harmonization efforts are Chairman-led
efforts at both the SEC and the CFTC. So Chairman Massad never 
involved me in any----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> I am not asking about Chairman Massad's----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> Of course. But it is a Chairman-led effort,
and the staff was briefing us on progress that had been made so 
we could get up to speed when our predecessors left the 
agencies and to see what needs to be done going forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> I don't know what your general counsel said,
but as I understand the Sunshine Act requires that CFTC--when 
two of the members of the CFTC meet, it must be open to the 
public, unless an exemption applies.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> And we were assured that an exemption
applied for briefings. In fact, meetings take place routinely 
at the agency where staff brief Commissioners, and those 
meetings are closed to the public.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Ms. DeLauro"> What was the exemption? What is the nature of
the exemption?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Giancarlo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Giancarlo"> It is nondeliberation of Commission matters.
It was a briefing only; it was a one-way information flow.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DeLauro</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">Well, thank you. Thank you for the
clarification of that, but I just think when we are talking 
about these critical issues these days, it would be good to 
have the transparency that we have so lacked in the past with 
regard to so many of the these critically important areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Ms. DeLauro">    Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Aderholt</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Thank you, Ms. DeLauro.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">Mr. Chairman, thank you for being here. I think we had a 
good hearing today to discuss some of these issues and bring up 
some issues that the members of this subcommittee feel are 
important. Thank you for sharing and bringing us up to date. 
And we look forward as we continue on with the fiscal year 2019 
appropriation bill that affects your agency. So we look forward 
to working with you, and thank you for your service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Aderholt">And the hearing is adjourned.</paragraph>
