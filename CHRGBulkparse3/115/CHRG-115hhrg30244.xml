    <Doc-title>REGULATORY REFORM TASK FORCES CHECK-IN: PART II</Doc-title>
    <paragraph paraId="0" speaker="">Room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Gary J. Palmer 
[chairman of the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Affairs] 
presiding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="">    Present: Representatives Palmer, Grothman, Walker, Meadows, 
Mitchell, Demings, Krishnamoorthi, DeSaulnier, Norton, Watson 
Coleman, and Kelly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Palmer">The Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Affairs
and the Subcommittee on Healthcare Benefits and Administrative 
Rules will come to order. Without objection, the chair is 
authorized to declare a recess at any time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I now recognize myself for 5 minutes for my opening 
statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Palmer">First of all, I want to welcome three more agencies to 
discuss the administration's efforts to clean up and reduce the 
country's out-of-control regulatory state. Last month, the 
committee heard from the Department of Defense, the Department 
of Transportation, and the General Services Administration on 
their implementation of Executive Orders 13771 and 13777. These 
executive orders create a process by which agencies must refill 
two regulations for every new regulation it wants to issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Palmer">The regulatory reform task forces help identify regulations 
for repeal and coordinate the review process within the agency. 
I can say that it is truly impressive to see the focus that the 
agencies have placed on this initiative and the work that is 
being done for the American public and the enthusiasm with 
which it's being conducted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Palmer">At our last hearing, the Department of Defense reported 
identifying over $10 million in savings and is on track to 
review all of its regulations by the end of 2018. The GSA has 
generated nearly 1800 proposals to reduce regulatory burden on 
vendors and the public stating it is optimistic the work of its 
task force will have a significant impact on improving GSA's 
regulatory and operational landscape. And when you hear that 
1800 proposals have been submitted, I would--it sounds like 
it's more than a task force, that there are a lot of people 
engaged in this. That's exactly what we hoped would happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Palmer">The Department of Transportation shared how its reviews 
have been able to save the American public significant time and 
money without reducing the safety of the Nation's 
transportation system. And by way of example, in fiscal year 
2016, under the previous administration, Department of 
Transportation issued rules opposing an estimated $3.2 billion 
in cost. The rules issued in 2017 have resulted in 
approximately $21.9 million in savings. This is meaningful 
progress. In many cases, it's the task forces and the staff 
that are the driving force and expertise behind the agency's 
reviews and recommendations. And, again, what we've seen in our 
first hearing is not only a commitment to do it but enthusiasm 
for doing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Palmer">We look forward to hearing how your task forces are working 
with these subject matter experts, many of whom intimately 
understand what is duplicative, outdated, or imposes the most 
burden on the public. I'm also encouraged that my colleagues 
across the aisle identified important areas for review, such as 
agency guidance documents which often have the effect of a 
regulation, and I'm pleased to hear the progress that agencies 
are making in their review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I would finally like to echo the praise Chairman Meadows 
bestowed at our last hearing and applaud your efforts and the 
time you've taken testify today. Ultimately, the work you are 
doing with these task forces represent an important first step 
in a necessary culture change with respect to how our 
government works with and not at States, local governments, and 
the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I now recognize the ranking member of intergovernmental 
affairs, Mrs. Demings, for 5 minutes for her opening statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Mrs. Demings. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank 
Chairman Palmer for holding this important hearing today on 
agency regulatory reform task forces. I would also like to 
thank our three witnesses for joining us this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Regulatory review and reform need not be a partisan 
exercise. President Obama too created a retrospective review 
process in 2011 to review outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, 
or excessively burdensome regulations. But the Trump 
administration, I believe, has not taken a balanced look back. 
The Trump regulatory review process is aimed at removing 
regulations that protect the public, including student loan 
borrowers, those in need of health insurance, and even meat 
processing workers. The regulatory reform task force at the 
Department of Health and Human Services is undermining the 
Affordable Care Act to make it harder for average Americans to 
get health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Palmer">The Department of Health and Human Services has undermined 
the open enrollment period by unnecessarily shortening the time 
for enrollment, reducing the number of individuals providing 
enrollment assistance, and cutting the advertising budget by 90 
percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Palmer">And even when individuals are able to buy health insurance, 
the regulatory reform task force has proposed allowing States 
slash what the plans actually cover. The task force at the 
Department of Agriculture is speeding up production lines and 
poultry and hog slaughter facilities and reducing the number of 
inspectors required to be onsite. High-speed production lines 
have been shown to increase risk to health workers and 
potentially lead to contamination of meat products consumed by 
American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Palmer">The task force at the Department of Education is actively 
rolling back regulations meant to protect the next generation 
of K through 12 and higher education students. They are 
obstructing the gainful employment rule meant to ensure that 
college students taking out loans will receive an education 
enabling them to get higher-paying jobs by stopping the 
necessary data collection that would make the rule operate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Palmer">They have halted the borrowers defense rule which created a 
process for defrauded borrowers to apply for loan forgiveness 
to which they are legally entitled and protect American 
taxpayers by requiring certain schools to set money aside to 
cover the cost of loan forgiveness rather than requiring the 
public to bear the burden of fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Palmer">The Department of Education has been long rolling back 
several Title IX regulatory guidance documents which permit 
schools to make it much more difficult for victims of sexual 
assault to obtain justice and causing confusion about whether 
transgender students have any legal protections at all. This is 
very, very concerning to me. I hope it's concerning to others. 
And it's certainly concerning to the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Palmer">During today's hearing, I hope we can understand the aims 
of the task forces at these three agencies and how they intend 
to protect American families' health, safety, and economic 
security. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today, 
and we thank the chairman for holding this very important 
oversight hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> I'll now recognize the ranking member of the
Subcommittee of Healthcare, Benefits and Administrative Rules, 
Mr. Krishnamoorthi, for 5 minutes for his opening statement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Thank you, Chairman Jordan and Chairman
Palmer, for convening this hearing today. I'd also like to 
thank Ranking Member Demings for her friendship and leadership 
and all other witnesses for participating today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">This is the second hearing our subcommittees have had on 
regulatory reform task forces, and I'm very pleased that we 
have the witnesses here today that we do. In particular, I am 
pleased we have a representative from the Department of Health 
and Human Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">My constituents know that having health insurance saves 
lives. It is for this reason that I am deeply troubled by 
recent Trump administration actions that undermine the health 
protections and coverage that millions of Americans have come 
to depend on through the Affordable Care Act, also known as 
ObamaCare. The administration's actions and proposed 
regulations are literally making it harder for Americans to 
receive health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">The Department of Health and Human Services has cut in half 
the open enrollment period for plans to be purchased on the 
health exchanges, meaning that some individuals will either not 
have health insurance or will be penalized for obtaining 
insurance late. The administration has cut the open enrollment 
advertising budget by 90 percent and is waiving requirements 
that States contact difficult-to-reach individuals, meaning 
that many people living in rural areas may not even know they 
need to sign up for health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">The administration has refused to provide funds to 
stabilize the healthcare market as required by law. Failing to 
do so has raised premiums and deductibles for families buying 
health insurance on the exchanges and will end up costing 
American taxpayers more in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">HHS has also permitted all employers to deny female 
employees no copay access to contraception. HHS has proposed 
allowing States to lower standards for essential health 
benefits so that States can engage in a race to the bottom in 
terms of what health insurance plans are required to cover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Similarly, the administration has proposed expanding short-
term, limited-duration plans which need not meet the 
requirements of traditional health plans permitting healthy 
individuals to circumvent the ACA's requirements nearly in 
total. HHS has also proposed loosening the medical loss ratio 
so that insurance plans can spend more on advertising and 
executive salaries and less on doctors, nurses, surgeries, and 
medications for those who need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">These are just the beginning of all the actions the 
administration is taking to undermine the Affordable Care Act. 
There is an old saying that there is no Republican or 
Democratic way to pick up the trash or fill a pothole. The only 
thing that matters is that you deliver for your constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">I think we should increase inefficiencies and cut 
unnecessary regulations as long as doing so improves the 
quality and availability of healthcare for all Americans. 
Unfortunately, that does not appear to be what the Trump 
regulatory task forces are doing. Instead, in this case, their 
task force is making it harder for Americans to get quality 
health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">I'm very grateful to the chairman for calling this hearing 
so we can further investigate the reasons behind the 
administrative actions at issue and the policy goals they 
serve. However, I will be asking some important questions about 
the effects of these actions on the availability of healthcare 
coverage on the exchanges. I look forward to discussing this 
and other issues with the witnesses today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    Thank you, and I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I'm pleased to introduce our witnesses. Mr. Robert Eitel, 
senior counsel to the Secretary at the Department of Education; 
Ms. Rebeckah Adcock, senior adviser to the Secretary at the 
Department of Agricultural; and Mr. Charles Keckler, associate 
deputy secretary at the Department of Health and Human 
Services. Welcome to you all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Pursuant to committee rules, all witnesses will be sworn in 
before they testify. Please rise and raise your right hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Do you solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you're about 
to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 
truth, so help you God?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Palmer">The record will reflect all witnesses answered in the 
affirmative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Please be seated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Palmer">In order to allow time for discussion, please limit your 
testimony to 5 minutes. Your entire written statement will be 
made part of the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Palmer">As a reminder, the clock in front of you shows the 
remaining time. Unlike a traffic light, when the light turns 
yellow, you do need to speed up, you have 30 seconds left, and 
red when your time is up. And I'll remind you if that doesn't 
get your attention.</paragraph>

microphone on before speaking.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF ROBERT EITEL</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ROBERT EITEL">    I would now ask Mr. Eitel to give his testimony.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Good morning, Chairman Palmer, Ranking Member
Demings, Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi, and members of the 
subcommittees. I'm delighted to be here today to present the 
work of the Department of Education in the area of regulatory 
reform and to provide you with an update on its progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Regulatory review and reform are a top priority of 
Secretary DeVos in the Department. It is critical that the 
Department maintain regulations and guidance that are 
understandable, clear, and effective, and that they actually 
serve the interests of students, parents, teachers, and other 
stakeholders. To that end, in April, Secretary DeVos convened a 
task force of career civil servants and noncareer appointees 
appointing as co-chairs a senior civil servant from the Office 
of the General Counsel, who is also our regulatory policy 
officer, and myself, its regulatory reform officer. She also 
directed that the task force conduct itself with three guiding 
principles in mind: Transparency, stakeholder engagement, and 
thoughtful deliberation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Eitel">So with regard to transparency, the task force has taken 
transparency seriously. Indeed, to that end, it has posted on 
the Department website two reports: A progress reported dated 
May 25 and a status report dated October 18, together with 
extensive attachments describing the activity of the task force 
to date. We will continue to provide public updates as the 
Department's regulatory reform work continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Eitel">With regard to stakeholder engagement, the task force has 
also taken to heart the Secretary's direction to engage the 
public concerning its regulatory review. This public engagement 
is, in fact, a requirement of Executive Order 13777 and, for 
that matter, Executive Orders 12866 from 1993 and Executive 
Order 13563 from 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Eitel">So how did the task force accomplish this worthy goal of 
stakeholder engagement? First, the Department published a 
Federal register notice in June asking for public comment on 
which, if any, regulations and guidance to repeal, modify, 
replace, or to keep. The Department provided the public with 90 
days to submit comments to regulations.gov and received in 
excess of 16,000 comments about its regulations and guidance by 
the time the comment period closed on September 20th. The 
Department is presently reviewing those comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Second, at the request of the task force, each principal 
office in the Department engaged in stakeholder outreach to its 
constituency. So for, by way of illustration, the office of 
post-secondary education has public hearings at South Lake 
Community College in Utah and at the Department of Education. 
Other offices conducted their own outreach efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Eitel">With regard to the principle of thoughtful deliberation, 
the task force has taken several considered steps to comply 
with the executive orders. The first step that the task force 
took was simply to catalog all of the Department's regulation 
and guidance. That is to ask what do we have in terms of 
regulations and guidance on the books?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Turning first to regulations, we found that the Department 
maintained in excess of 150 departmental regulations. As part 
of its initial review, four regulations or proposed regulations 
in the area of elementary and secondary education were 
identified for withdrawal, mostly because they were simply out 
of date and related to programs that had not been authorized by 
a Congress. And two regulations in the area of higher education 
were identified for negotiated rulemaking. The Department will 
be withdrawing the elementary and secondary rules in the coming 
months and has begun negotiated rulemaking on the higher 
education rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Turning to guidance. We discovered, to our amazement, that 
the Department maintained an astounding 1,772 policy-oriented 
guidance documents, including Dear Colleague letters, FAQs, 
policy memos and the like. Of these, nearly 600 items were 
simply out of date, some of them dating back to the early 
1980s, and interpreting laws that were no longer in effect or 
relating to long-ago events, such as the flooding in the upper 
Midwest that occurred in 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Based on recommendations from career staff in each 
principal office and with the approval of career attorneys in 
the office of general counsel, and I would like to stress that, 
based on the recommendations of career staff and after review 
by career attorneys, the Department took steps to withdraw this 
out-of-date guidance to provide clarity to the public. That 
guidance is attached to our October 18th report on the Web.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Adcock">Chairman, ranking members, and members of the
committee, thank you for the invitation to testify before your 
subcommittees today. As a designated regulatory reform officer 
for the Department of Agriculture, I am pleased to share with 
you Secretary Perdue's commitment to fulfilling the President's 
promise to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens and barriers 
within the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Adcock">In line with Executive Orders 13771 and 13777, Secretary 
Perdue is determined to obey the practice of legislating 
through Department regulations and guidance and staying within 
the bounds of congressional authority. USDA embraces the five 
regulatory reform principles of reducing regulatory burdens and 
process barriers, regulating effectively and efficiently, 
promoting due process, providing fair notice and transparency, 
and respecting individual freedoms and property rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Adcock">Consistent with the executive orders, it's our goal to 
collaborate with the public and identify regulations that are 
creating more problems than they're solving. And to achieve 
that goal, we published a call for public input on July 17th, 
2017, and that lasts through next July 2018. USDA is receiving 
comments during this time during four rounds of review: 
September and November of this year; February and July of next 
year. To date, USDA has received and begun the review of over 
145 comments. And I believe, actually, the number rose a little 
bit over the last a couple of days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Adcock">Last month, the Secretary held a public listening session 
on cutting the red tape where policy experts, nonprofit 
organizations, and industry groups aired their concerns about 
different regulatory burdens. Those event materials should have 
been supplied to you via the committee for your review. USDA 
listened, and with our submissions to the spring agenda 
released in June and those that will be released in the 
upcoming fall unified regulatory agenda, we are taking actions 
to revise and reconsider regulations and, where appropriate, 
deregulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Adcock">Additionally, as a function of the Secretary's leadership 
of the President's interagency task force on agriculture and 
rural prosperity, USDA held listening sessions with 
stakeholders across the countryside, not aimed solely at 
regulatory reform or barriers. But during his travels through 
rural America, he did hear from producers, business people, 
rural residents, and community leaders on everything from farm 
programs to forest service directives to wetlands and the 
challenges we have there. Some of those ideas and concerns may 
be issues that can be and will be addressed during our ongoing 
review of regulatory and reform process at USDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Adcock">USDA is a very large organization, and it touches the lives 
of virtually every American in ways they don't ever know about. 
We have nearly 100,000 employees made up of dedicated civil 
servants who believe in the work we do to support the 
production of food, fiber, and fuel, as well as the rural 
communities we support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Adcock">Our internal regulatory reform task force is composed 
almost exclusively of career-level senior staff from each of 
our mission areas, agencies, and offices. During their first 
round over the course of the last summer and early fall, 
preparing for the fall agenda, the task force identified over 
275 potential recommendations aimed at decreasing duplication 
and working more efficiently and effectively as an agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Adcock">Some recommendations were administrative actions that were 
as simple as making it happen. And they've been already adopted 
and are underway. But over half of the recommendations were 
potential regulatory reforms, many of which will be reflected 
in the upcoming fall agenda from OMB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Adcock">The Secretary views regulatory and operational reform as an 
ongoing process aimed at improving the culture of how USDA runs 
and relates to our customers and constituents. He expects that 
final regulatory decisions will be lawful, fact-based, and 
supported by data collected through sound scientific 
methodology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Adcock">In addition to the President's five principles, we do our 
best to consider how each regulation or action will--reviewed, 
has an impact on jobs and the economy as well as weighing the 
cost, the benefits, the burdens, and the opportunities to 
stakeholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Adcock">At USDA, we trust in the American people, especially those 
in rural America, to do the right thing for their businesses, 
their communities, and their country. The Federal Government 
must also do our part at minimizing burdens and reducing 
barriers. We know we can do better, and Secretary Perdue and 
the dedicated people of USDA are committed to making that 
happen.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF CHARLES KECKLER</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="CHARLES KECKLER">    The chair now recognizes Mr. Keckler for his testimony. 
Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Jordan,
Chairman Palmer, Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi, Ranking Member 
Demings, and members of the subcommittees. Thank you for the 
opportunity today to discuss the Department of Health and Human 
Services' efforts regarding regulatory reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Keckler">HHS is committed to improving the regulatory process as 
laid out by the President's executive orders, and our 
Department is always willing to engage with both the members of 
this committee and your staff to help us improve our work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Keckler">On February 24th, 2017, the President signed Executive 
Order 13777. It required the head of each agency to designate a 
regulatory reform officer. This officer would oversee the 
implementation of regulatory reform, initiatives, and policies. 
The order also requires agencies to establish a regulatory 
reform task force. This task force was instructed to evaluate 
existing regulations and make recommendations regarding the 
repeal, replacement, or modification of those regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Keckler">The President's February executive order instructed each 
task force to identify regulations that eliminate jobs or 
inhibit job creation and to find regulations that are outdated, 
unnecessary, or ineffective. The task forces must also review 
regulations that impose costs that exceed benefits and evaluate 
regulations that create a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
interfere with regulatory reform initiatives and policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Importantly, this executive order also instructed agencies 
that the task force should seek input and other assistance from 
those entities significantly affected by Federal regulations. 
In particular, agencies should seek input from State and local 
governments, small businesses, and consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Keckler">HHS established its regulatory reform task force on April 
13th, 2017. The task force meets once per week to evaluate 
deregulatory proposals from operating and staff divisions 
across HHS using instructions and criteria outlined in 
Executive Orders 13771, and 13777, and OMB guidance documents 
M1721, and M1723.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Keckler">The deregulatory proposals are presented to the task force 
for consideration only after they have been evaluated by 
regulatory reform working groups. The working groups are 
designed to offer a forum for the Department's subject matter 
experts to carefully assess deregulatory proposals using 
criteria that complement the goals of the executive orders. 
Each working group meets regularly and consists of 15 to 23 
career staff experts from across HHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Each operating and staff division has a regulatory reform 
officer who is responsible for submitting deregulatory 
proposals once per month to the relevant working groups. The 
deregulatory proposals are then assessed by the working groups 
and ultimately the task force. The RRO is also charged with 
communicating important information on regulatory reform to 
their respective division. Once a month, a call is held with 
the RROs to answer questions and share best practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Keckler">The regulatory reform process at the Department of Health 
and Human Services encompasses all agency rulemaking including 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. CMS is 
committed to putting patients first and easing the regulatory 
burden that is harming the relationship between a patient and 
his or her doctor and other type of healthcare provider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Regulations have their place and are important to ensuring 
quality, integrity, and safety in our healthcare system. But, 
if rules are misguided, outdated, or too complex, they can have 
a suffocating effect on healthcare delivery by shifting the 
focus of providers away from patients and toward unnecessary 
paperwork and ultimately increase the cost of care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Keckler">CMS Administrator Verma has launched a review of all 
quality measures, for example, to ensure they are most 
meaningful. Too often, healthcare quality measures focus on 
process and not whether on that process has improved the 
quality or safety of healthcare. Clinicians and hospitals have 
to report an array of measures to different payors. These 
measures are often different, and there are many steps involved 
in submitting them, taking time away from patients. For 
example, across CMS hospital quality reporting programs, in-
patient hospitals report up to 61 quality measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Keckler">According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, 
some family practitioners have to report nearly 30 measures to 
seven different payors which can lead to less time focused on 
patients and contribute to clinicians' burnout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Through CMS' review, we will focus measurement on assessing 
those core issues that are most vital to providing high quality 
care and improving patient outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Thank you for your opportunity to testify today. I am glad 
the committee is taking the time to review the complex and 
often overbearing regulatory system that exists in the United 
States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Stakeholder feedback is critical to the part of work we are 
undertaking at HHS to reduce regulatory burden. As we reach out 
and listen to providers, patients, experts, and consumers, I 
wish to note that Congress remains our most valued stakeholder. 
Please know that our Department is always ready to discuss any 
regulations that you believe are problematic or those that need 
to be strengthened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Keckler">In preparing for this hearing, we've had several productive 
conversations with both majority and minority committee staff. 
I want to thank them for their thoughtful effort they put into 
this matter. We look forward to working with them even more in 
the future.</paragraph>

    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. 
Mitchell for, 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">I came to the hearing today in admittedly the naive hope 
that we'd actually talk about regulatory improvement and 
streamlining and not simply the political environment. You'd 
think after 10 months I'd learn better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they don't 
want to be this political process and then immediately proceed 
to suggest or directly indicate that any action that you take 
to repeal regulations has some stealth political aim rather 
than simply be a belief that regulations need to make sense. In 
fact, it would be nice if they weren't outdated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">Mr. Eitel, let me start with you. I note you were talking 
about 150 regulations for review and 1772 guidance documents, 
with your colleague letters, policy letters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">    My understanding, having experience with some of that, is 
that those letters aren't subject to a most political 
rulemaking, comment, review. They're issued by the Department, 
and they have the effect of law unless challenged in court, 
correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> It is true that guidance is supposed to be
simply that, that it is guidance from the Department to assist 
our stakeholders in navigating the laws and regulations that 
they have to abide by. Guidance, as a consequence, as it can be 
simply issued by the agency, can be simply withdrawn by the 
agency in accordance with OMB guidance.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Rules, on the other hand, that is the
regulations, must go through the rulemaking process. So that 
rule which we wish to promulgate must go through the rulemaking 
process, the MPRM, et cetera. To withdraw it, we have to a 
follow a similar procedure.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">But one of the challenges with ``Dear
Colleague'' letters and the like is that the Department takes 
action based on their interpretation of regulations without any 
public comment or discussion, whether that interpretation, in 
fact, is a valid interpretation. And that happens a number of 
times in a variety of agencies, including the Department of Ed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">    How was it that we get beyond a huge number of policy 
guidances and just have some regulations that make some sense? 
How do we reduce that burden?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> I think there needs to be a return to the
requirements at the APA. And that is when an agency, a Federal 
agency, desires to bind the public with a rule, it should go 
through notice and comment rulemaking, generally, in accordance 
with OMB guidance and the APA.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Let's talk briefly, since my colleague wanted
to make a comment, in my opinion, a political comment, about 
gainful employment and the fact you withdrew the regulation 
pending, an NPRM, and rewriting that regulation. What was the 
rationale of the Department for withdrawing that regulation, 
sir?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> I was not personally involved in the decision to
commence negotiated rulemaking on gainful employment. I am 
personally recused from that matter, and I've had no role in it 
personally.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Mitchell"> Sorry. I should have known that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> I would also add that, based on what I have read
in the media and the Federal Register, that rule will be 
undergoing negotiated rulemaking, and it would be, I think, 
inappropriate for me to comment anyway on that issue.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">Well, allow me to take a moment to comment on
it, which was one of the fundamental problems of gainful 
employment, which my colleagues should know, is that it only 
assessed, theoretically assessed, was questionable data. The 
success rates of private career schools. They failed to provide 
information to consumers or the Department on the success rates 
of universities, colleges, community colleges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">In fact, it was politically targeted, and the data is 
flawed. That's the underlying reason why we're dealing with 
gainful employment again, or some version of that. And it will 
be an issue we'll deal with in education workforce. So I look 
forward to engaging in that conversation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">Ms. Adcock, in the few minutes I've got left, for better or 
for worse, you gained more name ID. I'm sorry for you. I truly 
am.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">    In the last--since you joined the Department, how many 
meetings with various stakeholders have you had roughly, do you 
think? Estimate. I understand it's an estimate.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I would really--a dozen, a half--or a dozen or
two. I--a lot more internal meetings. Most of my effort has 
been focused on regulatory reform and rural prosperity.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mitchell</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">I understand. And the point I wanted to make
was that there's no one sitting in this room in a policymaking 
position, including on this dais, that does not spend quality 
time meeting with stakeholders throughout the industry that we 
deal with. Take the transparency, Mr. Eitel and I have met 
previously. I can't tell you the number of education groups I 
met with, agriculture groups I met with, both businesses as 
well as farm bureau and others. The reality is that's part of 
the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">So I am sorry that your integrity was questioned by 
comments that you had actually had the temerity to groups that 
you folks would deal with that were in the industry. It 
shouldn't happen, and I'm sorry for you, and welcome to 
Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Mitchell">    With that, I yield back, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Palmer">The chair now recognizes the ranking member,
Mrs. Demings, for her questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Mrs. Demings. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And I feel 
compelled to comment--make a comment regarding my colleague's 
comment. Perhaps he's a little overly sensitive today because 
he finds himself another year older. Today is his birthday. But 
everything's going to be okay, Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I don't--I have not heard anyone say that any action or any 
effort to remove any regulation is totally unacceptable. That 
is not what we are trying to do here. What we are trying to do 
is make sure that every action that is taken either by Congress 
or by you and your agencies protects the American public. And I 
think that is all of our responsibility, whether it is our 
birthday or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Palmer">The Obama Department of Education issued the borrower 
defense rule which created a process, as you all know, for 
defrauded borrowers to apply for loan forgiveness to which they 
are legally entitled and protect American taxpayers by 
requiring certain schools to set aside money to cover the cost 
of loan forgiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    Mr. Eitel, was the idea of postponement that we're seeing 
out of the current administration originally your idea? And if 
it was or wasn't, which role did you personally--or what role 
did you personally play in the postponement or the rewrite?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Congresswoman, as you know, the rule is
undergoing revision in negotiated rulemaking as we speak. It 
would be inappropriate for me to talk about the subject matter 
of the borrower defense regulation while that negotiated 
rulemaking is occurring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. Was the postponement your idea?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Eitel">To say that it was my idea would not be
accurate. There is an entire infrastructure in place at the 
Department that deals with borrower defense matters and other 
regulatory matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. Are you involved in the rewrite?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Eitel">No. That matter is undergoing, negotiated
rulemaking, as we speak. And I cannot comment on negotiate 
rulemaking that is occurring presently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Eitel">I would also add that the borrower defense rule is being--
or the decision by the Department has been challenged in 
litigation. And for that matter, I also cannot speak on the 
borrower defense regulatory matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. So can you answer did you speak with anyone 
at the White House about the rule? Yes or no.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Eitel">I cannot speak to that given the posture of
litigation and given the fact that we are engaged in negotiated 
rulemaking on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. And please explain your reason again for not 
being able to answer yes-or-no questions about who you spoke 
with about it, whether the Secretary of Education or anyone at 
the White House. What's your rationale again, please, for that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Eitel">The rationale is that the matter is in
negotiated rulemaking. It would be inappropriate for me to 
comment on the rule in any way, shape, or form. And in addition 
to that, the rule--the decisions of the Department on this 
matter have been challenged in litigation, and there is ongoing 
litigation proceeding as we speak in Federal court. I cannot 
comment further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. Can you tell me, between February 13th and 
April 5th, when the OMB report came out, were you employed at 
Bridgepoint Education?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Eitel">I was on unpaid leave of absence from
Bridgepoint Education during that time----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. So you were employed at Bridgepoint, if you 
were on a leave of absence.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Eitel">That's correct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. You were still employed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Eitel">It was an unpaid leave of absence from
Bridgepoint Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. But you were employed by Bridgepoint 
Education.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Eitel">I was on an unpaid leave of absence from
Bridgepoint Education. And to explain further, I consulted with 
the Department's ethics officer prior to coming to the 
Department. I met with her, received advice, and complied with 
that advice fully and completely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. And what was the advice that you received?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Eitel">That I could come to the Department, that I
could work at the Department on an unpaid leave of absence and 
recuse myself from matters--particular matters involving 
specific and prior employers that I worked for in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. Okay. And how long were you in that unpaid 
status? Do you remember?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Well, to be clear, I was in an unpaid status
from Bridgepoint Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. Right. How long were you----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Eitel">I joined the Department on February 13th----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Eitel">--and formally resigned in early April.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mrs. Demings. Okay. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I 
yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> The chair now recognizes the gentleman from
North Carolina, Mr. Meadows, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for
conducting this hearing. And as we look at regulatory reform, I 
guess--is it Eitel?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Eitel, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Meadows">Eitel. Okay. All right. That's a little tough
for a North Carolina Member to get it correct on the first 
drop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Meadows">    So, Mr. Eitel, let me come to you. If we're looking at 
regulatory reform, and as you have just demonstrated to my 
colleague opposite, during negotiations it would be 
inappropriate to talk about the negotiations that go back and 
forth, will Congress be able to review that, any 
recommendations that you made coming back to Congress in the 
formal rulemaking process? Is there a statute that would allow 
us to do that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Not to my knowledge. In connection with
negotiated rulemaking under the----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> But when you make your final decision, does
that not come back to Congress?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Well, there is a notification requirement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Right. And so we would still have a review
period as outlined for our congressional responsibility; is 
that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> I believe so, under the congressional review act
sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> All right. So let me go back to guidance,
because you talked about guidance a little bit ago, and that's 
one of those areas that I have, I guess, a keen sense of 
guidance being offered that is never noticed to Congress and 
yet has the same effects of a rule. How many would you say 
guidance is out there? How many different guidance memos would 
be out there that have the effect of a rule in your particular 
agency?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Well, we did do a canvass at the beginning of
the process, and we discovered that we had 1,772 pieces of 
guidance in the form of ``Dear Colleagues,'' policy memos, 
FAQs, and the like. The question is to what extent do they have 
the force of law.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Well, but we know that they, many times, do
have the force of law, because we've actually had that 
litigated when you--in their juris prudence that would suggest 
many times the guidance has the enforce of a rule.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> That is correct, sir. The guidance is----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> So out of those 1700-plus guidance memos and
Dear Colleagues, how many of those were noticed to Congress?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> I do not know that for sure, but I would
imagine----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Can you get that back to us?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Yes, I think so.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> You would think there would be none, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> So if it has the effect of being a rule, and
it wasn't noticed to Congress, would you not see a problem with 
that from a standpoint of being enforced as a rule? Would you 
not see that as a way to get around the rulemaking notice 
provision that is in statute?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> It could present a problem to the agency.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Because you could just pass one rule and do 20
guidance memos, and Congress would never be able to weigh in. 
Do you not see that as a problem?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> I do see that as a problem.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Okay. Can you get that to this committee in
terms of how many guidance memos were not noticed?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Okay. Ms. Adcock, can you do the same for
USDA?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> All right. So would you see it as a problem?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> Yes, sir. We are in the process of cataloging,
understanding better where our breadth of guidance documents 
are throughout the agency, yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> So what would you estimate your guidance
documents, the breadth of that would be?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> More than 1700 that Mr. Eitel has----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I would think less. I would think less.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> You would think less. Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Keckler">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Meadows">You probably figured I was coming down the
road, so I guess you prepared for this answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Meadows">    All right. So----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Sir, we have begun a review of the extensive
number of guidance documents within the Department. But I, as I 
sit here today, am not in a position to give you an estimate or 
a number, but we can certainly get back to you with----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> What's a reasonable amount of time to get that
to this committee?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> With regard to how many----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Yeah. I mean, if you've started your canvass,
is it going to go on for 2 years or--I mean, can you get that 
number to this committee in the next 45 days?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> We can make a determined effort whether----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> You're starting to sound like a politician. I
need a time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> We'll give you an answer, with an estimate, in
90 days.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> With an estimate of what?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Of our policy documents.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> I tell you what.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Let's change this.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Meadows"> Within 14 days, get to this committee your
plan of action on how you're going to address that request. How 
about that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Meadows</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Meadows">All right. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Meadows">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> The chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois, Mr. Krishnamoorthi, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">I'm deeply worried that actions that HHS have taken leading 
up to and during this 2018 open enrollment season will cause 
more Americans to go without health coverage. From cutting the 
funds for outreach to cutting the open enrollment season in 
half from 90 to 45 days, to shuttering healthcare.gov every 
Sunday from 12:00 a.m. To 12:00 p.m. During the open enrollment 
season, one could be forgiven for assuming that HHS wants fewer 
Americans to have health insurance. I'm pleased that Ranking 
Member Cummings has taken a keen interest in this and that we 
have been investigating the, quote/unquote, ``maintenance 
windows'' that are going to be happening every Sunday and their 
affect on American's ability to enroll in health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    Mr. Keckler, are you aware that, on September 29th, Ranking 
Member Cummings and I sent a letter to HHS requesting documents 
relating to the decision to schedule website maintenance 
downtime during open enrollment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> No, sir, I'm not personally aware of that
letter.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi"> Were you aware that, on November 3rd,
HHS officials briefed us and said they would provide the 
documents that we requested within 1 week?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> No, sir, I was also not part of that process.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi"> Are you aware that, on November 13th,
HHS finally replied and sent a letter that failed to provide 
the documents we had requested?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> No, sir, I was not aware of that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">In fact, what they provided us were
these four sheets of paper, the sum total of their document 
production. These four sheets of paper are insufficient. 
They're the only data they provided in yesterday's letter. I'm 
not sure if you can see it from here, but this is hardly the 
full data that we requested regarding the decision to 
maintain--quote/unquote, maintain the website and take it down 
for 12 hours every Sunday during open enrollment. In fact, one 
of these pages is nothing but a screenshot that tells people 
the website is down without even telling them when to come back 
to enroll. This is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    Mr. Keckler, are you aware of CMS administrator Verma's 
claim on November 7th that increasing Medicaid enrollment 
numbers was a, quote/unquote, ``hollow victory?''
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> I'm not--I did not participate in that
statement or I have seen a report in the media to that effect.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi"> Do you agree with her that more
Americans having access to healthcare via increased Medicaid is 
a ``hollow victory?''
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> I'm not certain what that--what her meaning
was in that statement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi"> Okay. What is the plain meaning of that
to you? What does ``hollow victory'' mean to you, and would you 
characterize increased Medicaid enrollment as a hollow victory?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> That's not a term that I would use as I'm not
sure precisely what is meant by it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">And that's not a term I would use
either. I agree with you. And I hope that you admonish 
Administrator Verma from using terms like that to describe 
increased Medicaid enrollment numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">Mr. Keckler, I have to say that I profoundly disagree with 
Administrator Verma that more Americans having access to 
healthcare through Medicaid is a hollow victory. It's not a 
hallow victory for people who no longer have to decide between 
paying for their groceries or paying for their healthcare. It's 
not a hollow victory for people who are finally able to get 
treatments for chronic debilitating conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    I've never met a beneficiary of the expanded Medicaid 
expansion program who called it a hollow victory to me. In 
fact, they thought that it was life-changing. And I'd be happy 
to introduce them to you or to Administrator Verma. Mr. 
Keckler, I have one final question. Is it now the policy of HHS 
that fewer Americans should have health coverage through the 
Affordable Care Act?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> I'm not familiar with any such policy.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi"> It's a--so you're saying the answer is
no?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Not to my knowledge.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krishnamoorthi</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">I find it hard to square that sentiment
that you just uttered with the very real actions taken by HHS 
this year, actions that will harm people and that are harming 
people. If you want to increase health coverage, HHS should not 
have cut the ACA outreach budget, should not have cut the open 
enrollment period in half, and should schedule website 
maintenance in a way that does not interfere with people's 
ability to purchase health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Krishnamoorthi">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> The chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Wisconsin, Mr. Grothman, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Grothman">Yeah, I've got some general questions for
you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Grothman">    How many recommendations has your task force reported, or 
your agency had to repeal or amend duplicative, outdated, or 
unnecessary regulatory actions or other policies? Do you just 
have a general number, any of you? Any of you. We'll go to Ms. 
Adcock first.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. Adcock">Yes, I'll start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    Yes. We identified, through the regulatory reform task 
force, over 275 broad actions, and about half of those were 
regulatory. And we're getting ready to dig back in again and 
sort through public comments and dig deeper in what we consider 
round two. So that was our first go at it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Do you other folks have any----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> As for the Department of Education, we have
identified, as of today, six regulations for deregulatory 
action. We have additional items pending on our fall agenda 
that is under review with OMB for the fall. And in addition to 
that, we have withdrawn approximately 600 out-of-date guidance 
documents of various types.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> The Department of Health and Human Services,
our regulatory reform task force gets sort of a--only some of 
the overall regulatory activity that goes on. But thus far, the 
task force itself has made 34 recommendations after receiving 
reports from our working groups for deregulatory actions at 
this time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Grothman">Okay. I'll ask you to respond to something
that could be criticism to what we're doing here, or a concern 
I have. Obviously, they're good regulations--I--``good 
regulations''--but there are mandatory regulations in the sense 
that Congress passes bills that demand interpretation. And so 
you publish new regulations that actually are less burdensome 
on business, less burdensome on other areas in Government. And 
I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Grothman">Could you give me just general statements as far as when 
you withdraw regulations or begin to promulgate new regulations 
as to what you're aiming at. I guess what I'm getting at, like 
I said, is sometimes the only way to deal with a bad regulation 
is to not repeal it because then maybe you offer the underlying 
statute but to improve it or make it less burdensome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Grothman">    And I guess I'd just like a comment from each of you as how 
you're approaching regulations or what you plan on doing. Like 
Mr. Eitel, I don't know if I got that right, you know, a lot of 
us feel the Department of Education is really kind of a thorn 
in the side of local school districts. But your guiding 
principles as far as what principles you use to get rid of 
regulation or promulgate new ones.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Eitel">I think that the--there's a number. I think the
first is legal sufficiency. That is our reacting with the 
intent of Congress based on legislative language and the 
history and the intent of the law, are we going beyond the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Second is to provide clarity and better understanding for 
stakeholders, whether it be a State educational agency or a 
local school district or an educational institution, parents, 
students, and teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    I think the third would be to examine what is the cost of 
the regulation and what is the benefit to the public.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Okay. Any others?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Ms. Adcock">We have followed very closely with the
principles laid out by the President's relating to due process, 
many of the considerations the Department of Education has 
mentioned. We also, at USDA, at the behest of the Secretary, 
are looking into very strongly the cost, the benefits, the 
barriers, the opportunities, what is the impacts on jobs and 
the economy, how does it serve the rural constituents and 
customers that we have through our various agencies, everywhere 
from the Forest Service to our frontline offices at NRCS and 
FSA and our food and nutrition program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    So we are very going through and trying to be very 
thoughtful and using--we're relying very heavily on the 
expertise of the folks that have been at the agency for a long 
time to weigh what they know about how we can do better and--
whether it's operational, regulatory, or otherwise. And as you 
mentioned, it's not always remove the regulation. Often it is 
modernize it or revise it or combine it and find deficiencies 
in those manners.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Grothman">Okay. I'm almost out of time, so I'm going to
jump back to Mr. Eitel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Grothman">    Have you looked at all at the special ed regulations, which 
I think can kind of be unintentionally damaging to some 
children? Is that something you'd review over there or try to 
read to give more flexibility to the local school districts?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> We are looking at that, but we have not made any
final decisions on how to proceed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grothman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Grothman"> Thank you for letting me go over.

    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I am very concerned about the lack of disclosure around 
these task forces at many of the agencies. The task forces are 
making major decisions about the fate of the health, safety, 
and the education of Americans. For example, it is very 
important that the public know who is on the task forces. The 
perspectives and the backgrounds of individual members may 
determine whether a regulation stays or it goes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    Mr. Eitel, the names of the Department of Education's task 
force members is on your website. Why did the Department decide 
to put the name names online?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Eitel">For purposes of public disclosure, so that the
public would know who is on our task force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Eitel">Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you. Good answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Eitel">From today's New York Times, this is an article entitled 
``An Open Door for Pesticide Lobbyist at the USDA.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to insert this 
article into this record.

    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I quote from that article: At a private meeting in 
September, congressional aids asked Rebeckah Adcock, a top 
official at the Department of Agriculture, to reveal the 
identities of the people serving on the deregulation team that 
she leads at the agency. Ms. Adcock, a former pesticide 
industry executive, brushed off the request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Ms. Adcock, you are here before the oversight committee, 
which is a principal investigative committee of Congress, and I 
do have a question for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    Who are the members of the regulatory task force that you 
lead? What are their respective backgrounds, and what is their 
status as a political appointee or a civil servant?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Ms. Adcock">My understanding is from the committee, and I
apologize if your staff thought that I brushed off that 
request. That was not my intention. My intention was to share 
with them that we had not made the list public. We hadn't asked 
the members whether that would be acceptable, and then I would 
take that back to see if we could share that list. So if there 
was a misunderstanding, I apologize for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you. Have you gone back to the 
task force and discussed with these Federal employees whether 
or not it is appropriate to release their names and their 
backgrounds and their status?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Ms. Adcock">It is my understanding that that list has been
forwarded to the committee through our office of congressional 
relations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. When was that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Ms. Adcock">I--it could have been in the last few days. I'm
not certain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. All right. Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Ms. Adcock">But I'm happy--the bottom line is you will be
provided a name. I can give you a brief summary. It's 
approximately 40 people, almost exclusively composed of career 
staff throughout USDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. I'm very interested in that list. Mr. 
Chairman, I would expect for our side to receive that, to share 
that information with us as soon as possible.

    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Keckler">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Why not?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Keckler">It's not--this is an internal group, the
deliberative group. We normally thus far have handled most of 
the outreach via the component agencies of HHS, with a 
stakeholder outreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Mrs. Watson Coleman. Well, Mr. Keckler, let me just say to 
you that this is a particularly unique situation, and the 
decisions that they would be considering have a tremendous 
impact of both positive, I hope, and negative on the 
constituencies that I define as the people of the United States 
of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Keckler">So, given that this may be an internal sort of operational 
situation, it is vitally important that you share this 
information with the public so that we know the kind of people 
and the background and the things that they would be 
considering, because we do know that who you are will affect 
how you react to certain things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Keckler">    Can you possibly make those available to us?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Yes, ma'am. We'll be happy to send that list
to you. In my written testimony today, the composition of the 
task force, in terms of the positions of persons, is provided, 
but we can also send you a list of the current members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Keckler">Mrs. Watson Coleman. Yes. And you know what, this request 
is not only for your three agencies in general, Mr. Chairman. 
We should ask each of the departments to share this information 
with us. These are very important considerations that are going 
to take place, and transparency is very important as well as 
ensuring that there are no conflicts of interest anywhere in 
the deliberations of these issues. And sometimes that whole 
issue of conflict of interest has arisen very much in this 
current administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Keckler">    With that, I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. 
Kelly, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Ms. Kelly">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Ms. Kelly">I'm deeply concerned about the way the Department of Health 
and Human Services is treating the neediest among us. Medicaid 
was created to ensure that the Nation's poor had access to 
quality healthcare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Ms. Kelly">A provision of the Social Security Act, Section 1115, gives 
the HHS Secretary the authority to approve State experimental, 
pilot, or demonstration projects that are, quote, ``likely to 
assist in promoting the objectives of the Medicaid program.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Ms. Kelly">This administration has received a number of 1115 waiver 
requests, and I am concerned that not all of the proposed 
projects will actually help ensure that Medicaid recipients get 
the healthcare they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Ms. Kelly">    Mr. Keckler, what are the objectives of the Medicaid 
program?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Keckler">That's beyond--it's sort of general sort of
programmatic goals. That's not an area that I've been briefed 
on for today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Keckler">    Obviously, it's designed to provide healthcare for low-
income Americans.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Ms. Kelly">Well, for example, some States have proposed
imposing work requirements on Medicaid recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Ms. Kelly">    Does imposing a work requirement promote the objective of 
ensuring all income-eligible for Medicaid receive health 
insurance?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> I think that my answer to that would be I can
take that back for something that can be analyzed by our 
subject matter experts in that and their views, and we can 
answer that in a fuller way in a written form.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Ms. Kelly">I look forward to your answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Ms. Kelly">Also, some States have proposed adding premiums. This means 
that individuals on Medicaid who are often already below the 
poverty level would pay for health insurance that should be 
their right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Ms. Kelly">    Does adding premiums promote the objective of ensuring all 
people income-eligible for Medicaid receive health insurance?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Again, ma'am, I think that a better answer for
that would be provided in terms of a policy analysis and answer 
that we can provide to you in a written form.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Ms. Kelly">Well, I have another one for you. Some States
have proposed limiting retroactive eligibility, meaning that 
States will not provide Medicaid for months prior to the month 
in which the individual is enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. Kelly">    Does limiting retroactive eligibility promote the objective 
of ensuring all people income-eligible for Medicaid receive 
health insurance?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Again, I think a better answer could be
provided to you by those that are--have a deeper familiarity 
with the policy elements.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Ms. Kelly"> Is that true for the case of States that have
proposed drug screening for applicants? Are you going to give 
me the same answer?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Yes, ma'am.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kelly</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Kelly">Okay. Well, thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Ms. Kelly">Just yesterday, President Trump announced Alex Azar to be 
the new HHS Secretary. It's been reported that Mr. Azar has 
been critical of the ACA's Medicaid expansion and has proposed 
block granting the program in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Ms. Kelly">I hope, if confirmed, he will not attempt to undermine 
Medicaid. We should not make it more difficult for Americans to 
obtain life-saving health insurance, which is a right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Ms. Kelly">    Thank you, and I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I would like to enter into the record a letter from the 
Department of Health and Human Services to our member Mr. 
Krishnamoorthi, and point out that the downtime that was 
scheduled on November 5th for maintenance was completed before 
5 a.m., so it was down less than 5 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Palmer">And on Sunday, November 12th, the downtime from scheduled 
from midnight to noon, but no maintenance was needed and no 
downtime occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    So it will be entered into the record.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from
the District of Columbia, Ms. Holmes Norton, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Norton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Ms. Norton">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Ms. Norton">I have concerns, which I hope can be cleared up without 
referring everything back. I think we're supposed to be talking 
with people who can give us the information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Ms. Norton">And these are the changes that are being made, Ms. Adcock, 
at USDA about the line limits, the speedups. A study has found 
that three-quarters of those who work on these--under these 
fast speeds believe that their jobs are dangerous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Ms. Norton">As I look at what these speeds are, I must say I can't 
blame them as I try to imagine working, for example, under what 
most--where most poultry plants now operate, up to speeds of 
140 birds per minute. But then some plants operate under 
another system. Apparently, it's called the New Poultry 
Inspection System, NPIS. And that allows plants to operate not 
at 140 birds per minute, but 175 birds per minute. And in 
addition, most Federal inspectors are replaced with company 
workers under this NPIS system. I don't understand that at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Ms. Norton">This past September, the National Chicken Council filed a 
petition with USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service to 
allow the remaining plants--and this is getting incredible--the 
remaining plants to operate under this NPIS system and 
increasing the line speeds without any upper limit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. Norton">    Am I still living in the United States of America? Are 
these figures coming out of some Third World country? Ms. 
Adcock, will the Department act on this petition to allow some 
plants to operate under this NPIS system, increasing the line 
speeds without any upper limit? Will the Department act on this 
petition?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I am not personally aware of the petition, and
I don't know that I can tell you today what its status is, but 
I am certainly happy to check in and----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Norton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Ms. Norton">You know, Mr. Chairman, I don't know if the
administration is sending us people who deliberately can say to 
us, we don't know the answer to your question, but this is not 
how the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has ever 
operated before, to allow people to say, I'm sorry, I don't 
know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Ms. Norton">    Now, this is a perfectly obvious question of systems and 
petitions that are before the agency now, and you haven't heard 
of this?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> This is not an issue which has come before my
desk and so I'm not personally aware of it, but I will 
certainly get back to you with a response.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Norton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Ms. Norton"> Well, I guess you will. What else can you say
if you are unaware. And I'm amazed that--what is your position 
again, Ms. Adcock?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I am a senior adviser, working on regulatory
reform and rural prosperity.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Norton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Ms. Norton"> And you never heard of this?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I am not familiar with this particular
petition, because it's not in the subject matter----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Norton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Ms. Norton"> All right. Let me ask you this, since you claim
ignorance, but you know about these speeds. Given your 
expertise, should the Department grant waivers to say you can 
operate at any speed you like?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I'm not familiar with the waiver, so I don't
know the details. I am familiar with the regulatory proposal on 
line speeds. I'm not familiar with the petition.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Norton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Ms. Norton">No, I'm not asking you that. I'm asking you
whether or not--since you said you didn't know anything, so I'm 
not going to ask somebody who tells me I know nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Ms. Norton">    But I'm asking you, in your expertise, should a waiver ever 
be granted to increase speeds without any upper limit?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I simply don't have the expertise to answer
that question in either direction. It would be a disservice to 
those who----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Norton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Ms. Norton"> What is your background, Ms. Adcock?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I have primarily worked on agriculture and
environmental issues.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Norton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Ms. Norton">Yeah. Well, that's what these are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Ms. Norton">Mr. Chairman, I have to say I've heard, you know, these 
answers, these I don't know answers. I hope you will not 
tolerate this, because I'm telling you you're having hearings 
where--for the Oversight and Government Reform Committee where 
you're allowing people to come forward without any information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Ms. Norton">And I just want to protest absolutely that the Department 
would send us people who could get away with saying I don't 
know anything and maybe I can get back with you. And, Mr. 
Chairman, who knows whether those matters will ever be made 
public. I know you would want to make them public, but the 
hearing is over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Ms. Norton">So I'm going to cease asking Ms. Adcock any questions. 
She's having the same responses that Mr. Keckler had: We'll get 
back to you. We've been sent to respond to you, but please know 
that we know nothing, even though we are the responsible 
officials in the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Ms. Norton">    And I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I think one of the reasons why the witnesses have been 
unable to answer some of the questions is that their scope of 
responsibility is in regard to the task forces. It was not 
policy. So I think some of the questions that have been asked 
have been outside their area of expertise and outside the area 
that they're focused on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Palmer">So I think that it is inappropriate to focus on a witness' 
background instead of their subject matter. I think it's 
inappropriate to focus on things outside their area of 
expertise when they've indicated that they don't have expertise 
in that area or don't have knowledge of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I think the purpose of this hearing is to talk about the 
work of the task forces. And in that regard, I want to 
recognize myself for 5 minutes for my questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    Mr. Eitel, you said you received over 16,300 public 
comments. What would you say was the reform that was most often 
recommended?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Probably the area of civil rights and Title IX.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> Civil rights and Title IX. And then I would
assume that the task force made that a priority to address 
those areas?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> It had--yes. It was actually a personal priority
of the Secretary, given the delicate issues in play, 
particularly with the Title IX guidance that we recently 
rescinded.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Palmer">In regard to the task forces, for all three of
you, I direct this question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Palmer">When you're looking at regulations and you're looking at 
what's obsolete, what's duplicative or contradictory, are you 
also taking into consideration whether or not a program has 
been reauthorized?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    Mr. Eitel, I'll begin with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Yes. Indeed, we are in the process of
withdrawing three regulations for programs that have not been 
reauthorized by Congress.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> How about you, Ms. Adcock?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> Mr. Keckler?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> That's certainly a concern of the Department
generally. I have not heard it discussed in those terms in the 
task force.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> Okay. Sticking with you, Mr. Keckler, there are
numerous concerns raised about FDA regulations regarding access 
to new drugs. Is the task force looking at FDA regulations that 
are outdated or unnecessary that impede access to new drugs, 
particularly experimental drugs?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Yes, sir. The FDA working group has that as a
general concern and thus far has--we have worked particularly 
on looking at access to some generics in that space. But that's 
an overall concern over at the FDA.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> So you say they've been looking at it. Have
they identified any outdated or duplicative or overly 
burdensome regulations or guidance to date?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keckler</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Keckler"> Yes, sir. In my written testimony, we have
discussed briefly some of the goals here to improve the access 
to generics. FDA is reviewing how rules concerning new drugs 
are being used in ways that may create obstacles in the timely 
entry of generic competition, and they are making sure that the 
current policies aren't misused in ways that would thwart the 
competition that Congress intended when it created the modern 
generic drug framework. So that's an area where we are already 
working.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> Okay. Just in general, can you give me an idea
of how many regulations have been recommended for removal, or I 
guess you've identified regulations that you could make less 
complicated, less burdensome, Mr. Eitel?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Eitel"> Well, as I've said, we are engaging in
negotiated rulemaking on borrower defense and gainful 
employment. And the hope is that there will be a better rule 
that better protects students and also provides due process to 
institutions. That would be two primary initial examples.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Palmer"> But I hope you got more than two.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Eitel</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Eitel">We do. Those have a large impact. We are looking
at our guidance in the Office of Elementary and Secondary 
Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Eitel">    Please understand that we are--we have a duty to go through 
the comments that we've received. And we are organizing those, 
studying those, and developing priorities, based on the 
comments we receive from the public.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Well, I want to encourage you to continue to do
that. I think the task forces have done good work, and I think 
it's being conducted the way it should be conducted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    Ms. Adcock, do you have an idea of how many regulations 
that the Department of Agriculture has identified that could be 
eliminated or made less complicated?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Ms. Adcock">Our early--our first round, because we're going
at this for over a year. We've divided it up. We've identified 
probably somewhere in the area of 140 possible options, and 
then we're working through those methodically. As you know, 
there's many requirements: The APA, OMB guidelines, those sorts 
of things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Ms. Adcock">So when you identify an action that you think is likely for 
revision or deregulation, you have to go through many steps, 
including often certain requirements for, depending on where it 
is in the process, public comments and all those sorts of 
things. So those things inherently mean that you're not 
automatically deregulating, you're not automatically revising.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    We have had three to four very significant deregulatory 
actions that have been announced over the course of this summer 
up to as early as a few days ago, and there will be a 
significant number more that you will see reflected in the fall 
regulatory agenda when it is released by OMB.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Mr. Keckler, I know you guys are working on
things. I just want to emphasize that in regard to the 
Department of Agriculture and HHS, I grew up in rural northwest 
Alabama on a farm, so I really want to do what we can to 
improve the opportunities for people in rural areas, 
particularly in giving people access to healthcare. So I really 
appreciate the work that's being done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I want to emphasize that the purpose of this hearing is to 
hear from you about the progress that is being made to improve 
the ability of all Federal agencies to serve the American 
public efficiently and with the least burdensome rules and 
regulations. That's the purpose of the task forces. That's the 
purpose of these hearings, to hear a report back from you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Palmer">It has been reported that regulations cost the average 
American family $15,000 per year. That's--you know, for a 
household earning $70,000 a year, that's over 20 percent of 
their average income. It's more than they spend on practically 
everything else in their budget. This cost falls 
disproportionately on lower income households like the one I 
grew up in, which makes the work of this task force even more 
relevant and important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Palmer">And I'd like to believe that making our regulations 
effective, yet less burdensome, would be and should be a worthy 
bipartisan objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Palmer">I'd like to thank the witnesses for their testimony today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Palmer">And I remind the members of the committee the hearing 
record will remain open for 2 weeks for any member--the chair 
recognizes the ranking member Mrs. Demings for one more 
question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Mrs. Demings. Yes, just one more. Thank you so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Just a point of clarification from Ms. Adcock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Palmer">    Regarding the roster of the task force members, when did 
you submit that roster to----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Ms. Adcock"> I did not submit it. I think our Office of
Congressional Relations submitted it very recently. But we will 
make sure we get it to you----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Demings</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Ms. Demings"> Do you know----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Ms. Adcock">--the first time we have it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    Mrs. Demings. Before the hearing, though, was it submitted? 
Because I'm just receiving some conflicting information and I'm 
just trying to make sure we----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Ms. Adcock">I did not send it, so I don't want to misinform
you. But if you don't receive it, contact me personally and I 
will make sure you get it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    Mrs. Demings. So you aren't sure when it was submitted?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Adcock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Ms. Adcock">I'm not sure, no, ma'am.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Ms. Adcock">    Mrs. Demings. Okay. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Palmer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Palmer">Just for clarification, we do have that, and it
has been shared with the members of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Palmer">With that, the hearing record will remain open for 2 weeks 
for any member to submit a written opening statement or 
questions for the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Palmer">If there's no further business, without objection, the 
subcommittee stands adjourned.</paragraph>
