    <info>    The Helsinki process, formally titled the Conference on Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe, traces its origin to the signing of the </info>
    <info>Helsinki Final Act in Finland on August 1, 1975, by the leaders of 33 </info>
    <info>European countries, the United States and Canada. As of January 1, </info>
    <info>1995, the Helsinki process was renamed the Organization for Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The membership of the OSCE has </info>
    <info>expanded to 56 participating States, reflecting the breakup of the </info>
    <info>Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.</info>
    <info>    The OSCE Secretariat is in Vienna, Austria, where weekly meetings </info>
    <info>of the participating States' permanent representatives are held. In </info>
    <info>addition, specialized seminars and meetings are convened in various </info>
    <info>locations. Periodic consultations are held among Senior Officials, </info>
    <info>Ministers and Heads of State or Government.</info>
    <info>    Although the OSCE continues to engage in standard setting in the </info>
    <info>fields of military security, economic and environmental cooperation, </info>
    <info>and human rights and humanitarian concerns, the Organization is </info>
    <info>primarily focused on initiatives designed to prevent, manage and </info>
    <info>resolve conflict within and among the participating States. The </info>
    <info>Organization deploys numerous missions and field activities located in </info>
    <info>Southeastern and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The </info>
    <info>website of the OSCE is: &amp;lt;www.osce.org&amp;gt;.</info>
    <info>    The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as </info>
    <info>the Helsinki Commission, is a U.S. Government agency created in 1976 to </info>
    <info>monitor and encourage compliance by the participating States with their </info>
    <info>OSCE commitments, with a particular emphasis on human rights.</info>
    <info>    The Commission consists of nine members from the United States </info>
    <info>Senate, nine members from the House of Representatives, and one member </info>
    <info>each from the Departments of State, Defense and Commerce. The positions </info>
    <info>of Chair and Co-Chair rotate between the Senate and House every two </info>
    <info>years, when a new Congress convenes. A professional staff assists the </info>
    <info>Commissioners in their work.</info>
    <info>    In fulfilling its mandate, the Commission gathers and disseminates </info>
    <info>relevant information to the U.S. Congress and the public by convening </info>
    <info>hearings, issuing reports that reflect the views of Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission and/or its staff, and providing details about the activities </info>
    <info>of the Helsinki process and developments in OSCE participating States.</info>
    <info>    The Commission also contributes to the formulation and execution of </info>
    <info>U.S. policy regarding the OSCE, including through Member and staff </info>
    <info>participation on U.S. Delegations to OSCE meetings. Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission have regular contact with parliamentarians, government </info>
    <info>officials, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and </info>
    <info>private individuals from participating States. The website of the </info>
    <info>Commission is: &amp;lt;www.csce.gov&amp;gt;.</info>

    <info>    Mr. Parker. Good morning, everyone. My name is Kyle Parker. I'm </info>
    <info>with the U.S. Helsinki Commission. I'd like to welcome you all today to </info>
    <info>our briefing, ``A New Approach to Europe.''</info>
    <info>    Here at the Helsinki Commission we have the luxury of looking a </info>
    <info>little further ahead, going a little deeper on some of the questions </info>
    <info>that occupy the minds of the legislative branch as well as general </info>
    <info>national security questions that are confronting the United States. And </info>
    <info>one of the things, of course, in the past year or two is--there's a </info>
    <info>tension in transatlantic relations. Something has clearly changed.</info>
    <info>    I think it's fair enough to say that the relationship is in flux, </info>
    <info>maybe even strained. Look at many things that characterize this </info>
    <info>moment--the populist movements, the strong euro-skeptic threat in </info>
    <info>Europe, Brexit, fairly robust pro-NATO sentiment, real concern in the </info>
    <info>east about Moscow's intentions, concerns on Europe's southern flank </info>
    <info>with immigration, and a number of policy questions that surround that.</info>
    <info>    At the same time, I think it's fair to say that a lot remains the </info>
    <info>same, in that the United States' national security goal post-war, of a </info>
    <info>Europe that's whole, free, and at peace, remains. And so there's a </info>
    <info>question of how will we use the institutions that we participate in--</info>
    <info>namely NATO and the OSCE--to advance those goals in this context? And </info>
    <info>where does that place us vis-a-vis the EU, which, of course, we are not </info>
    <info>members of.</info>
    <info>    So in our discussion today we have a solid panel who will bring </info>
    <info>divergent viewpoints to this and hopefully raise some provocative </info>
    <info>questions. I'd just like to lay out three questions we should shed some </info>
    <info>light on. And the first one is the question of patriotism, national </info>
    <info>identity. How much does the lack of what we here in the United States </info>
    <info>would consider not simply a benign but a positive, even essential, </info>
    <info>flag-waving patriotism--how much does the lack of that in Europe </info>
    <info>contribute to the unwillingness of populaces in many of the countries </info>
    <info>to spend what is necessary to defend their own state, and meet its </info>
    <info>obvious defense needs, and also to meet their collective security </info>
    <info>obligations?</info>
    <info>    So in that sense is NATO necessarily pitted against the EU? Can </info>
    <info>NATO be aggrandized--or should NATO be aggrandized at the EU's expense, </info>
    <info>from our perspective? Our attention, understanding the moment we're in </info>
    <info>and thinking, Well, there's broad overlap between these organizations--</info>
    <info>let's shore up NATO and let the chips fall where they may on the EU? So </info>
    <info>that would be my first question.</info>
    <info>    I also would be interested in this--to what extent is the burden--</info>
    <info>it's obvious in our own domestic debate that the burden-sharing is </info>
    <info>politically important. And our current leadership has made it even more </info>
    <info>important and really highlighted it. But on a tactical and technical </info>
    <info>level how critical is it from our perspective? I think from the </info>
    <info>perspectives of the states themselves it's obvious, to be able to </info>
    <info>defend yourself. But from our perspective, how important is it that </info>
    <info>these targets are met, and met in the frame that we'd like to see them </info>
    <info>met?</info>
    <info>    And finally, let's imagine we arrive at the high-class problem </info>
    <info>where Germany spends 2 percent or more on national defense. If we were </info>
    <info>to see that, would we not have other problems in what might look like </info>
    <info>German militarization? And the fact that, with German politics in flux, </info>
    <info>we're not going to see that happen under a Chancellor Merkel. What sort </info>
    <info>of leadership would we see that happen under in Germany? And what sorts </info>
    <info>of unanticipated effects might that cause politically in neighboring </info>
    <info>states--Poland, and France, and other places?</info>
    <info>    Those are the questions I have. And without any further delay, I'm </info>
    <info>looking forward to everyone's presentation, and will turn this over to </info>
    <info>my colleague Alex to moderate our discussion.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Thank you, Kyle. Let me add my welcome to everybody </info>
    <info>here. I see a very healthy audience that we have, which I take is an </info>
    <info>excellent sign of interest in this set of topics, and certainly in our </info>
    <info>distinguished colleagues who have joined us on the panel to have this </info>
    <info>conversation.</info>
    <info>    Kyle, thank you for your intellectual leadership in laying out some </info>
    <info>of the questions that we anticipate discussing today. I would only add </info>
    <info>that the commission has a track record of kind of big thinking on a </info>
    <info>number of these issues, and certainly an engagement policy-wise on </info>
    <info>issues ranging from the security framework of Europe, to include, for </info>
    <info>instance, this briefing.</info>
    <info>    In the folders that you may have picked up, there's a resolution </info>
    <info>that was introduced by our chairman, Senator Wicker, joined by our </info>
    <info>senior Democratic Senator, Ben Cardin, and two other of our </info>
    <info>commissioners, Senators Tillis and Shaheen, who are the leaders of the </info>
    <info>Senate NATO Observers Group. They introduced together a resolution in </info>
    <info>advance of the most recent NATO summit talking about exactly these </info>
    <info>issues of transatlantic relationship and United States interests.</info>
    <info>    I would also point out that not very long ago we had an event </info>
    <info>featuring members of the European Parliament to talk about some of </info>
    <info>these questions. They were here trying to assess continued United </info>
    <info>States interest in their institution and collaboration across the </info>
    <info>Atlantic. So this, I think, fits well within the breadth of the </info>
    <info>coverage that the Helsinki Commission devotes to these questions.</info>
    <info>    So, without further ado, my role here principally is that of </info>
    <info>traffic cop. And what I would suggest that we do is, I will introduce </info>
    <info>our speakers. I'll ask them for some opening comments, in the order you </info>
    <info>see them to my left. And, dear audience, I will turn to you for </info>
    <info>questions. I will assume that you will be jotting down those questions </info>
    <info>you will have when the time comes, after I take the moderator's </info>
    <info>prerogative to push our panelists a little bit in areas in which they </info>
    <info>may agree and in areas in which they disagree.</info>
    <info>    Let me very quickly introduce the speakers I have been lauding. </info>
    <info>First, to my left, will be our first presenter, Dr. Ted Bromund. He is </info>
    <info>the senior research fellow in Anglo-American relations at the Margaret </info>
    <info>Thatcher Center for Freedom of the Heritage Foundation. To say he </info>
    <info>writes prolifically would be an understatement. He previously served as </info>
    <info>associate director of international security studies at Yale. And we've </info>
    <info>asked him to offer us a broad-strokes overview of United States </info>
    <info>relations with Europe in a historical context, as well as thinking hard </info>
    <info>about what the European Union's role is as a security provider in its </info>
    <info>own region today.</info>
    <info>    Our second presenter will be Dr. Paul Coyer of the Institute of </info>
    <info>World Politics. He'll be offering his thoughts on the nature of </info>
    <info>nationalism in Europe today, that's been alluded to already, and the </info>
    <info>implications of some of these trends on transatlantic relations. Dr. </info>
    <info>Coyer, who is a historian, is a contributor to Forbes magazine and a </info>
    <info>contributing editor of Providence, a journal of Christianity and </info>
    <info>American foreign policy. Of course, we're always also happy to welcome </info>
    <info>back a former Hill staffer.</info>
    <info>    Last, we will hear from Jeff Rathke, who serves as president of the </info>
    <info>American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at the Johns Hopkins </info>
    <info>University. Jeff, congratulations, again, on that still relatively </info>
    <info>recent appointment. I think they selected a terrific candidate. Prior </info>
    <info>to joining the institute, Jeff was the senior fellow and deputy </info>
    <info>director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and </info>
    <info>International Studies (CSIS). He joined CSIS in 2015 from an extremely </info>
    <info>distinguished career at the Department of State, where he served as a </info>
    <info>foreign service officer for 24 years. And in that distinguished career, </info>
    <info>he was primarily dedicated to U.S. relations with Europe, including </info>
    <info>stints at NATO headquarters.</info>
    <info>    So three very different backgrounds to assess this set of </info>
    <info>questions. I'm looking forward to their presentations. Ted, please </info>
    <info>start us off.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Bromund. Thanks very much. Real pleasure to be here. And I want </info>
    <info>to start off by thanking Alex Tiersky and Kyle Parker for conceiving of </info>
    <info>and organizing this briefing. It's an important subject, because U.S. </info>
    <info>policy toward Europe has changed fundamentally since 1945, and in </info>
    <info>particular since 1989. But in my view, the shifts in U.S. policy have </info>
    <info>not been well considered or well understood, in part because most of </info>
    <info>the relevant scholars, policymakers, and funding derive from a single </info>
    <info>perspective--that of the European Union.</info>
    <info>    So in my view, the U.S. does not need a new policy toward Europe. </info>
    <info>It already has a new policy toward Europe. And it's had a new policy </info>
    <info>toward Europe since the end of the cold war. It needs to return to its </info>
    <info>former policy, from which it has thoughtlessly strayed. Inevitably, </info>
    <info>this briefing, like any discussion of Europe, raises the question of </info>
    <info>populism. I'm not entirely sure what is meant by the term populism, </info>
    <info>except that it is obviously used to describe parties, movements, and </info>
    <info>beliefs that the speaker dislikes. It is a negative term.</info>
    <info>    At the level of politics, what is happening is that in many </info>
    <info>European nations--except for Britain, interestingly--established </info>
    <info>parties on the left in particular, but also on the right, are losing </info>
    <info>votes to new parties which are often described as populist or </info>
    <info>nationalist. It's important to understand why this is happening. I've </info>
    <info>been struck over the past several years by the relatively uncurious </info>
    <info>approach that's been taken toward the rise of the new parties and the </info>
    <info>decline of the old ones. The phenomena, in my view, is condemned more </info>
    <info>often than it is analyzed.</info>
    <info>    Sometimes the explanation that's offered is that it's all the fault </info>
    <info>of the Russians. I have been a vehement opponent of the Russian regime, </info>
    <info>and a great many pieces on it published, but in my view blaming the </info>
    <info>Russians is so simplistic an explanation that it barely merits a </info>
    <info>rebuttal. It should be obvious that when large numbers of people vote </info>
    <info>for new parties, they are doing so because the old parties do not meet </info>
    <info>their needs. If lots of people did not vote for the new parties, there </info>
    <info>would be no rise of populism to worry about. It should be equally </info>
    <info>obvious that the old consensus and the analytic and policy support for </info>
    <info>it from the U.S. are equally faulty. After all, if that consensus had </info>
    <info>been genuinely satisfactory, it would be now receiving more support </info>
    <info>from the European publics.</info>
    <info>    One problem is the relative narrowness of the political consensus </info>
    <info>in Europe. You don't have to go very far on the left, or especially on </info>
    <info>the right, before you fall outside the European political consensus. In </info>
    <info>these circumstances, anyone who disagrees with a substantial part of </info>
    <info>that consensus is going to have to look for a new party to vote for. </info>
    <info>And given that support for the European Union and for ever-deeper </info>
    <info>integration are a core part of the elite European political consensus, </info>
    <info>it's inevitable that a good deal of the rebellion against it is going </info>
    <info>to be associated with nationalism.</info>
    <info>    Now, nationalism is a dirty word in Europe. That's because </info>
    <info>nationalism has been tarred by association with Nazism. Precisely why </info>
    <info>Adolf Hitler, who was a racist imperialist, is now regarded as a </info>
    <info>nationalist, while the nationalists in Poland, France, and Britain who </info>
    <info>resisted Hitler and fought to restore or save their political </info>
    <info>independence are treated as the heroes of Europe's anti-nationalist </info>
    <info>rebirth is an interesting question. But the broader fact is this: Every </info>
    <info>single stable democracy in the world--every one of them--grew out of a </info>
    <info>national state and was fortified by a sense of nationalism. Without </info>
    <info>nationalism, there is no political community, and without political </info>
    <info>community there can be no democracy.</info>
    <info>    This is not an original idea on my part. Philosophers from Adam </info>
    <info>Smith to John Stuart Mill regarded what I have just said as an absolute </info>
    <info>commonplace. Historians of almost every European nation--I'm thinking </info>
    <info>of my first advisor at Yale, Linda Colley, who wrote about Britain, to </info>
    <info>the distinguished historian of France, Eugene Weber--have pointed out </info>
    <info>the importance of a felt sense of national identity to the making of a </info>
    <info>political nation--all of these historians have also pointed out </info>
    <info>something else. National identity is not inherent. Babies are not born </info>
    <info>French or Polish. National identity is learned and constructed. In </info>
    <info>other words, you do not just--in Eugene Weber's phrase--make peasants </info>
    <info>into Frenchmen once. You have to do it every generation.</info>
    <info>    And you have to do it with immigrants, too. Too many in Europe </info>
    <info>believe that Europe can rest forever on the nation-making achievements </info>
    <info>of past generations, or even that it should degrade those achievements </info>
    <info>by denigrating nationalism for the sake of a shallowly rooted </info>
    <info>Europeanism. This is a fundamental error. Nations are not made forever. </info>
    <info>And if they are not being continuously remade, they are being </info>
    <info>destroyed.</info>
    <info>    I would not, myself, say that nationalism is a good thing. Like any </info>
    <info>kind of group identity, it offends against God's truth that we are all </info>
    <info>individuals. Nor would I say that all nationalism in Europe will </info>
    <info>necessarily be for the best. You cannot spend 70 years equating </info>
    <info>nationalism with illiberalism and Adolf Hitler and then be shocked that </info>
    <info>the belief that you have demonized is represented at times by </info>
    <info>illiberals. Europe has made its bed and it's going to have to lie in </info>
    <info>it. If liberals do not own nationalism, it will inevitably become the </info>
    <info>property of illiberals.</info>
    <info>    But I would say that nationalism is a necessary thing, and that if </info>
    <info>you don't have it or if you try to repress it, its space will be filled </info>
    <info>by other kinds of group identities that are fundamentally incompatible </info>
    <info>with democracy. In other words, I regard nationalism as an important </info>
    <info>and necessary force. I disagree with those who argue that nationalism </info>
    <info>was responsible for Europe's fall. I agree, instead, with Adam Smith; </info>
    <info>Europe rose because it was divided into competing units. Nationalism as </info>
    <info>the cause of Europe's rise, not Europe's fall.</info>
    <info>    So part of the reason for the rise of populism in Europe is that a </info>
    <info>narrow and anti-national elite political consensus left no space for </info>
    <info>nationalism. Nationalism has therefore made its own space. But this is </info>
    <info>only part of what's going on. Another part are specific policy errors </info>
    <info>that Europe has made and that the U.S. has, especially since the end of </info>
    <info>the cold war, indulged and supported. If we go back to the immediate </info>
    <info>post-1945 years, we will see that the U.S. approach to stabilizing and </info>
    <info>democratizing Europe, or at least Western Europe, rested heavily on the </info>
    <info>belief that democracy cannot exist without reasonably high and steady </info>
    <info>levels of economic growth. At the least, there can be no Great </info>
    <info>Depressions.</info>
    <info>    Thus, all of the U.S. initiatives in post-war Europe--from the </info>
    <info>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development--we now call it the </info>
    <info>World Bank--to the IMF, to the Marshall Plan, to the GATT--it's now the </info>
    <info>World Trade Organization--and, yes, even NATO--were fundamentally </info>
    <info>economic. This belief drew on a diagnosis about the causes of the rise </info>
    <info>of the Nazis and the origins of the Second World War, which was </info>
    <info>fundamentally liberal. The resulting, largely liberal, strategy was </info>
    <info>well informed and extremely successful.</info>
    <info>    If I had to sum up that post-1945 U.S. strategy, it was to make </info>
    <info>economic changes to preserve the political order. What do we do now? We </info>
    <info>do precisely the opposite. The apple of the EU's eye is the euro, </info>
    <info>which, as the Obama administration agreed during the euro crisis, must </info>
    <info>be preserved at all costs. The EU therefore pushes the forces of change </info>
    <info>away from its economic system and into the political systems of its </info>
    <info>member nations--such as Greece and now Italy. And the U.S. supports the </info>
    <info>EU in this error. We now prioritize economics over politics. After </info>
    <info>1945, we did precisely the reverse.</info>
    <info>    The EU likes to boast that the European economic model is different </info>
    <info>from that of the United States. By this, the EU means that the European </info>
    <info>model is low growth. And the EU regards that as a good thing, </info>
    <info>regardless of how much youth unemployment it leads to in Spain. But it </info>
    <info>is worse than that. With the EU's approach to Brexit and, for example, </info>
    <info>its impending copyright law, the EU has reached the stage where it </info>
    <info>simply tries to chain the other guy down or make as much money as </info>
    <info>possible by suing him. In other words, the EU does not just back a low-</info>
    <info>growth model, it has abandoned its hopes of becoming a leading digital </info>
    <info>online power and is now much more interested in trying to insulate its </info>
    <info>low-growth model by reducing growth elsewhere.</info>
    <info>    Of course, I would be the first to admit that Europe's growth </info>
    <info>problem is not all the EU's fault. All over Europe, and indeed in the </info>
    <info>United States, national policies mirror and exacerbate the EU's </info>
    <info>policies. But virtually everyone recognizes that, just as the EU </info>
    <info>claims, the EU and European economic models value social protection </info>
    <info>over growth. But at some point--and we are well past that point--Europe </info>
    <info>needs to emphasize growth, for the same reason that it needed growth </info>
    <info>after 1945. Democracies cannot tolerate persistently high levels of </info>
    <info>unemployment. It is a sure bet that voting publics will react to low </info>
    <info>growth and high unemployment somehow, likely by blaming the parties in </info>
    <info>power and voting for new ones.</info>
    <info>    The first major error we have made is, therefore, economic. The </info>
    <info>second major error we and Europe have made is to neglect security. More </info>
    <info>specifically, the U.S. has sought to outsource the responsibility for </info>
    <info>European security to the Europeans and the EU. This is the culmination </info>
    <info>of a long-held American wish, one expressed almost as vehemently by </info>
    <info>President Eisenhower as was it was by Presidents Obama or Trump. But no </info>
    <info>matter how long or how vehemently we wish for this, it will not work </info>
    <info>because the Europeans and, in particular the EU, lack the willingness </info>
    <info>to provide for their own security. I regret this, but I see no point in </info>
    <info>kidding ourselves.</info>
    <info>    The threats to European security today come from two quarters: </info>
    <info>Russia and the Mediterranean. The European response to the Russian </info>
    <info>invasion and dismemberment of Ukraine has been a set of modest and </info>
    <info>largely symbolic sanctions and, except for the NATO member states that </info>
    <info>border on Russia, no meaningful increases in defense spending at all. </info>
    <info>In other words, an absolute and complete failure to respond in any </info>
    <info>significant way whatsoever. In the Mediterranean, Chancellor Merkel, in </info>
    <info>line with Germany's dual role as America's worst ally and Europe's most </info>
    <info>selfish power, adopted a cataclysmically irresponsible open borders </info>
    <info>policy, a policy which rested on no consultations at all and which </info>
    <info>embodied nothing more than a politically foolhardy sense of guilt.</info>
    <info>    But the problem is deeper than that. Americans are remarkably </info>
    <info>gullible in their acceptance of the belief that the EU is our friend </info>
    <info>and are equally and remarkably unwilling to overlook repeated EU </info>
    <info>statements that it views the U.S. as a rival. As EU President Donald </info>
    <info>Tusk put it in early 2017, quote, ``It must be made crystal clear that </info>
    <info>the disintegration of the EU will not lead to the restoration of some </info>
    <info>mythical, full sovereignty of its member states, but to their real and </info>
    <info>factual dependence on the great superpowers: the United States, Russia </info>
    <info>and China. Only together can we be fully independent.'' Close quote.</info>
    <info>    The point of this is, indeed, crystal clear. President Tusk classes </info>
    <info>the United States with Russia and China. I suggest we take him at his </info>
    <info>word and treat him with as much consideration as he treats us. It is </info>
    <info>time for us to recognize that the EU is an open and declared enemy to </info>
    <info>the role that the U.S. assumed in Europe after 1945. At the EU level, </info>
    <info>the fundamental problem, the reason why the EU takes this approach, is </info>
    <info>that for the EU everything is political. The point of EU defense </info>
    <info>initiatives is not to improve Europe's defenses. It is to reduce the </info>
    <info>defense sovereignty of EU's nation-states, and to diminish NATO in </info>
    <info>general, and particularly the American role in the defense of Europe.</info>
    <info>    The point of the euro is not to make the European economies work </info>
    <info>better. It is a political instrument for European unity. The point of </info>
    <info>having an EU foreign policy, or a border force, is not to do these </info>
    <info>things better. It is to elevate Brussels and reduce the role of the </info>
    <info>nation-states of Europe. This strategy has been remarkably successful </info>
    <info>on its own terms, but it neglects one key point. Strategy, security, </info>
    <info>the economy, the border, foreign policy--all of these things are issues </info>
    <info>with realities of their own. By treating them merely as political </info>
    <info>instruments for the greatness of the European Union, the EU shows it </info>
    <info>prefers a show of greatness to the reality of achievement in any of </info>
    <info>these areas.</info>
    <info>    At the level of national politics, the rise of populism is </info>
    <info>therefore not surprising. If you are an established political party in </info>
    <info>a democratic political system that offers little meaningful choice, I </info>
    <info>would suggest that an approach which combines low growth, low levels of </info>
    <info>job creation, high levels of unskilled migration, increasing levels of </info>
    <info>supranational control, a rejection of the assimilative force of </info>
    <info>national identity, and lashings of deeply felt guilt are unlikely to </info>
    <info>increase your vote share with the public. If you want to provoke people </info>
    <info>into voting against you, however, all of these things make up an </info>
    <info>excellent strategy.</info>
    <info>    That is the path that Europe has followed. And it is the path that </info>
    <info>the U.S. has endorsed and enabled. This path is a foolhardy one. The </info>
    <info>problem is that we are now so far down it that backing out will be </info>
    <info>extremely difficult. In too many European countries, there are too few </info>
    <info>credible voices outside the consensus who can lead a move away from it </info>
    <info>and move back to a path of sovereign national democracies, a restored </info>
    <info>balance between social protection and economic growth, and a </info>
    <info>transatlantic security alliance that rests on controlled borders and </info>
    <info>credible deterrence against the Russians. But that is the right path </info>
    <info>for us to follow, nonetheless.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Ted, thanks for that. You put a lot on the plate--</info>
    <info>questions of the proper understanding of nationalism, the role of </info>
    <info>growth. You've tied together economics and the strategic plane to </info>
    <info>politics in a very compelling way.</info>
    <info>    Let me immediately pass the floor to Paul for his remarks.</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Coyer. Thank you. I'm going to address the issue of nationalism </info>
    <info>and national identity as well. I'm going to leave out much of what Ted </info>
    <info>said--actually, I have a chapter coming out in a publication from </info>
    <info>National Defense University Press next month. That's coming out of a </info>
    <info>conference at which I gave a keynote in August. So I agree with Ted's </info>
    <info>take on that.</info>
    <info>    Ted and I are both historians, so I want to take a bit of a </info>
    <info>historical perspective to start with. This is November 2018. Can any of </info>
    <info>you remember 100 years ago what happened? [audience comment] Not </info>
    <info>Versailles, the armistice. So you were on the right track. In 10 days, </info>
    <info>we will be observing the hundredth anniversary of the ending of the </info>
    <info>First World War, a war which has been blamed, to a large degree, on the </info>
    <info>passions of nationalism, just as the war that followed that would be. </info>
    <info>And today, we see debate over the virtues and vices of national </info>
    <info>identity, national sovereignty, and the nation-state vis-a-vis growth </info>
    <info>and the importance of supranational institutions and more global </info>
    <info>governance that is strikingly similar, in many ways, to that which </info>
    <info>occurred in the aftermath of the Great War.</info>
    <info>    The Brexit vote, the election of Donald Trump here in the United </info>
    <info>States, and the surge of what has been referred to in a pejorative </info>
    <info>manner as populist and nationalist movements throughout the West are </info>
    <info>only the opening salvos of what I am convinced will be a mammoth </info>
    <info>struggle over ideas regarding national identity versus cosmopolitanism, </info>
    <info>more local national governments versus transnational government </info>
    <info>institutions, the importance of identity in general, and the impact </info>
    <info>that those ideas will have on the shape of the international order.</info>
    <info>    It is conflicting attitudes toward these ideas, more than anything </info>
    <info>else, that in my view is the cause of the disconnect that we see </info>
    <info>currently between President Trump and many Western European leaders. A </info>
    <info>group of European scholars have argued in an essay last year regarding </info>
    <info>the EU that the originally envisioned European integration project has </info>
    <info>become overtaken by a secularizing, progressive ideological agenda, at </info>
    <info>odds with the project envisioned by many of the EU's founders, which </info>
    <info>vision was more grounded in Europe's Christian and classical cultural </info>
    <info>roots, and which gave room to distinctive national and regional </info>
    <info>identities. According to these scholars, the project was conceived and </info>
    <info>initiated in a very different cultural ecology than that which exists </info>
    <info>among Europe's ruling class today.</info>
    <info>    They point to Christianity and Europe's classical heritage as being </info>
    <info>the foundation of European culture, arguing that as that cultural </info>
    <info>foundation has eroded, quote, ``the loss of that cultural horizon in </info>
    <info>the process of European integration after the Second World War can be </info>
    <info>explained by the secularization of European societies and by the turn </info>
    <info>away from classical values in favor of the technocratic, progressive </info>
    <info>agenda of scientifically informed societal management.'' One of the </info>
    <info>things that Alex didn't mention from my bio is that I'm an associate </info>
    <info>professor at the French Army's version of West Point. And I get a </info>
    <info>first-hand view in France of this struggle within Europe and among </info>
    <info>themselves over these sorts of values.</info>
    <info>    To a large degree, the scholars I just referenced that wrote that </info>
    <info>paper last year blame this cultural shift I've described, and they </info>
    <info>described, and the divergence of attitude between the EU's ruling </info>
    <info>elites and vast swaths of European citizenry toward fundamental issues </info>
    <info>such as tradition and the importance of national identity and </info>
    <info>sovereignty for the position within which the EU finds itself today, in </info>
    <info>which the foundations of political and popular support for the EU </info>
    <info>project and European integration are increasingly shaky. Along with </info>
    <info>these authors, I believe that a renewed emphasis on the importance of a </info>
    <info>healthy nationalism does not require a retreat from European </info>
    <info>integration, so long as that integration is reconceived to be more in </info>
    <info>line with the vision of its founders, rather than reflective of the </info>
    <info>progressive agenda that has come to dominate it.</info>
    <info>    The United States certainly needs a strong, unified, reliable, and </info>
    <info>prosperous, and democratic partner on the other side of the Atlantic. </info>
    <info>And European integration can play a key role in ensuring that that type </info>
    <info>of partnership exists and continues to exist, so long as the European </info>
    <info>project gives more space to such issues as tradition, identity, and </info>
    <info>national sovereignty. Unless it does so, the bases of its popular </info>
    <info>support will continue to be threatened, and the disconnect between the </info>
    <info>EU's elites and vast swaths of European citizenry over these issues is </info>
    <info>going to increasingly threaten the future of the whole political </info>
    <info>project.</info>
    <info>    In the context of highly contested visions during the 1980s of the </info>
    <info>form that should be taken by the emerging European Union at the time, </info>
    <info>then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned European leaders </info>
    <info>against their current course in her famous speech in September 1988 in </info>
    <info>Bruges. She said, quote, ``To try to suppress nationhood and </info>
    <info>concentrate power at the center of a European conglomerate would be </info>
    <info>highly damaging and would jeopardize the objectives we seek to achieve. </info>
    <info>Europe will be stronger precisely because it has France as France, </info>
    <info>Spain as Spain, Britain as Britain, each with its own customs, </info>
    <info>traditions, and identity. It would be folly to try to fit them into </info>
    <info>some sort of identikit European personality.''</info>
    <info>    ``Indeed, it is ironic,'' she went on, ``that just when those </info>
    <info>countries such as the Soviet Union, which have tried to run everything </info>
    <info>from the center, are learning that success depends on dispersing power </info>
    <info>and decisions away from the center, there are some in the community who </info>
    <info>seem to want to move in the opposite direction. We have not </info>
    <info>successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to </info>
    <info>see them re-imposed at a European level with a European super-state </info>
    <info>exercising a new dominance from Brussels. Certainly we want to see a </info>
    <info>Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose. But it </info>
    <info>must be in a way that preserves the different traditions, parliamentary </info>
    <info>powers, and sense of national pride in one's own country; for these </info>
    <info>have been the source of Europe's vitality through the centuries.''</info>
    <info>    That vision that Prime Minister Thatcher gave of European </info>
    <info>integration, rather than one in which the principle of solidarity is </info>
    <info>given only lip service, decisionmaking authority becomes increasingly </info>
    <info>distant from and unaccountable to the European grassroots, and </info>
    <info>attachment to traditional sovereignty and national identity are </info>
    <info>disdained, is one that would address the concerns of those within </info>
    <info>Europe who have been leading the charge against the EU as it is now </info>
    <info>constructed and conceived, and would strengthen the space of popular </info>
    <info>support among Europe's citizenry.</info>
    <info>    It would also help with the geopolitical challenge posed by Russia, </info>
    <info>in my view. Like Ted, I have written quite a bit on Russia for Forbes </info>
    <info>and other publications. I have had my share of troll attacks. The </info>
    <info>Russians have selected me; I will not fly Aeroflot anytime soon. But </info>
    <info>like Ted, I have to say that it is absurd, I think, to put it bluntly, </info>
    <info>to blame everything that's happening in Europe, the rise of what are </info>
    <info>called populist and nationalist parties, on Russia. However, Vladimir </info>
    <info>Putin has quite shrewdly played upon the sense among large portions of </info>
    <info>the West that its leaders no longer share their appreciation of the </info>
    <info>importance of faith, family, tradition, and national identity. He has </info>
    <info>played on this theme in order to increase his soft power appeal </info>
    <info>throughout major segments of the West, while at the same time to create </info>
    <info>a positive brand for Russia, whose reputation has, to put it mildly, </info>
    <info>taken quite a hit in the past few years, and which has been therefore </info>
    <info>in desperate need of rebranding.</info>
    <info>    The Kremlin's skillful propaganda in this regard, which has been </info>
    <info>interwoven with its propaganda regarding the West turning hostile to </info>
    <info>its Christian civilizational roots, the implication, of course, being </info>
    <info>that Russia remains traditional and Christian, has found broad </info>
    <info>resonance within Europe and much of the rest of the world, despite the </info>
    <info>obvious fact that Vladimir Putin is hardly a paragon of Christian </info>
    <info>virtue, nor an exemplar of ethical Christian leadership.</info>
    <info>    Early in President Trump's presidency, Guy Verhofstadt, the EU </info>
    <info>Parliament's Brexit negotiator and former Belgian prime minister, gave </info>
    <info>a speech in London in which he said that Europe faces a threat from </info>
    <info>Donald Trump. EU leaders also uniformly speak about how national </info>
    <info>identity is also a threat, using pejorative language and portraying it </info>
    <info>as a uniformly dark and fascist force.</info>
    <info>    Many Europeans, however, see national identity, sovereignty, and </info>
    <info>tradition as a moral good, and are therefore much more in line with </info>
    <info>President Trump's thinking in this area than they are with the take of </info>
    <info>the EU leaders, that see supranational institutions and the diminution </info>
    <info>of national identity and national loyalties as necessary for peace and </info>
    <info>prosperity in Europe. Increasingly, the United States and many of our </info>
    <info>Western allies are being led by those to which the late Samuel </info>
    <info>Huntington, in his 2004 essay, ``Dead Souls,'' a phrase borrowed from a </info>
    <info>Sir Walter Scott poem of the same name, referred to as a, quote </info>
    <info>``denationalized elite who have forgotten the mystic cords of memory, </info>
    <info>while the American people have not.'' He was referring to the American </info>
    <info>context when he wrote this.</info>
    <info>    The deep divide within Europe on the issues of tradition, </info>
    <info>sovereignty, and national identity and what constitutes Europe's </info>
    <info>historic cultural values is one reason why these issues need much more </info>
    <info>reflective and nuanced attention than, for the most part, they have </info>
    <info>been receiving from EU's ruling class. The restoration of a sense of </info>
    <info>solidarity between these leaders in the West and our citizenry is </info>
    <info>necessary to the future of liberal democracy. Unless this large gap in </info>
    <info>perceptions between European elites and much of the European citizenry </info>
    <info>is addressed, not only will it continue to see the disintegration of </info>
    <info>the political bases of support for the European project, but the </info>
    <info>Kremlin will continue to have an open opportunity to continue to </info>
    <info>increase its influence and standing within our own political </info>
    <info>constituencies, to the detriment of us all.</info>
    <info>    The value and importance of transatlantic ties is not in question, </info>
    <info>despite some of President Trump's rhetoric that has caused heartburn. </info>
    <info>Whether U.S.-European relations are headed off a cliff, as some </info>
    <info>suppose, depends upon which Europe one is talking about: the Europe </info>
    <info>envisioned and espoused by European leaders of today in which a </info>
    <info>centralized authority, increasingly divorced from much of the people it </info>
    <info>governs in terms of its governing philosophy and aspirations, or the </info>
    <info>traditional Europe we see arising in opposition to the EU's leaders, in </info>
    <info>which European cooperation is to be based upon sovereign, independent </info>
    <info>nation-states cooperating because it is in their national interest to </info>
    <info>do so.</info>
    <info>    A similar debate over all these issues--one that reflects starkly </info>
    <info>differing worldviews--is taking place both within Europe and here in </info>
    <info>the United States. And it is the outcome of this debate on both sides </info>
    <info>of the Atlantic that will determine the nature and shape of the </info>
    <info>transatlantic relationship going forward.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Thanks, Paul. I take away a number of things from your </info>
    <info>presentation. Your description of a European integration that, while it </info>
    <info>has its challenges, in your view, need not necessarily be in retreat. A </info>
    <info>united Europe can play a key role as a partner to the United States, </info>
    <info>but under specific circumstances and not based on an identikit </info>
    <info>strategy. I also take away your description of Putin being able to play </info>
    <info>on the differences between the elites and the citizenships--the elites </info>
    <info>who--you referenced Samuel Huntington's ``Dead Souls.''</info>
    <info>    Let me pass over now to Jeff Rathke for his views before I engage </info>
    <info>you all in responding to some of those points.</info>
    <info>    Thanks.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Rathke. Thanks, Alex. Thanks also Kyle Parker, and to everyone </info>
    <info>associated with the Helsinki Commission. And I want to recognize at the </info>
    <info>start the important work that the commission does, and my appreciation </info>
    <info>for the invitation. I also want to thank those who are here, who made </info>
    <info>the effort to come in person, but also those who are watching online.</info>
    <info>    I'm speaking today on the one hand as president of the American </info>
    <info>Institute for Contemporary German Studies, but also as someone who </info>
    <info>served as a diplomat for a long time in Republican and Democratic </info>
    <info>administrations and worked mainly on U.S. relations with Europe--both </info>
    <info>political relations as well as defense and security.</info>
    <info>    So an important question brings us here today--whether the United </info>
    <info>States needs a new approach to Europe. I have to say, I've heard </info>
    <info>relatively little about what the new approach should be thus far, so I </info>
    <info>want to try to contribute a bit to that. It is unquestionably true that </info>
    <info>the international landscape in security terms, in economic terms, and </info>
    <info>in political terms has been changing for quite a few years.</info>
    <info>    The United States and its allies face a revanchist Russia that </info>
    <info>attempts to alter borders by force in Europe, and also seeks to exploit </info>
    <info>the social and political vulnerabilities in our societies, to weaken </info>
    <info>our cohesion, and to undermine our democracies. I would agree with both </info>
    <info>the previous speakers that Russia does not create those </info>
    <info>vulnerabilities. It does seek to exploit them, sometimes with success. </info>
    <info>And so that is something we need to be vigilant about, even as we </info>
    <info>recognize that the divisions they exploit are largely of our own making </info>
    <info>and not of Russia's creation.</info>
    <info>    Beyond Russia, we have the challenge from China expanding its </info>
    <info>international influence and its ability to project economic, political, </info>
    <info>and military power not only in the Asia-Pacific but also in Europe, </info>
    <info>which is a challenge to the international order. Proliferation of </info>
    <info>nuclear and missile technology in North Korea and Iran is a pressing </info>
    <info>concern. And international terrorism is an important threat. These </info>
    <info>geopolitical factors, I believe, are correctly diagnosed in the </info>
    <info>administration's national security strategy.</info>
    <info>    Now, turning more particularly to Europe, which is the topic of </info>
    <info>discussion today, there has been a rise--regardless of how you want to </info>
    <info>characterize it--of nationalist or of anti-establishment political </info>
    <info>forces inside Europe over many years. And it has spread over time </info>
    <info>across much of the European continent. This is altering the internal </info>
    <info>politics in European countries. It's affecting the dynamics within the </info>
    <info>European Union. And it's affecting the relations among European states. </info>
    <info>Brexit is one example, perhaps the most prominent. But there are </info>
    <info>others.</info>
    <info>    So the question for this panel, as I understand it, concerns U.S. </info>
    <info>policy toward Europe. Now, for seven decades the U.S. has had a </info>
    <info>remarkably consistent approach to Europe, I would argue, promoting a </info>
    <info>stronger and more integrated Europe so that it can play the role of a </info>
    <info>partner to the United States in transatlantic security, in shaping the </info>
    <info>global economy, and in responding to international foreign policy and </info>
    <info>security challenges.</info>
    <info>    Now, that's not to say we haven't had disagreements with Europe on </info>
    <info>many issues over the decades. There have been some quite serious ones. </info>
    <info>But on just about any major international problem that the United </info>
    <info>States has to confront and has tried to confront--whether by Republican </info>
    <info>or Democratic administrations--the United States has inevitably sought </info>
    <info>the partnership and support of European countries in that endeavor. </info>
    <info>That's true of military operations, such as the wars in Iraq and </info>
    <info>Afghanistan, the fight to eliminate the so-called Islamic State, the </info>
    <info>intervention in Libya, and the wars in the Balkans, if you go back </info>
    <info>farther.</info>
    <info>    When it comes to the economic relationship, the ties across the </info>
    <info>Atlantic are the most intense and important trade and investment </info>
    <info>relationship in the world. One trillion dollars annually in two-way </info>
    <info>trade, 5 trillion [dollars] in mutual investments. The U.S. and Europe </info>
    <info>have sought over the years to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, </info>
    <info>because they realize that the potential gains to the transatlantic </info>
    <info>economy are enormous given the breadth of our relationship. Now, those </info>
    <info>negotiations have not always succeeded. And there's certainly much more </info>
    <info>to be done.</info>
    <info>    The United States also works together with Europe to fight </info>
    <info>proliferation, to counter terrorism, to advance democracy and human </info>
    <info>rights, and to promote international norms and standards that favor </info>
    <info>freedom and the rule of law.</info>
    <info>    Now, sometimes there is an element of nostalgia that comes with </info>
    <info>discussion of the transatlantic relationship. I think both previous </info>
    <info>speakers have tried to avoid that, and I appreciate that, because, you </info>
    <info>know, while the U.S. security alliance with Europe brought about what I </info>
    <info>would argue is the most monumental success of the late 20th century--</info>
    <info>the triumph of democracy and liberty in the standoff with the Soviet </info>
    <info>empire--sentimentality is not a guide for the policy choices that we </info>
    <info>face today and for the future.</info>
    <info>    So another way of formulating the question might be this: Do the </info>
    <info>changes in the international environment in recent years mean that the </info>
    <info>transatlantic instincts that leaders of both parties have cultivated </info>
    <info>since the end of the Second World War are no longer valid? I would </info>
    <info>contend that the logic behind those instincts is as compelling as ever. </info>
    <info>When you look across the Atlantic, the United States finds the largest </info>
    <info>collection of economically advanced, militarily capable, and </info>
    <info>politically like-minded countries, that are prepared to take political </info>
    <info>risks and stand with the United States in confronting a challenge. </info>
    <info>European countries and institutions like NATO and the European Union </info>
    <info>are our partners of first resort. And it is clear that the United </info>
    <info>States benefits from and should seek partnership with Europe, unless we </info>
    <info>choose to deliberately do things alone, which is a choice.</info>
    <info>    Now, getting to the policy differences that we have with some of </info>
    <info>our European friends and partners, those could be reasonably be raised </info>
    <info>as an objection. The Nord Stream II gas pipeline is one example. But I </info>
    <info>believe that an effective foreign policy for the United States is one </info>
    <info>that seeks to establish priorities that are achievable within the </info>
    <info>resources that we have available to us. And if we look at the world </info>
    <info>through a lens of great power competition, as I believe this </info>
    <info>administration does, in which there are five crucial challenges--</info>
    <info>Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and international terrorism--U.S. </info>
    <info>success in meeting any of those challenges will be greatly enhanced by </info>
    <info>partnership with Europe.</info>
    <info>    Economically, it is hard to see the European Union as a greater </info>
    <info>challenge than China, for example, and to portray the European Union as </info>
    <info>a foe is, frankly, absurd. The United States and the EU together </info>
    <info>account for 46 percent of global GDP. Our influence is enormous </info>
    <info>together on global economic issues. Alone, the United States is 24 </info>
    <info>percent of global GDP, and necessarily wields less influence in trying </info>
    <info>to shape the future of the global economy than we would in partnership </info>
    <info>with Europe.</info>
    <info>    I would remind you that the majority of U.S. foreign investment is </info>
    <info>in Europe. Fifty-eight percent of our foreign investment is in Europe. </info>
    <info>And Europe is the largest source of foreign investment in this country. </info>
    <info>Sixty-nine percent of foreign investment in the U.S. comes from Europe. </info>
    <info>So I think it is not particularly helpful to U.S. policy formulation to </info>
    <info>demonize the countries that share the most with us in terms of their </info>
    <info>economic models, their democratic values, and their willingness to take </info>
    <info>actions beyond their own borders to achieve common goals.</info>
    <info>    Now, it's a separate question whether the changing politics inside </info>
    <info>Europe means that these partners should be somehow less attractive. If </info>
    <info>you look at European foreign policy, which is a complicated mix of </info>
    <info>national policies and policies coordinated at the EU level, let's look </info>
    <info>at European Union sanctions on Russia, for example. Those were adopted </info>
    <info>as an EU policy by consensus. And they have held since Russia's </info>
    <info>invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Now, if we raise the question of whether </info>
    <info>we would have a more effective European response if it were not </info>
    <info>coordinated at the European Union level, I think the answer is obvious.</info>
    <info>    And it becomes even more obvious now when you look at the number of </info>
    <info>countries that want the European Union to end its sanctions on Russia, </info>
    <info>because they don't want to make that economic sacrifice anymore. Is it </info>
    <info>in the United States' interest to have effective sanctions against </info>
    <info>Russia or not? If the answer is yes, and I believe it is, then working </info>
    <info>with the European Union is the way to accomplish that. Working with not </info>
    <info>only leaders of the European Union--that is, the European Commission </info>
    <info>and the European Council--but with the leaders of European Union member </info>
    <info>states. I think previous speakers have both pointed out that the </info>
    <info>national leaders remain important. And I would argue that they remain </info>
    <info>the most important factors in European decisionmaking, especially on </info>
    <info>crucial foreign policy issues. There is no Europe that is driven--in </info>
    <info>crucial foreign policy issues--by faceless bureaucrats in Brussels or </info>
    <info>by the European Parliament. It is the engagement and the priority-</info>
    <info>setting of the national leaders in the European Union that are </info>
    <info>ultimately decisive.</info>
    <info>    And I would say that we see the European Union is able to act in </info>
    <info>unison, despite the sometimes fractious politics within Europe. Let's </info>
    <info>look at one example, which is the retaliatory tariffs that the European </info>
    <info>Union imposed on the United States after the United States imposed </info>
    <info>national-security-based tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from </info>
    <info>the European Union. Now, it's a separate question whether there's </info>
    <info>really a national security basis for those kinds of sanctions, but I </info>
    <info>think it belies the suggestion that Europe is not able to act together </info>
    <info>when it sees its interests at stake.</info>
    <info>    But there are other cases where the European Union has failed to </info>
    <info>reach consensus on taking unified action. One example in recent years </info>
    <info>was the European Union being unable to agree on a resolution that was </info>
    <info>up at the United Nations that criticized China's human rights record. </info>
    <info>Now, that resolution was torpedoed by Greece. Greece, which has been a </info>
    <info>recipient of a significant amount of Chinese investment since the </info>
    <info>European and global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. So China's </info>
    <info>growing economic stake in Europe, and China's promotion of arrangements </info>
    <info>like the 16+1, raised major concerns in Europe, as I think they do for </info>
    <info>the United States, that China will try to use its economic influence to </info>
    <info>divide Europe and prevent the European Union from achieving common and </info>
    <info>critical positions on matters of concern to Beijing.</info>
    <info>    There's also a rising concern in many European countries about </info>
    <info>investment by China in Europe--and from other countries, not just </info>
    <info>China, investment in strategically significant industries. Currently, </info>
    <info>that's a national competency. It is the responsibility of EU member </info>
    <info>states to have their own national standards. But this has led to </info>
    <info>proposals for an EU-wide investment screening framework. It's currently </info>
    <info>under discussion, and has not been concluded. But if the United States </info>
    <info>sees China's economic model and its predatory capitalist approach, its </info>
    <info>theft of intellectual property, and its attempt to use its </info>
    <info>infrastructure investment to gain political influence, it seems to me </info>
    <info>obvious that the United States has an interest in a robust and unified </info>
    <info>European response, rather than piecemeal national efforts that will </info>
    <info>allow countries to be picked off one by one.</info>
    <info>    Now, you could also look at this as a situation that the United </info>
    <info>States could seek to exploit for its own national benefit. In that </info>
    <info>sense, the question would be: Is anti-establishment or populist or </info>
    <info>nationalist politics an opportunity for the United States or a threat? </info>
    <info>Does the rise of populism and its stress on sovereignty present new </info>
    <info>opportunities to promote U.S. interests more effectively? In other </info>
    <info>words, is there a silver lining in that cloud?</info>
    <info>    I would start by looking, again, at the EU sanctions on Russia. In </info>
    <info>international economic diplomacy, the EU has had much more at stake in </info>
    <info>its relationship with Russia. And it has made much greater sacrifices, </info>
    <info>frankly, than the United States has economically in trying to impose </info>
    <info>costs on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.</info>
    <info>    Now, it's a separate question whether there could have been other </info>
    <info>responses. For example, the Obama administration was unwilling to sell </info>
    <info>lethal arms to Ukraine. That's a policy that's been reversed by the </info>
    <info>Trump administration. I think that's a topic that's worthy of debate </info>
    <info>and discussion, especially critical discussion with our European </info>
    <info>friends and allies. But it's clear that the Europeans have made greater </info>
    <info>economic sacrifices in trying to constrain Russia in its revanchist </info>
    <info>project in Europe.</info>
    <info>    And regardless of what you think of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of </info>
    <info>Action (JCPOA), it is also true that European Union countries were </info>
    <info>willing to impose substantial costs on their own firms in order to try </info>
    <info>to bring Iran to the negotiating table. Again, that's separate from </info>
    <info>discussing the merits of the JCPOA, which is perhaps worthy to do, but </info>
    <info>I don't think it's really the topic of this panel. But the point is, </info>
    <info>Europe is able to act when we forge common cause on crucial issues, and </info>
    <info>that benefits, in my view, the United States.</info>
    <info>    And more broadly, I think the benefit to the United States in </info>
    <info>populist contagion is chimerical. We can seek it, but we're never </info>
    <info>really going to find it. It is precisely the nationalist governments in </info>
    <info>Europe that exhibit the greatest sympathy for Vladimir Putin's Russia. </info>
    <info>If you look at Italy, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who's </info>
    <info>the leader of the far-right Lega Party, which now has the highest </info>
    <info>proportion of public support--according to opinion polls--recently </info>
    <info>visited Moscow. He is vocal in his opposition to sanctions on Russia. </info>
    <info>Hungarian President Victor Orban has called for lifting sanctions, as </info>
    <info>have the Czech Republic and Greece. Austria is sympathetic. And by the </info>
    <info>way, the right-wing FPO, which is part of the ruling coalition in </info>
    <info>Vienna, even concluded a cooperation agreement with the United Russia </info>
    <info>party of President Putin.</info>
    <info>    Poland is the one exception to that trend. It is a nationalist-</info>
    <info>oriented government that remains tough on Russia. But it's the </info>
    <info>exception. There is a high degree of correlation between nationalist </info>
    <info>governments in Europe and pro-Russian sentiment. So if Russia is one of </info>
    <info>our top geopolitical competitors, one of the top two challenges we face </info>
    <info>if you take the hierarchy of the administration, why should the United </info>
    <info>States be encouraging Moscow's best friends? I don't see it.</info>
    <info>    Now, I think there's a legitimate criticism of European leaders. </info>
    <info>There has been a lack of sufficient creativity and political </info>
    <info>willingness on the part of many European countries, and at the European </info>
    <info>Union level, to play a stronger international role, and to be proactive </info>
    <info>in trying to find issues around which the United States and Europe can </info>
    <info>coalesce. So I don't mean to try to suggest that they don't bear a </info>
    <info>share of responsibility for finding the substantive elements of a </info>
    <info>future-oriented agenda between the United States and Europe. But I </info>
    <info>think our focus today is on U.S. policy toward Europe, which is why </info>
    <info>I've directed my remarks there.</info>
    <info>    I would conclude by saying that when you get to burden sharing, </info>
    <info>which, Kyle, you mentioned at the very start, I think we need to be </info>
    <info>clear about what we seek from burden sharing. There is a focus on 2 </info>
    <info>percent of spending, but I think Ted Bromund also raised the question </info>
    <info>about what role burden sharing plays. I heard--you can correct me if I </info>
    <info>misunderstood--a criticism of the U.S. that it has tried to outsource </info>
    <info>the security relationship to Europeans and to the European Union. I </info>
    <info>think there's a tension, though, between whether we want Europeans to </info>
    <info>bear their share of the security responsibility for transatlantic </info>
    <info>security, for our shared security--whether we want them to do that or </info>
    <info>not.</info>
    <info>    I think we should have European countries bearing their share of </info>
    <info>the security burden. They have not done as much as they should have </info>
    <info>over the years. I think the way to get there is through persistent, </info>
    <info>effective diplomacy that takes American policy desires and finds ways </info>
    <info>to promote those in ways that build European support, not just of </info>
    <info>governments but of publics as well, for this common security agenda.</info>
    <info>    So I would just end by saying I think rather than being an open and </info>
    <info>declared enemy of U.S. objectives in Europe, as Ted Bromund put it in </info>
    <info>talking about the European Union, I would say the Europeans are our </info>
    <info>closest allies, our most effective partners when you look at the </info>
    <info>challenges we face in the world. And we need to focus on ways to </info>
    <info>collaborate with them, rather than to demonize them and to try to stoke </info>
    <info>animosity across the Atlantic.</info>
    <info>    Thank you very much.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Thanks, Jeff.</info>
    <info>    I see in these three excellent presentations really an opportunity </info>
    <info>for a classic debate to break out, but I'm going to try to manage this </info>
    <info>as a conversation rather than a debate format. Let me ask a couple of </info>
    <info>kind of framing questions before I go back to the audience, because--</info>
    <info>I'm sure there's a lot that the audience would like to jump in on here. </info>
    <info>Clearly some different perspectives were expressed on the level of </info>
    <info>leadership in the European Union currently and U.S. policy, and where </info>
    <info>it should be going.</info>
    <info>    But let me start with asking Ted, perhaps, to respond to Jeff's </info>
    <info>last point, which is the tension between Europeans bearing their fair </info>
    <info>share for providing security in their own region, as opposed to the </info>
    <info>tension that we have with the outsourcing debate. If you could--and </info>
    <info>we've got a number of things on the table, so I'll ask your responses </info>
    <info>to be relatively brief, in the 2-minute range.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Bromund. That's a really excellent question. Let me start off </info>
    <info>by saying that in my view the point of increased European spending on </info>
    <info>defense is not primarily to acquire additional military capabilities. </info>
    <info>Those are, of course, desirable and they are necessary. But that is not </info>
    <info>the main point. The main point of increased European defense spending </info>
    <info>is to reinforce the American political consensus in favor of a strong </info>
    <info>American contribution to European defense. It has been an argument for </info>
    <info>generations that the political consensus in the U.S. in favor of NATO </info>
    <info>is not sustainable unless the Europeans pay a fair share and are seen </info>
    <info>by the American people to pay a fair share. So I am opposed to </info>
    <info>outsourcing security to the Europeans or to the European Union and I </info>
    <info>want them to pay a fair share precisely because that is the only way to </info>
    <info>ensure that we also play a role over the long run.</info>
    <info>    Let me explain what I mean specifically by ``outsourcing'' with </info>
    <info>some historical examples. In the 1990s, after the end of the cold war, </info>
    <info>we did everything we could under two administrations to try to leave </info>
    <info>the Balkan wars to the Europeans. We eventually were forced to </info>
    <info>intervene. I'm very glad that we did. But we delayed, and delayed, and </info>
    <info>delayed. After the cold war, reductions in U.S. forces in Europe were </info>
    <info>certainly necessary and warranted. But they went much too far. We took </info>
    <info>over 90 percent of our forces and, under the Obama administration, all </info>
    <info>of our armor out of Europe. There was excessive U.S. disinvestment in </info>
    <info>European security. When you take a look at crises on the European </info>
    <info>border, in my view, we have tried and tried and tried to leave it to </info>
    <info>the Europeans, only in the end to belatedly have to get involved. Libya </info>
    <info>is the classic example here.</info>
    <info>    So I am unhappy with the U.S. approach that doesn't take a strong </info>
    <info>leadership position on security issues in and around Europe, that </info>
    <info>outsources. But I am equally unhappy with a European underspend </info>
    <info>approach, precisely because it reinforces our desire--which we have had </info>
    <info>since the Eisenhower administration--to try to leave all these things </info>
    <info>to the Europeans. These are not contradictory factors. They are </info>
    <info>complementary problems. And they can only be solved by addressing both </info>
    <info>of them together.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Let me shift gears on a question to Paul and go back </info>
    <info>to something that was present in your presentation. You described the </info>
    <info>potential for a healthy nationalism.</info>
    <info>    I think, Ted, if I jotted this down correctly, you used the phrase </info>
    <info>``nationalism is necessary'' and it's become a ``dirty word'' in </info>
    <info>Europe.</info>
    <info>    I would love for the two of you, but let's start with Paul, to help </info>
    <info>us understand where the line is between a healthy nationalism and a </info>
    <info>potentially unhealthy nationalism. I think this gets to one of Kyle's </info>
    <info>framing points about Germany. Are we concerned about a nationalism that </info>
    <info>would develop in a manner that would be contrary to peace and security </info>
    <info>on the European continent and, therefore, to the United States' </info>
    <info>interests?</info>
    <info>    Paul, I'd like for you to take a crack at that and maybe Jeff </info>
    <info>after. Thanks.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Coyer. Sure. This is a good question. And just to reinforce, </info>
    <info>yes, I do believe there are healthy and unhealthy nationalisms.</info>
    <info>    One of the things that I disagree with in the rhetoric that we hear </info>
    <info>coming out of EU leaders uniformly is that nationalism is always seen </info>
    <info>in the pejorative and they don't recognize the fact that there is a </info>
    <info>healthy form of nationalism. As Ted alluded to, it was in the context </info>
    <info>of the modern nation-state that we developed modern democratic </info>
    <info>governance and representative governance, human rights protections, </info>
    <info>that sort of thing, the rule of law. Liah Greenfield of Boston </info>
    <info>University and many other academics have written about this, that </info>
    <info>without the modern nation-state we would not have democracy.</info>
    <info>    Getting to your question of where to draw the line, I don't think </info>
    <info>it is exactly a fine line, but there's a long debate that we don't have </info>
    <info>time to get into now over creedal nationalism, which we see in the </info>
    <info>United States, where we are defined by a creed that came out of the </info>
    <info>Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as opposed to an </info>
    <info>ethnic nationalism that you see prominently in places like Russia. It </info>
    <info>isn't just ethnic there, it's more cultural; but there's an ethnic </info>
    <info>component to it, with the Russian world being a big, supposedly unified </info>
    <info>culture in the post-Soviet space.</info>
    <info>    I have Serbian friends. The Serbs constantly get criticized, </info>
    <info>sometimes justifiably when you look at their history, for an ethnic </info>
    <info>Serb nationalism that is a bit virulent. So when you do have a </info>
    <info>nationalism that, in my view, is defined by an ethnicity more than </info>
    <info>anything else, that's particularly where you need to double down on </info>
    <info>democracy promotion and the rule of law and transparency, that sort of </info>
    <info>thing.</info>
    <info>    Philosophically speaking, a healthy nationalism, in my view, is one </info>
    <info>that appreciates one's own traditions and culture while also </info>
    <info>appreciating those of other people. There's a point that's made by a </info>
    <info>friend of mine, Yoram Hazony, an Israeli scholar that just came out </info>
    <info>with a book called ``The Virtues of Nationalism,'' a title that tells </info>
    <info>you where he's coming from. And one of the things that he says is that </info>
    <info>we should try to inculcate a type of nationalism that is characterized </info>
    <info>by humility in our own national distinctiveness, a pride in it, but not </info>
    <info>an overweening pride; a sense of our own distinctiveness that also is </info>
    <info>tempered by humility, knowing that we are not the be-all and end-all of </info>
    <info>cultural achievement.</info>
    <info>    When you can look at other cultures--my wife, for instance, is a </info>
    <info>Venezuelan. I've lived much of my life overseas. When you look at other </info>
    <info>cultures and can appreciate their distinctiveness and where they might </info>
    <info>have some aspects of their culture that are superior to your own, that </info>
    <info>can provide a limiting effect on a tendency toward an overweening </info>
    <info>pride.</info>
    <info>    I mean--this could be the topic of a whole daylong discussion, </info>
    <info>obviously. The chapter that I told you about that I wrote on this issue </info>
    <info>approaches nationalism specifically from an ethical point of view. And </info>
    <info>that was only 20 pages long, and that could easily have been 2[00] or </info>
    <info>300. So I'll end my brief remarks there.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. We appreciate the executive summary.</info>
    <info>    Thank you. [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    Jeff, over to you.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Rathke. Thanks. So I wanted to touch on a couple of things.</info>
    <info>    First, I think it's important to remember that support for NATO in </info>
    <info>the United States is at an all-time high. On the one hand, that </info>
    <info>suggests a commitment by the American public to the transatlantic </info>
    <info>security alliance. I think it's also worth noting at the same time that </info>
    <info>there is a divergence, an increasing divergence, in the views of </info>
    <info>people, based on their political affiliations in the United States, </info>
    <info>toward NATO. I think, while there has been a dramatic rise among </info>
    <info>independents and supporters of the Democratic Party in their support </info>
    <info>for NATO, among Republicans it has declined, which I think is certainly </info>
    <info>regrettable. I think it's probably a function of the administration's </info>
    <info>harping on the 2 percent target. But nevertheless, taken as a whole, </info>
    <info>American public support for NATO is increasing.</info>
    <info>    I would also highlight that if you look at public support for the </info>
    <info>European Union across EU member states, you find that in many of the </info>
    <info>countries whose governments are most critical of Brussels, you actually </info>
    <info>have the highest level of public support for their membership in the </info>
    <info>European Union. So I think it's a more complicated issue than is </info>
    <info>sometimes presented in the media, as far as publics being frustrated </info>
    <info>with Brussels and questioning the value of the European Union.</info>
    <info>    But I wanted to come back to the question you asked about Germany, </info>
    <info>and which Kyle also mentioned at the start, and Germany's role. Kyle, </info>
    <info>the way you put it is: If Germany spent 2 percent on defense, would we </info>
    <info>have a problem in Europe? I would go back to the always-quotable Radek </info>
    <info>Sikorski, former minister and defense minister of Poland, who said </info>
    <info>quite a few years ago that he fears German weakness more than he fears </info>
    <info>German strength. And I think that is still the case. Germany needs to </info>
    <info>do more in the defense realm. Germany acknowledges it, but the progress </info>
    <info>has been very, very slow, slower than anyone, I think, would like. But </info>
    <info>I don't think there's any real objection to Germany increasing its </info>
    <info>commitment to the transatlantic alliance. Instead, I think there's just </info>
    <info>frustration that it hasn't been going as fast as people would like.</info>
    <info>    That has deeper roots within the German public, among the political </info>
    <info>parties. And as much as we might like to see it go faster, I'm not sure </info>
    <info>it's going to speed up even with a change in the Christian Democratic </info>
    <info>Union leadership, frankly, because it brings up questions of </info>
    <info>complicated coalition politics--what government can be formed if there </info>
    <info>ever is a change of government, and what political coalition will move </info>
    <info>Germany faster toward that goal.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Colleagues and friends in the audience, I think I've </info>
    <info>stood between you and the panel for long enough now. I would love to </info>
    <info>take some questions from the audience and keep my own in abeyance for </info>
    <info>now.</info>
    <info>    I see a hand in the back on the right. Please identify yourself, if </info>
    <info>you could.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Hi. My name is Ben. I'm an intern with Congressman </info>
    <info>Cohen.</info>
    <info>    My question was, I understand the point that you were making on </info>
    <info>European technocratic authenticity separate from the people who can be </info>
    <info>difficult to support, but what is the ideal format for the European </info>
    <info>Union that has this sovereign diversity of strength that you see? Is it </info>
    <info>a U.N.-style secretariat? Does it continue to have a transnational </info>
    <info>parliament? Does it focus more on the Council and backroom deals? I'm </info>
    <info>not quite seeing how it maintains the sovereignty of strength and </info>
    <info>continues to include the people, if you have thoughts on that.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Thanks. Let me add to that. If we find a different </info>
    <info>institutional framework for the European Union, I would like Ted and </info>
    <info>Paul both to respond to this because it also gets to, I think, Jeff's </info>
    <info>advocacy of the EU as a partner of first resort, I think was his word, </info>
    <info>on challenges internationally. If we find a different kind of </info>
    <info>governance structure that's more responsive to the public, as you've </info>
    <info>described, do we lose a kind of a partnership with the EU, and on what </info>
    <info>areas? How would that cooperation look under a different kind of </info>
    <info>governance structure, as well?</info>
    <info>    Dr. Coyer. I can start and then we can move over to Ted, I guess.</info>
    <info>    I think one place I would start would be the European Commission, </info>
    <info>which people in Europe don't feel is responsive to them. That needs to </info>
    <info>change.</info>
    <info>    To answer the issue that Alex raised just now, I don't think a </info>
    <info>change in governing structure, however you look at it or redefine it or </info>
    <info>reshape it, necessarily means a reduction in American partnering </info>
    <info>capacity with Europe. I think that you can certainly do it in such a </info>
    <info>way where we continue that strong relationship.</info>
    <info>    And I completely agree with much of what Jeff said, that we need </info>
    <info>that transatlantic relationship. I not only teach in France, I did my </info>
    <info>Ph.D. in Britain, travel there a lot, and of course we need that.</info>
    <info>    Now, specifics how to structure it are harder to define and that </info>
    <info>would take some more careful thought. I would just start with the EC </info>
    <info>because that's the obvious target. That's the one that people point to </info>
    <info>the most as being unaccountable.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Bromund. I'll pick up on that just quickly. I appreciate the </info>
    <info>question and I appreciate that it's a very serious one. I'm a little </info>
    <info>reluctant as an American to sort of sit here dispensing my purported </info>
    <info>wisdom about the way the EU should be organized, which, frankly, </info>
    <info>whatever I say will have absolutely no impact on what they do. So with </info>
    <info>all respect to what is clearly a very serious question, I'm not sure </info>
    <info>that this is something where American input is going to be very </info>
    <info>usefully offered.</info>
    <info>    My personal instinct--and I emphasize personal--is that the way for </info>
    <info>sovereign democratic nations to cooperate is through the traditional </info>
    <info>mechanisms of interstate diplomacy. You can call that backroom deals </info>
    <info>for the European Council if you care to, I would call it diplomacy. </info>
    <info>Probably Woodrow Wilson would also have called it backroom deals. But I </info>
    <info>remain very supportive of that basic mode of operation, if only because </info>
    <info>I think diplomacy is the way that civilized nations do business and </info>
    <info>diplomacy is traditionally done by sovereign nation states.</info>
    <info>    On the question of European partnership, well, let's look at the </info>
    <info>five big challenges. I agree there are rising concerns, but the EU has </info>
    <info>played, and European nations in general have played, a largely </info>
    <info>negligible role in concerns about China. And in my view, they will </info>
    <info>continue to play a largely negligible role.</info>
    <info>    Europe does, of course, have a role in combating terrorism. I'm not </info>
    <info>sure that European efforts in the North African Sahel regions have been </info>
    <info>particularly successful.</info>
    <info>    Europe is a nonfactor on North Korea, simply does not matter in the </info>
    <info>North Korean issue.</info>
    <info>    And we come to Russia. Jeff mentioned the sacrifices that Europeans </info>
    <info>and the EU have made vis-a-vis Russian sanctions. Of course, there have </info>
    <info>been more economic losses due to sanctions in Europe than there have </info>
    <info>been in the United States because they trade more with Russia--or did </info>
    <info>trade more with Russia--than we do. But the Russians have invaded and </info>
    <info>occupied a nation in Europe and we are sitting here saying, oh, the EU </info>
    <info>has done wonderful things because it has imposed really some fairly </info>
    <info>limited and not always effective sanctions on the Russians and we are </info>
    <info>busy patting them on the back for this tremendous achievement. This is </info>
    <info>not a tremendous achievement.</info>
    <info>    Jeff passed over Nord Stream 2 fairly quickly. In the midst of all </info>
    <info>of this supposedly brilliant sanctioning achievement, Germany is busy </info>
    <info>totally on its own backing and constructing a gas pipeline to Russia, </info>
    <info>which is absolutely going to have an infinitely greater restorative </info>
    <info>effect on the Russian economy than all the EU sanctions have had a </info>
    <info>negative effect.</info>
    <info>    I am stunned by the paucity of the EU's and the Europeans' ambition </info>
    <info>in this regard. And I'm stunned by our willingness to give them credit </info>
    <info>for doing well when in response to a Russian invasion of a European </info>
    <info>nation they have done so little. Let's not pitch our ambitions here too </info>
    <info>low. If the EU and the Europeans want to play a serious security role </info>
    <info>in their own continent, the invasion of a European nation needs to be </info>
    <info>met with more than a few economic sanctions.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Sure, Jeff, please.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Rathke. Thanks. I'll respond to that point. I did not use the </info>
    <info>words ``wonderful'' or ``tremendous achievement.'' I said that the </info>
    <info>European Union's sanctions have made a greater economic impact than the </info>
    <info>United States' economic sanctions. And you're right, it's because </info>
    <info>Europeans previously did trade more with Russia. That's a function of </info>
    <info>geography, it's a function of Russia being a natural resource exporter. </info>
    <info>There's not exactly a value judgment behind that, I think.</info>
    <info>    I think the fact is that, confronted with the invasion and </info>
    <info>occupation of a European country, there has been a relatively </info>
    <info>consistent European response. It could have been done more in other </info>
    <info>areas, I agree with you.</info>
    <info>    But I think we also have to be honest about what the scope was for </info>
    <info>nonmilitary action in response to the invasion of Ukraine. That is, I </info>
    <info>think, a different and broader topic to discuss.</info>
    <info>    I wanted to come back to the question about what's the right </info>
    <info>structure. Like Ted, I wouldn't want to prescribe, but I would </info>
    <info>highlight, for example, counterterrorism, which is clearly an issue of </info>
    <info>concern for the United States as well as for European governments and </info>
    <info>for Europe collectively. And if you look at the response since the </info>
    <info>attacks in Paris and in Brussels, for example, you see a greater role </info>
    <info>being played by European institutions in information sharing, things </info>
    <info>like passenger name recognition and so forth. On the European level, </info>
    <info>greater responsibility Europe-wide for things that contribute to the </info>
    <info>fight against terrorism and law enforcement.</info>
    <info>    It seems to me that that benefits the United States because the </info>
    <info>more the Europeans are coordinated among themselves and sharing </info>
    <info>information, the easier it is for the United States to work with them </info>
    <info>rather than to work with 28 individual member States. So I think that </info>
    <info>suggests another area of benefit to the United States that we haven't </info>
    <info>talked about before.</info>
    <info>    With respect to China and whether the EU will play a significant </info>
    <info>role, I think one of the interesting things this administration is </info>
    <info>doing is to partner with the European Union and Japan to try to address </info>
    <info>what they refer to as global economic issues, which is really about how </info>
    <info>to deal with China's growing international economic role. So I think </info>
    <info>that is an indication of readiness to engage with this U.S. Government. </info>
    <info>And I think that's a welcome thing. The greater collection of countries </info>
    <info>that are interested in open economies, the better for the U.S.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Thanks, Jeff.</info>
    <info>    I'd like to take another few questions from the audience if I </info>
    <info>could. I see a lot of hands. Great. Let me start in the corner, </info>
    <info>standing up.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Hi. My name is Erika Schlager. I'm with the Helsinki </info>
    <info>Commission staff. Thank you for this extremely interesting program this </info>
    <info>morning.</info>
    <info>    I want to preface my question with a little comment on the </info>
    <info>definitional issue that was at the start of this panel, how we're </info>
    <info>describing various political parties today. And I certainly agree that </info>
    <info>the terminology that we have available doesn't seem to be as helpful as </info>
    <info>we might like.</info>
    <info>    So extremist, populist, even left, right aren't necessarily very </info>
    <info>informative anymore and there may be a quick consideration of whether </info>
    <info>certain parties or political actors have fascist tendencies. I would </info>
    <info>like to hear more people discussing whether they have communist-era </info>
    <info>tendencies, whether some of the policies and practices echo somewhat </info>
    <info>the 1945 to 1948 practices that we saw and the takeover of communism in </info>
    <info>Central Europe.</info>
    <info>    That said, I am now going to use the word ``nationalism'' since we </info>
    <info>sort of concluded our discussion there. And it seems to me that we're </info>
    <info>sort of talking about two levels here: U.S. policy toward what's going </info>
    <info>on in specific individual EU countries and then the U.S. policy toward </info>
    <info>the EU itself. And with respect to the nationalist voices--caveated use </info>
    <info>of that word--but with respect to the nationalist voices or parties or </info>
    <info>nonstandard parties that are emerging, it seems to me that one of the </info>
    <info>challenges or one of the problems that we face is that those </info>
    <info>nationalist parties and voices also tend to be the ones advancing anti-</info>
    <info>human rights policies and anti-democratic policies. And I'm thinking </info>
    <info>about the extreme centralization that's taking place in Hungary, the </info>
    <info>rise in anti-Semitism and historical revisionism, stripping religions </info>
    <info>of their religious status, the purging of the supreme court in Poland </info>
    <info>and the reintroduction of the Soviet-era feature of lay judges and the </info>
    <info>end of the finality of legal decisions and the end of legal certainty.</info>
    <info>    So are there nationalist voices that are also pro-democracy and </info>
    <info>pro-human rights? Because it seems to me, if you can't get those two </info>
    <info>things to go together, it's going to be hard for us to be neutral or </info>
    <info>supportive of a different kind of nationalism. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Please.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Bromund. Well, I'll gladly take a crack at that one. It </info>
    <info>probably should have been obvious from our remarks, but I'll just spell </info>
    <info>it out here. I am rather skeptical about the value of a lot of these </info>
    <info>populist movements, however one sort of cares to classify them--not all </info>
    <info>of them, but most of them. And I largely agree with Jeff's comment </info>
    <info>that, although not all populist or nationalist movements in Europe are </info>
    <info>associated with the Russians, there is more of an alignment there than </info>
    <info>one might care to see.</info>
    <info>    But I don't think we can necessarily stop there. If our answer to </info>
    <info>these populist or nationalist movements is to say ``We reject them </info>
    <info>completely, we need to go back to the old system,'' we're, therefore, </info>
    <info>left with a problem. Where did these movements come from in the first </info>
    <info>place? They came from the old system. So, obviously, something was not </info>
    <info>satisfactory in the previous setup and simply condemning the new </info>
    <info>developments without trying to sort of fix or revive or change the </info>
    <info>older system is probably not going to get very far. It's going to put </info>
    <info>us right back where we are today or maybe even a worse place.</info>
    <info>    That really is the point of my argument, that we need to think </info>
    <info>about economic growth in Europe. I don't see how you have stable </info>
    <info>Christian Democratic or Social Democratic parties without reasonable </info>
    <info>levels of growth. I don't see how you have them without more awareness </info>
    <info>of Europe's cultural and, largely, Christian past, to take Paul's </info>
    <info>point. And I don't think you can have them without a meaningful </info>
    <info>approach to national security, which includes strong and reasonable </info>
    <info>border controls. If you don't have those things, I think you're going </info>
    <info>to be pushed in some undesirable or different--frequently undesirable--</info>
    <info>direction.</info>
    <info>    But you put your finger really on the core of the problem. We are </info>
    <info>where we are in Europe because of a series of policies and events that </info>
    <info>have happened over the last 70 years, many of which, in my view, were a </info>
    <info>mistake. And we are now in a position where the routes out of that </info>
    <info>series of errors are frequently very unattractive for precisely the </info>
    <info>reasons that you and Jeff and indeed Paul and also I set out.</info>
    <info>    So how do we go forward? Do we simply approve of every populist or </info>
    <info>nationalist movement that appears in Europe? I simply don't propose to </info>
    <info>do any such thing. But can we have policies which make it clear that we </info>
    <info>prioritize growth over stability? I think we can. I believe we should.</info>
    <info>    Should we have a strong deterrent policy toward the Russians? I </info>
    <info>believe that's absolutely necessary. Should we back firm European </info>
    <info>border controls? I think politically in Europe that is an absolute </info>
    <info>necessity right now. If we don't back sensible things that are somewhat </info>
    <info>different from the immediate past consensus, we will simply get more of </info>
    <info>these movements, some of which are going to do things that we are going </info>
    <info>to find extremely distasteful.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Paul?</info>
    <info>    Dr. Coyer. I would just agree with that. And I would just add to </info>
    <info>that, I think a void in the national aspirations of many Europeans has </info>
    <info>been created in the manner which I have described and Ted has spoken to </info>
    <info>as well. And when you don't fill the void with something that's </info>
    <info>healthy, it's going to be filled with something that's unhealthy. And </info>
    <info>that's why I think we need to take an active role in defining and </info>
    <info>shaping a healthy sort of nationalism that includes human rights </info>
    <info>protections.</info>
    <info>    Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, modern conceptions of human rights, </info>
    <info>modern democratic governance, the rule of law, all that arose in the </info>
    <info>context of a modern nation-state. So it is not mutually exclusive. I </info>
    <info>don't see nationalism as being something that's in contradiction to all </info>
    <info>those aspirations and those things that we need. So I think that we </info>
    <info>need to be actively involved in shaping a healthy form of nationalism </info>
    <info>and defining that so that these sorts of issues are addressed.</info>
    <info>    And I also agree with you, and as Ted also said, there is a </info>
    <info>negative tendency on the part of not all, but some of these movements </info>
    <info>within Europe to be too sympathetic to Putin and to Russia. This is </info>
    <info>another reason we need to be heavily involved. I think I made this </info>
    <info>point in my initial statement as well--the more the EU leaders double </info>
    <info>down on their blanket condemnation of national identity and tradition </info>
    <info>and that sort of thing, the more it plays into the hands of Putin and </info>
    <info>gives rise to some of these negative actors.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Jeff, I'm actually going to beg your forgiveness and </info>
    <info>ask you to hold your comments because we're getting close to the end of </info>
    <info>our time here today and I saw a number of questions in the audience. I </info>
    <info>really would like to give folks a chance to participate.</info>
    <info>    So what I propose is a kind of a lightning round where I take as </info>
    <info>many questions as I can and our panelists do their best to take what </info>
    <info>they can and respond and offer any final remarks at this point.</info>
    <info>    So I see in the front row here and then in the back and then in the </info>
    <info>far back, one, two, three. Am I missing anybody else? Okay, four, </info>
    <info>great. We'll do four at once.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Should I skip the identification, or is that still </info>
    <info>important?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. No, it's important for the transcript.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Short, please. Yes. Per Bergstrom [sp], Senator </info>
    <info>Murray's office. These are mostly my thoughts.</info>
    <info>    Merkel seems to be getting out while the going is still good. And </info>
    <info>with her out of the picture, it seems that only Macron in France is a </info>
    <info>major European head of state that seems to be willing to speak for the </info>
    <info>European project. How do you think this affects the dynamics we've been </info>
    <info>talking about today?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Great. Do me a favor and hand the microphone straight </info>
    <info>back.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Mark Toner, Helsinki Commission, the State Department's </info>
    <info>senior adviser.</info>
    <info>    My question is pretty basic and simple, which is, soft power </info>
    <info>diplomacy. This is my view--but we've let the transatlantic </info>
    <info>relationship atrophy, and by that I mean we had this distinct </info>
    <info>relationship with the post-war generation of Europeans that understood </info>
    <info>and appreciated America's role. And that relationship between Europe </info>
    <info>and America, I don't think the new generation has that appreciation.</info>
    <info>    We talk about working within multilateral settings with the EU and </info>
    <info>at NATO, but I think that relationship doesn't filter down to the </info>
    <info>publics both in America, despite Jeff's quoting strong support for </info>
    <info>NATO, but certainly in most European populations. So how do we </info>
    <info>revitalize that?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Great. And then one here and then in the far back, </info>
    <info>please.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Hi. I'm Andrew Myslik with Congressman Larson's office, </info>
    <info>also speaking from my views.</info>
    <info>    I am curious, to go on a NATO stretch here, how much stock and how </info>
    <info>should we define 2 percent of GDP as well as the 20 percent threshold </info>
    <info>contained within that, specifically given that a lot of European </info>
    <info>nations in the east, should NATO have to move heavy weaponry such as </info>
    <info>U.S. tanks rapidly east, could not actually support a lot of that </info>
    <info>infrastructure in their trains and their bridges. So there has been </info>
    <info>this debate and an ongoing debate in NATO regarding how 2 percent GDP </info>
    <info>should be defined.</info>
    <info>    And then also, we in the U.S. like to say that we are spending all </info>
    <info>this and carrying all this burden--and we certainly are carrying a very </info>
    <info>large burden, we spend upwards of 3\1/2\ percent--I'm not sure of it </info>
    <info>exactly--but a lot of that is spent out of NATO areas. So are we </info>
    <info>actually carrying a sufficient burden in NATO as well?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Great, thanks for that. And I will commend to you the </info>
    <info>transcript of a briefing we did with General Ben Hodges just after he </info>
    <info>retired as U.S. Army commander in Europe on precisely that subject.</info>
    <info>    Paul, please.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Paul Massaro with the Helsinki Commission.</info>
    <info>    A few years ago, it looked like the next big step in transatlantic </info>
    <info>relations would be an EU-U.S. free trade agreement. That appears to be </info>
    <info>totally off the table now and outside of the discussion. To what extent </info>
    <info>should free trade be part of the U.S. approach to Europe?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. Great, thanks. And very succinct, thank you.</info>
    <info>    Here's what I propose. Let's start in the opposite order that we </info>
    <info>did the panel, so we'll go to Jeff and then in this direction, for your </info>
    <info>final thoughts.</info>
    <info>    Thanks.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Rathke. Okay. I will be quick. So, Paul, to your question, I </info>
    <info>think there should certainly be the ambition to work on, whether it is </info>
    <info>tariffs or nontariff barriers or the kind of global structural issues, </info>
    <info>the economy, the United States and Europe need to be working together. </info>
    <info>Whether that has to lead to a free trade agreement--tariffs, on </info>
    <info>average, are relatively low in the United States and in Europe already, </info>
    <info>so there is some gain to be realized there. But as we saw with the </info>
    <info>Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), both in the </info>
    <info>United States and even more crucially in Europe, there was a lot of </info>
    <info>public opposition, so you've got to figure out where you can make </info>
    <info>progress and focus energy there, I think, as the first order of </info>
    <info>business.</info>
    <info>    On the 2 percent, 20 percent question, 2 percent has always, for a </info>
    <info>long time, been something the United States wanted NATO to adopt. And </info>
    <info>it predated the Trump administration. I think the difference now is </info>
    <info>there is a singular focus on that one number, which does not always </info>
    <info>bring countries along to increase their contributions. I think 20 </info>
    <info>percent matters more because that's actual investment in real military </info>
    <info>capabilities, that is 20 percent of spending on R&amp;amp;D and procurement of </info>
    <info>equipment.</info>
    <info>    I think we need to define what capabilities we want Europeans to </info>
    <info>have and then hold them to those commitments. We need to measure </info>
    <info>outputs rather than inputs. And if we measure only inputs, you can have </info>
    <info>an inefficient defense establishment in country A that spends 2 percent </info>
    <info>and accomplishes much less than a country B that spends it efficiently.</info>
    <info>    As for the future of the European project, Angela Merkel is going </info>
    <info>to remain chancellor of Germany. She's not going to run for her party </info>
    <info>leadership, but she, depending on how that turns out, she could remain </info>
    <info>chancellor until 2021. Now, she's weakened by the recent political </info>
    <info>developments, so whether Germany is going to play an active role will </info>
    <info>depend a lot on how this succession takes place. But it leaves France </info>
    <info>as really the country that's putting out ideas that others have to </info>
    <info>react to. But without support of other major European players, it's </info>
    <info>hard to move those forward.</info>
    <info>    One last comment because it's been discussed a little bit--growth </info>
    <info>rates. It is true that, on average, over the last 10 years, the U.S. </info>
    <info>economy has grown faster than Europe, but the gap is actually not as </info>
    <info>dramatic as it might seem. There have been years where Europe's growth </info>
    <info>rate was higher than that of the United States. And then there have </info>
    <info>been years where it's been the opposite, especially during the Greek </info>
    <info>financial crisis in the 2013, 2014, 2015 period.</info>
    <info>    But I think it would be a mistake to write off Europe's economic </info>
    <info>model as one that is ineffective and that fails to deliver. Despite its </info>
    <info>problems and complications there are still a lot of places across </info>
    <info>Europe where the economy is growing and where unemployment is falling.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Coyer. I'll be similarly quick. On the 2 percent issue, Ben </info>
    <info>Hodges spoke about this I think in January when he was here, that I </info>
    <info>think it's wise to look at that not just in a purely strict way, but </info>
    <info>also look in other ways that countries may contribute to our mutual </info>
    <info>defense that may not count toward the 2 percent. I think it's smart to </info>
    <info>consider that because there is a lot that other countries do. He raised </info>
    <info>the issue of Germany, which is many times criticized and has been </info>
    <info>perennially on this issue, that they give more than is counted toward </info>
    <info>their actual number.</info>
    <info>    On the issue of French leadership of the EU, Macron right now has </info>
    <info>very, very, very low approval ratings. I've forgotten what they are, </info>
    <info>but they're really bad--15 to 20 percent, something like that. So </info>
    <info>whether he sticks around very much longer is an issue as well.</info>
    <info>    As I believe I mentioned in my opening statement as well, one of </info>
    <info>the key issues that will determine how the EU thrives or whether it </info>
    <info>withers away is whether or not the ruling class in Europe can rethink </info>
    <info>their approach to governance and speak to the clearly expressed </info>
    <info>aspirations of many of the European citizenry we see in these movements </info>
    <info>that are EU skeptic movements that are arising.</info>
    <info>    About popular support on both sides of the Atlantic for the </info>
    <info>transatlantic relationship, that's a very, very good point. And that's </info>
    <info>something that I try to address in my speaking and my writing. That's </info>
    <info>actually one of the reasons why I, about 4 years ago with several </info>
    <info>friends, started this journal called ``Providence: A Journal of </info>
    <info>Christianity and American Foreign Policy,'' because on the U.S. side of </info>
    <info>the Atlantic, as you know, evangelicals and Catholics are a big voting </info>
    <info>bloc. Many times, especially evangelicals, they're not that well </info>
    <info>informed. They have kind of a kneejerk sense of what America's national </info>
    <info>identity is and what its role in the world should be, but it's not well </info>
    <info>thought out. So one of the reasons why we started this journal was to </info>
    <info>educate that critical voting bloc in the United States. And we </info>
    <info>specifically, in the area of transatlantic relations, are trying to </info>
    <info>address it from a normative and moral perspective, as well, which is a </info>
    <info>language that crowd gets as to why it's so important in terms of </info>
    <info>democracy promotion, which leads to human flourishing and freedom and </info>
    <info>thriving, which, again, is language that evangelicals and Catholics </info>
    <info>get.</info>
    <info>    That's just one aspect of the American voting bloc. The populace as </info>
    <info>a whole needs to be educated on this. Same thing in Europe, but a very </info>
    <info>good question.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Bromund. Let me take a stab at doing all four of them really </info>
    <info>quickly. U.S.-EU free trade, the United States Trade Representative has </info>
    <info>announced the intention to negotiate a trade agreement with the </info>
    <info>European Union as well as the United Kingdom and Japan, so that is back </info>
    <info>on the table in some shape or form. The fundamental problem with TTIP, </info>
    <info>in my view, was that it was an effort at regulatory harmonization to </info>
    <info>European levels. It was not a tariff-cutting, preeminently, exercise.</info>
    <info>    In my view, a regulatory tie-up between the U.S. and the European </info>
    <info>Union would do considerable long-term damage to the competitiveness of </info>
    <info>both of our economies, although it would be very convenient for large </info>
    <info>companies today who would dictate the terms of that regulatory tie-up. </info>
    <info>So unless we take a fundamentally different approach than we did during </info>
    <info>TTIP, I remain somewhat skeptical about this approach.</info>
    <info>    On 2 percent, with all due respect to General Hodges and his </info>
    <info>national service, I think he is doing an enormous disservice by </info>
    <info>promoting this line that infrastructure spending is a replacement for </info>
    <info>tanks. No amount of German autobahns or improved railways to the east </info>
    <info>are going to deter the Russians. You do not deter people with empty </info>
    <info>railcars and highways with nothing on them. It takes actual military </info>
    <info>capabilities.</info>
    <info>    All of this argument about infrastructure and logistics, I do not </info>
    <info>underrate the importance of logistics, but it all comes down to being </info>
    <info>an excuse to allow places to spend money on things that are not </info>
    <info>actually contributors to genuine deterrent power. And that is all it </info>
    <info>is. So it is a fundamental disservice to increased genuine European </info>
    <info>defense spending.</info>
    <info>    Third, soft power. I'm tempted to be flip and say the way to get </info>
    <info>the old relationship back is to have World War III because, I mean, </info>
    <info>World War II was what did it. We're not going to get that back and we </info>
    <info>shouldn't run around wishing for it to return, in some respects, </info>
    <info>because it would mean an absolute cataclysm.</info>
    <info>    I don't think there is a really easy or even a very convincing </info>
    <info>long-run answer to the correct problem that you are articulating. I am </info>
    <info>clearly a Euro skeptic and quite a firm one, but I am certainly not </info>
    <info>anti-European nations and I am not anti-European unless you narrowly </info>
    <info>mean anti-European Union by that stricture.</info>
    <info>    I don't think that there is a lot of anti-Europeanism in the </info>
    <info>American public. I do think that there is a significant element of </info>
    <info>anti-Americanism in Europe. I wouldn't say it's a predominant element, </info>
    <info>but it is there, it is a real factor and TTIP proved it, among other </info>
    <info>things. The single most useful thing that could happen would be for </info>
    <info>European political leaders to stop making excuses for anti-Americanism, </info>
    <info>full stop.</info>
    <info>    Finally, Merkel, Macron--the last time I checked, Macron was at 27 </info>
    <info>percent, so I guess he's doing a little better, but it's still </info>
    <info>terrible. Macron, in a way, is a symptom of the problem we've been </info>
    <info>talking about, right? He is another populist leader. He happens to be a </info>
    <info>somewhat more attractive one in some respects, but where are the </info>
    <info>traditional parties of France, the traditional post-Gaullist settlement </info>
    <info>parties of France at least? Macron, in some ways, is a rebellion </info>
    <info>against those parties because they were seen to be, well, failing. So </info>
    <info>for many reasons he is as much a symptom of the problem as he is any </info>
    <info>sort of potential cure for it.</info>
    <info>    That really highlights sort of the core problem here, that one can </info>
    <info>be very critical, and I am, of Chancellor Merkel or other European </info>
    <info>political leaders in big nations. But it's not very clear who the next </info>
    <info>appealing person is. One can be critical of Theresa May in Great </info>
    <info>Britain, and I am quite critical. Would you prefer Jeremy Corbyn from a </info>
    <info>transatlantic point of view? Well, I would not. Would you prefer the </info>
    <info>French nationalists to Macron? Well, I probably would not prefer them. </info>
    <info>And that's the problem that we've run into, that the political </info>
    <info>consensus now is so shallow, commands so little loyalty, but yet is so </info>
    <info>all-encompassing that when you look outside of it, many of the options </info>
    <info>are not very appealing; but when you look inside it, it's obvious that </info>
    <info>the options are not very appealing either. And that's a very bad place </info>
    <info>to be in.</info>
    <info>    Let me close on the mundane question of growth rates, which Jeff </info>
    <info>has returned to. We all prioritize growth too little, including in the </info>
    <info>United States. We are marginally better than Europe, but we, too, </info>
    <info>prioritize stability excessively and growth too little. The Europeans </info>
    <info>are on sort of one extreme of that tendency, but we ourselves are no </info>
    <info>paragon of virtue in this regard.</info>
    <info>    I will simply close and reiterate what I said at the start. After </info>
    <info>World War II, we came to the understanding that you don't have stable </info>
    <info>democratic political systems unless you have reasonably high and stable </info>
    <info>levels of economic growth. Social protection is important, but it must </info>
    <info>be balanced with growth. Everywhere in the developed world, we give too </info>
    <info>much attention to protection and too little attention to growth. And </info>
    <info>that is a rejection of the lesson that we learned the hard way by 1945.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Tiersky. With that invocation of World War II, let me thank our </info>
    <info>panelists for informing the Helsinki Commission and our broader </info>
    <info>community here in Congress and around Washington and our Facebook feed.</info>
    <info>    I think we've seen today the evidence of why it's important to air </info>
    <info>both our agreements and our disagreements, particularly at times of </info>
    <info>significant change. One key point I take away from this is that, </info>
    <info>regardless of its form, I think all of the panelists have agreed that a </info>
    <info>transatlantic partnership that is strong is crucial, even if we </info>
    <info>disagree on how to get there.</info>
    <info>    Colleagues, panelists, we appreciate your contributions to our </info>
    <info>reflection on this set of issues and in particular for staying a few </info>
    <info>minutes extra to undertake responses to the excellent questions we got </info>
    <info>from our audience here. Thank you very much for your time. [Applause.]</info>
