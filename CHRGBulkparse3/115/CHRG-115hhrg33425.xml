    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF NINA E. OLSON, NATIONAL TAXPAYER ADVOCATE</opening>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member Lewis, and
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to 
testify today regarding the operations of the Internal Revenue 
Service, and to offer some suggestions to improve the 
responsiveness of the agency to U.S. taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. OLSON">It has been nearly two decades since Congress last reviewed 
and updated the laws governing IRS operations. A lot has 
changed during that time, and tax administration would benefit 
from a fresh review of those laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. OLSON">In my written statement, I make the following points: 
First, reforms to IRS operations will be most successful if 
Congress consults widely on its proposals, engages IRS 
employees and external stakeholders, and provides the IRS with 
adequate funding to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Second, sound tax administration should be predicated on 
foundational principles, and the most important principle is 
respect for taxpayer rights. Not only is respecting the rights 
of the taxpayers who pay our Nation's bills the right thing to 
do, but there is significant empirical data that suggests 
building trust with taxpayers, which requires respecting their 
rights, enhances voluntary compliance as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. OLSON">In 2015, Congress codified the provisions of the Taxpayer 
Bill of Rights, or TBOR, as part of a provision requiring that 
the Commissioner ensure IRS employees receive training and act 
in accord with those rights. The challenge now is to ensure 
that TBOR is not merely aspirational, but is incorporated into 
the very ethos of the IRS, and explicitly into its business 
practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I believe a clear statement that taxpayers actually have 
the 10 fundamental TBOR rights would provide a stronger 
foundation for effective tax administration. And, therefore, I 
recommend that Congress enact the Taxpayer Bill of Rights as a 
freestanding provision in the Internal Revenue Code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Third, to become an effective 21st century tax 
administration, the IRS must place greater emphasis on taxpayer 
service. In my view, there is no conflict whatsoever between 
providing high-quality taxpayer service and taking actions to 
ensure tax compliance, particularly on the part of persons 
actively seeking to evade tax. It should not be an either/or 
proposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. OLSON">But to create an environment that encourages taxpayer trust 
and confidence, the IRS must change its culture from one that 
is enforcement-oriented to one that is service-oriented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Of the IRS's current appropriated budget of $11.2 billion, 
43 percent is allocated to enforcement, while only 4 percent--I 
repeat, only 4 percent--is allocated to taxpayer outreach and 
education activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. OLSON">According to IRS data, the agency dedicates only 98 
employees to conduct outreach and education to the roughly 62 
million small business and self-employed taxpayers, and only 
376 employees to conduct outreach and education to the 125 
million wage and investment taxpayers. Meanwhile, the IRS has 
over 3,000 revenue officers who collect field collection 
activity, and over 8,800 revenue agents who conduct field 
audits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. OLSON">In RRA 98, Congress directed the IRS to restate its mission 
to place a greater emphasis on serving the public and meeting 
taxpayers' needs. In response, the IRS adopted the following 
mission statement: ``Provide America's taxpayers top-quality 
service by helping them understand and meet their tax 
responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and 
fairness to all.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. OLSON">In 2009, with no public discussion or notice to Congress or 
to myself, the IRS quietly changed its mission statement to 
read, ``and enforce the tax law with integrity and fairness to 
all.'' This shift in tone and emphasis from ``applying'' to 
``enforcing'' the law suggests IRS leadership disagreed with 
the congressional directive and decided to place greater 
emphasis on enforcement in the mission statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Accordingly, I recommend that Congress require the IRS to 
revise its mission statement to reemphasize a noncoercive 
approach to tax administration and explicitly affirm the role 
of taxpayer rights as a guiding principle for tax 
administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Fourth, Congress has passed three important taxpayer rights 
bills, including RRA 98. And in my testimony, I highlight 
provisions that IRS has--that Congress has enacted, that the 
IRS has either not implemented, defined away through writ 
guidance, or only done a partial job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Fifth, RRA 98 joint oversight hearings would give Congress 
better insight into the IRS strategic and operational plans, 
promote dialogue between Congress, IRS, and interested 
stakeholders, and help ensure the tax writing and 
appropriations committees coordinate their expectations and 
approaches toward the IRS operations.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">At this time, we will now proceed to the question-and-
answer session. I think we are going to have to limit the 
questioning to four minutes instead of five, because we have a 
briefing at 10:00, so I would ask all the Members to adhere to 
that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">    As is my custom, I will hold my question until the end. I 
now recognize the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Schweikert, for 
any question he might have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHWEIKERT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ms. Olson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT">This is sort of unique for a couple of us up here because 
we are so used to actually having witnessed, particularly in 
the IRS, where we have a series of dodging stories and things 
that are frustrating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT">When we have reached out to Arizona, we actually had people 
say nice things about the organization, a little concern on 
speed, but actually said nice things. So you win a prize for 
having a unique conversation with us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT">Can I start with one thing, though, that did come up in the 
conversations we had in Arizona about this hearing that was 
coming up, and that was, with outreach to our office and then 
also to your office, individuals who are--were called in the 
gig economy, the Uber driver, the person who crowdsources their 
work through the internet, and the discussion of how they 
access information saying, ``Hey, here are the rules for me to 
save for my retirement, here are my rules on what must be set 
aside.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT">    First, as the Advocate, do you believe your organization is 
doing enough to make it easy to access that information? The 
way you post it up on your website, the way you deliver that 
information? And then the same thing for, as you observe, how 
the IRS delivers that information to those folks in that part 
of our economy?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Well, I am very concerned about this population
as it is growing. It is a very fast growing part of it. And I 
am concerned they will get into trouble with self-employment 
tax, not save for retirement, et cetera.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    One thing that my office is working on right now, that we 
receive suggestions about from other sectors, is to develop a 
wizard where people who are starting in the gig economy can 
actually go on to our taxpayer toolkit online and see all the 
steps that they need to do and get to the different places: Get 
an employer identification number, understand about calculating 
self-employment tax and when they need to pay it; get to the 
place where they can calculate or learn about the different 
forms of retirement saving, et cetera; and then, most 
importantly, if they have problems, how they can resolve them, 
including getting to the Taxpayer Advocate Service. That is 
something we are developing right now.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHWEIKERT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT">And I know that may be slightly different
than as you viewed your charter as the Advocate, but sometimes 
the Advocate may be proactive. And this is something that we 
all, as Committee Members, are going to have to deal with right 
now is that associated mother organization, if they were to 
give advice saying, ``You know you can save for your 
retirement.'' They may have just set them off as becoming an 
employee and no longer being an independent contractor. And we 
are going to have to sort of figure out, you know, what are we 
going to do to help this population be able to have that 
future?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT">    Now, on the IRS side, do we see the agency itself doing 
enough? Does the public access have access to the organization 
you are contracted with? Where does that person go right now to 
get that information?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. OLSON">So, the IRS did create a web page in response to
a small business hearing last year to address some of the 
issues for the gig economy. I think, as always, we can all do 
more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    This goes back to the fact that there are only 98 employees 
conducting outreach and education to the self-employed 
population in the United States. And there are 14 States that 
do not have one of those employees located in them.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHWEIKERT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT">And I know we are in our last 30 seconds. I
have a fixation that the use of technology as a way to direct 
folks who are having difficulties with the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT">    Do you actually, as the Advocate, almost publish saying 
this is a problem that comes to us quite often, here is how it 
has been resolved, here is the form you need? What are you 
doing proactively in that part of the world?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Well, we identified the needs of the gig economy
as a most serious problem in my annual report to Congress, and 
we made recommendations. And we have also created materials 
from my local taxpayer advocates in each State to actually 
conduct outreach proactively to groups, and that is one of 
their assignments to identify stakeholders in their 
communities.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. SCHWEIKERT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. SCHWEIKERT"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> I now recognize the distinguished
Ranking Member, Mr. Lewis, for any questions he might have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEWIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. LEWIS">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. LEWIS">    Ms. Olson, it is my understanding that you held a dozen 
public meetings around the country. What did you learn?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. OLSON">You know, it was remarkable. We learned a number
of things: One was how hard people are trying to communicate 
with the IRS and how much they actually want to. We learned 
that people thought that having digital online tools would be 
very, very helpful, but they were no replacement for talking to 
the IRS; and that there was a very strong desire for the IRS to 
hear them and listen to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. OLSON">We learned that--from all sorts of different populations, 
the concern about identity theft and the scams that are going 
on out there. Those were very strong issues. We learned about 
issues about payroll service providers ripping off taxpayers 
who are securing their services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And then we heard from experts about how best to design 
digital services to make them usable by people, but not replace 
the communication, the person-to-person communication, whether 
it is on the phone or in person. And that was a very strong 
message.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEWIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. LEWIS"> I know, as the Taxpayer Advocate, you don't
believe that quality service can be provided on the cheap.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Taxpayer service is, to me, the key way that you
build trust with taxpayers. And you can do taxpayer service 
whether you are trying to do outreach and education or within 
an audit or within collection activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. OLSON">If you take that approach that you are trying to bring the 
taxpayer into voluntary compliance and understand why they are 
having compliance difficulties, and you are listening to the 
taxpayer, then that is how you bring taxpayer service and 
taxpayer rights into what I call the ethos of the organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And there is no conflict with exercising the enforcement 
and compliance tools that you have. Providing taxpayer service 
doesn't eliminate a single one of those powers that the IRS has 
when they need to use them.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEWIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. LEWIS"> Do you think the 1998 Reform Act was successful?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I think the 1998 Reform was very successful. I
think that what we need to do is go back--and that is partly 
why I gave you all the list of some of the provisions that I 
saw that weren't successfully implemented from the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    I think what Congress focused on in 1998 was very key, and 
we need to make sure that the IRS does what you all directed 
them to do, or learn why they couldn't do it and then revise it 
so that it fits into 21st century tax administration.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEWIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. LEWIS"> Did it achieve its goals?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I think that it achieved it. It made the IRS
focus on taxpayer service, but with these budget cuts, it sort 
of moved away from that as a primary focus. And it is really 
moving away from that person-to-person contact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And I keep saying to people in the IRS, people are giving 
up their money. We are taking their money for the greater good. 
Why would we not want to talk to them and hear from them and 
listen to their concerns, even if we have to tell them, you 
know, we can't solve your problem in the way you want, this is 
the law. By listening to them, we gain trust, and that is what 
we need to do. And we have gotten away from that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEWIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. LEWIS"> Again, thank you for being here, and thank you
for your years of service.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">I now recognize the gentlelady, Mrs.
Walorski, from Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Mrs. WALORSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Thanks, Ms. Olson. Again, many thanks from my constituents 
in Indiana's Second District. You have helped--in the five 
years I have been here, you have been able to mitigate and help 
somewhere over 90 percent of the questions that we have had. 
And I am very, very grateful to you for what you have done. You 
have probably seen everything in 16 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">So I just wanted to pick up on what you said that you 
learned from the hearings that you guys had on the issues of ID 
theft, tax fraud, and scams. That is what we really get 
burdened by, folks in our district that have gotten caught in 
these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">And my question is this: On this Return Review Program, the 
RRP, that started in 2009, this thing has tended to end up to 
be like a boondoggle. I just kind of wanted to hear from you on 
its predecessor, the Electronic Fraud Detection System, or the 
EFDS, which, in 2010, the IRS said was too risky to maintain, 
upgrade, or operate beyond 2015. But here we are in 2017. The 
EFDS is still the principal fraud detection system, because the 
RRP still isn't ready for prime time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">In fact, TIGTA said there is no estimated date for full 
implementation, and GAO estimates that the program has incurred 
over $86.5 million in cost overruns. So when the RRP has run as 
a pilot, it yielded a high false-positive rate, and it missed 
$313 million in fraudulent filings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">So let's set aside the numbers and stats and talk about the 
actual people behind them. You have documented well what 
taxpayers go through in your annual reports. But for the 
benefit of everyone here, can you walk us through what happens 
to a single mom, a small business owner, a person who either 
gets flagged as a false positive or a fraudulent return?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">    Can you just go through how do you find out what hoops they 
go through and what this really means to people?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Right. Depending on what system triggers them as
a suspected fraudulent return, they either get a letter or they 
are just--their refund is just held up and they have to call 
the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Ms. OLSON">If they get a letter, they are told that they have to 
verify themselves either online or they may have to go into a 
walk-in site. And to do that, they just can't walk in. There 
are no longer walk-in sites; they have to make an appointment. 
And sometimes you are told it might take weeks to get an 
appointment, and you won't be able to get your refund before 
you do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Ms. OLSON">And, then, even if you go through that, it may be that your 
return is stopped by some other filter once it goes back into 
the processing, so then you have to go through it all again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Identity theft and refund fraud have been the top two case 
receipts in TAS, Taxpayer Advocate Service, for the last 5 
years, and they really are a significant part of our inventory. 
It is devastating to people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    Mrs. WALORSKI. So aside from the time element and the 
frustration, does it not cost taxpayers money as well if they 
need to seek professional services to be their Advocate?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Well, absolutely. Absolutely. And this affects
people who are low income, high income. It doesn't matter. And 
people are having to get their preparers to call, and people 
often submit documentation multiple times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Ms. OLSON">There is no one person assigned to their case, so every 
time they call, they have to tell their story to a different 
person. These are all recommendations we have made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. OLSON">You know, the other thing on the filters is that we have 
recommended that the IRS create sort of a dedicated team during 
the filing season on the IT side. So as we start seeing filters 
that have very high false positive rates, that you have a team 
that can get in there and adjust those filters. Don't wait 
until later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Mrs. WALORSKI. I apologize about interrupting, but what 
about commercially available technology that is there? Is it 
your opinion that just from a commonsense perspective, this 
would be where we would move to with an unbelievable amount of 
errors in fraud and money that is being spent and this whole 
lack of accountability on the system?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    Would you not agree that that would be someplace that we 
could look at and say let's mitigate this as quickly as we can 
on behalf of the taxpayers?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Certainly, the financial sector has tried to
figure out about financial fraud and, you know, electronic 
fraud. And the IRS is meeting with those people. The 
commissioner established the security summit, and I think that 
is a significant step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Mrs. WALORSKI. I appreciate it. We are out of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    I yield back. And thanks again. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> I now recognize the gentlelady from
Washington, Ms. DelBene.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DELBENE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. DELBENE">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. DELBENE">And thank you, Ms. Olson, for being with us today and for 
all of your service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. DELBENE">    I wanted to talk to you about technology in particular, 
because you talked so much about that in your testimony and 
kind of the dire state that it is in right now. Can you give us 
a brief overview of how technology decisions are made at the 
IRS today, and kind of, briefly, whether you think the 
organizational chart is working well in terms of helping make 
those decisions?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Well, I think, you know, there are lots of
executive steering committees on the technology side that 
review the priorities of how the IRS is going to spend its 
money. And the IRS, in addition to the cybersecurity concerns 
that we have, which are very great, the major concern that we 
have got, in addition to the RRP system, which is our return 
fraud detection system, is our enterprise case management 
system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. OLSON">We have about over 60 systems, and they don't communicate 
with one another. And so employees have to get permission to 
get into things, and often they can't. It slows things down. It 
is manual. It is not virtual. Our case files aren't virtual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. OLSON">It is astonishing. And that is a heavy lift that the IRS, 
in my opinion, is very far behind on, but is finally 
beginning--after spending millions of dollars, to get up to 
speed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And then we have the fact that we are still on--we have the 
two oldest information systems in the Federal Government, 
according to GAO, where we are keeping our taxpayer information 
on. And that is a significant concern, getting from those 
systems to something that is 21st century is going to be a huge 
lift.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DELBENE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. DELBENE"> And I assume, when we talk about cyber having
old systems, that is very concerning, and it is concerning 
because access to information is so cumbersome, as you said, it 
slows down your ability--IRS's ability to do so its job.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DELBENE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. DELBENE"> Why do you think things have gotten so bad?
Why are we so outdated?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. OLSON">My personal opinion, from observing it while I
have tried to develop my own case management system for my own 
employees, is that partly, we don't have the talent inside the 
IRS. We haven't been able to recruit the people that we need 
to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And then I think that there is not enough communication 
between the IT function and the business operating divisions 
who are going to use these systems, so that things go--get 
developed that actually aren't what the operating divisions 
need, but then the operating divisions don't have a chance to 
tell that. And then money gets wasted, and I have seen that a 
lot.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DELBENE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. DELBENE"> You know, I think that is a common problem
that we have seen in technology implementations in government 
generally and something we need to continue to focus on. Do you 
have current modernization plans within the IRS that you think 
are going to help address these issues?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I think particularly for the ECM, the IRS has
just put out a request for information to hear from off-the-
shelf products that are doing a case management system to see 
what is out there, and then they will build to request for a 
proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I think that is the appropriate approach to really get a 
sense of the universe, instead of focusing on one thing that 
turns out not to be good, but we have invested $80 million in 
it or something like that. So they are finally on the right 
track in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    They do need more funding to be able to bring in the 
talent, but they also need more oversight from you all so that 
you all are understanding that that funding is being spent 
appropriately.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. DELBENE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. DELBENE">Thank you so much. My time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. DELBENE">    I yield back, Mr. Chair.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">    I now recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. 
Meehan.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MEEHAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN">And thank you, Ms. Olson, for your work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN">Ms. Olson, oftentimes, the IRS has a direct relationship 
with taxpayers because it relates to the taxpayer paying his or 
her taxes. But they serve another role, and it implicates a lot 
of people in which the information that one puts into his or 
her IRS tax return is relevant for another purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN">And I speak to something which is touching families all 
across America today, and that is, college applications, 
including for financial aid. And so as colleges and 
universities interact with their students, they are reliant on 
the ability for the applicants to let people know what their 
financial status is, and that means they need to get into IRS 
databases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN">Outward facing tools have been used by the IRS so that I 
authenticate who I am, and then you allow me to go back into my 
tax return and forward that information onto my financial aid 
application. As a parent who has gone through this process--and 
I know I am speaking for many--it is so incredibly frustrating 
to begin with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN">But now, we are seeing that this system, which has 
purportedly been put in place, the outward-facing tools, has 
actually been compromised. Hundreds of thousands of Americans 
trying to make this application have found that their 
identities have been stolen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN">And as a result, now we not only can't utilize the tool, 
but you have people who are trying to make those applications 
who are now frustrated, feeling time deadlines for applying to 
their schools, don't know where to go to get the information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN">And it is particularly egregious because oftentimes, the 
very people making these applications, may be a student who 
doesn't know the information that his or her parents have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN">    Can you speak to me about the outward-facing tools that the 
IRS is using, what you know about this compromised situation, 
about what the IRS is doing to make that taxpayer relationship 
move more slowly--flow more appropriately.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Well, first, the information the IRS has is such
a valuable asset of the Federal Government and the taxpayers of 
the United States that we have to make sure that it is 
protected in every way possible. And that means that there has 
to be very high--high-level screens for people to authenticate 
who they are, because identity thieves are very sophisticated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And last year, the IRS learned that there were risks to the 
way that people were getting access to IRS data through this 
FAFSA system. And while they tried to work with the Department 
of Education over time, they learned that what the IRS needed 
for the protection of that data, the Department of Education 
couldn't put into their system. And they had to make--they gave 
several workarounds, and those workarounds weren't able to be 
implemented by the DOE.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MEEHAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN"> Was the problem on the Department of Education
part?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Ms. OLSON">It was my understanding it was on the level of,
you know, the types of systems that DOE has, and we were 
setting very high standards for access to that information. And 
so the IRS had to--really felt, according to their risk 
analysis, that they had to stand down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And now they have just put it back up again. They have 
worked through some issues. But I think that it is going--this 
is where you have some difficulty where you have one agency and 
the another agency, and you need to get them together.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MEEHAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN"> Well, what is your sense? Is the Department of
Education collaborating and cooperating with the IRS?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> I think they are now, and I think--this is my
personal opinion, but I think they are now. I think it is a 
matter of technology. But it is also that I think they didn't 
understand initially the level of concern that we have about 
people getting access to this incredibly important data and 
misusing it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MEEHAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN"> Well, thank you. I would ask for your
continuing oversight on that particular issue, because as we 
speak, millions of Americans----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Certainly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    Mr. MEEHAN [continuing]. Are dealing with this very 
frustrating system. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Certainly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MEEHAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. MEEHAN"> I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> I now recognize the gentleman from
Connecticut, Mr. Larson.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LARSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. LARSON">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I especially
appreciate the opportunity to meet the committee. I want to 
thank you and Mr. Lewis for this opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. LARSON">Ms. Olson, I have nothing but great respect and admiration 
for you and the job that you have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. LARSON">Representative Courtney and myself have been dealing with 
an issue, along with Representative Neal up in New England, 
that deals with foundation crumbling, not dissimilar to a case 
that happened many years ago in the south with what they 
referred to as a Chinese drywall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. LARSON">And in both cases, the circumstances are that, through no 
fault of the individual, they all of a sudden find themselves 
in a situation in the case of Connecticut where their 
foundations are crumbling. There is no insurance coverage. And 
so we are pursuing relief--in this case, from the IRS, to use 
this as a casualty loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. LARSON">And as I said, there is ample precedent for this in the 
China drywall situation. And our initial discussions with both 
the Commissioner and Secretary Mnuchin have been very positive, 
but--and we also know that in Connecticut, the Taxpayer 
Advocate Service has been incredibly supportive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. LARSON">    Any advice or recommendations, and could we beseech you for 
the support of the National Taxpayer Advocate?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Well, I have been aware of this problem and had
my staff attorneys meet with chief counsel attorneys of the IRS 
to look at the law pertaining to casualty loss deductions and 
why it--how it could apply in this instance. And just this 
week, we submitted to the IRS chief counsel a request for 
priority guidance that they put this issue on their priority 
guidance plan to give guidance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And we have actually--it wasn't just a request, we pointed 
out how they could do it to grant relief to these taxpayers. 
And I will be more than happy to share that request with you so 
you can see what we wrote up.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LARSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. LARSON">I would be delighted to receive that. And we
appreciate your continued advocacy. And as I said earlier, this 
is something that impacts people, and now it is estimated that 
more than 30,000 people in Connecticut will be impacted by 
this. But the straining actually runs from Canada all the way 
down to the Sound, so we are trying to forewarn people as well 
with this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. LARSON">    But I can't thank you enough as well as both the 
cooperation that we have received today from the IRS and 
Treasury. And I view that, in large part, because of your 
involvement and the Taxpayer Advocate Service involvement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LARSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. LARSON"> With that, Mr. Chairman, I would--I would just
like to also ask you at some point--not for here--but I would 
love to get your opinion on the Japanese system of collecting 
and simplifying their Tax Code and what opinions you might have 
on that. That is not a question for here, but perhaps later I 
could follow up with you on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Certainly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LARSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. LARSON"> With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank the committee
for indulging me and yield back my time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Anytime, Mr. Larson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">    I now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. 
Holding.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. HOLDING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. HOLDING">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. HOLDING">Ms. Olson, I would like to ask you about a subject that 
came up at one of your public forums last year. A tax 
practitioner in Red Oak, Iowa, raised concerns about 
statistical audits, meaning audits that are done for research 
purposes by the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. HOLDING">    And although you acknowledge the importance of these 
research audits, you also recognize that they can be painful 
for taxpayers, and you even described the taxpayer under audit 
as, quote, ``a guinea pig.'' So I have significant concerns 
about these audits. You mentioned a couple of potential 
solutions at the forum last year. At the time, you said you had 
only been discussing these options internally. So has your 
thinking evolved any on these suggestions?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. OLSON">So, you know, the audit--as a representative--I
represented taxpayers for 27 years, and as a representative, I 
had to sit through the predecessor to these audits, the tax 
compliance measurement program. And it was expensive and 
painful for the taxpayer, painful for the representative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. OLSON">But I also recognize the importance of these audits so that 
we don't go out and willy-nilly audit people that shouldn't be 
audited. You know, we need some kind of statistical gathering 
thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. OLSON">And my thinking about these taxpayers being guinea pigs is 
that they are actually doing a service for the public. These 
are random audits. There may be nothing wrong with their 
returns at the end of the day, but the IRS is using it for data 
gathering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And so if they are doing that public service, they should 
be paid. And either that or either/and maybe we don't assess 
the tax at the end of the audit. You know, we found the errors, 
but they have sat through this for the public good, and so 
maybe we don't assess the tax that we found. Or we give them 
compensation for sitting through it. And I would suggest that 
that compensation be nontaxable so we don't, you know----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. HOLDING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. HOLDING">Well, let me ask you this: Yesterday, GAO
released a report on the national research program and 
employment taxes. And the GAO concluded that the IRS doesn't 
even have a formal plan to timely analyze, let alone actually 
use, the data it collected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. HOLDING">    So do you believe the IRS should continue to subject 
taxpayers, in your words, guinea pigs, to these burdensome, 
random audits if there is no plan to even use the information? 
And shouldn't the IRS actually use the data? If it is going to 
pay folks for the data, you know, of your suggestion, shouldn't 
they use it or shouldn't they just shut down the program? I 
mean, if GAO says there is no plan to even use it. So that is 
kind of doubly disturbing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Yeah. I don't think they should shut down the
program. I mean, they need to use the data. And I will look 
very carefully at the GAO audit, because I think GAO--that 
gives a plan for how the IRS could use it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    I think the IRS needs to be an organization that uses the 
data that it has. And often, it doesn't develop strategies 
based on the data or it takes a long time to get it into 
operation, and that is just inexcusable.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. HOLDING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. HOLDING"> Well, listening to your answer to Ms.
DelBene's question on technology in the IRS, it seems like the 
IRS has difficulty with technology just in its basic functions, 
and this is something above its basic function. And it makes 
it, perhaps, triply disturbing now that Ms. DelBene asked the 
probing question.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> I think that the IRS is challenged in a lot of
ways. I do believe that----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. HOLDING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. HOLDING"> That is the understatement of the day.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. HOLDING</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. HOLDING"> Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman
from New York, Mr. Crowley.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. CROWLEY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. CROWLEY">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding
this hearing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. CROWLEY">Thank you, Ms. Olson, for participating here, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. CROWLEY">    Ms. Olson, recently, my good friend and colleague, John 
Lewis, introduced a bill, the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2017, 
which I am a cosponsor of, to repeal the private debt 
collection program. Do you think the IRS should outsource 
Federal tax collection, and should a new IRS have the authority 
to do this, hire private companies to collect unpaid taxes?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Well, it is my personal and professional opinion
that the collection of tax is an inherently governmental 
function, because it requires the exercise of judgment and 
discretion to do it right, and take into consideration the 
facts and circumstances of taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    But Congress has made the decision to create this 
outsourcing, and now, my focus has been on how the IRS is 
implementing this provision. And I have a lot of concerns about 
how it is being implemented.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. CROWLEY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. CROWLEY"> For for-profit motive. Is that it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I think that is part of the fundamental flaw
with the program, that at least whatever you say about IRS--I 
mean, I think that IRS collection employees understand that the 
goal of collection is to bring taxpayers into voluntary 
compliance. And that may mean that you are focusing on the 
future that they be able to pay going forward, and will deal 
with their debt later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And the private debt collectors have the incentive to 
collect tax, just the amount that is before them, and get their 
commission. They don't--they would have no incentive to think 
about voluntary compliance going forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. CROWLEY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. CROWLEY">The consequence as it pertains to the taxpayer
as well. Kind of, in my mind, my concern about criminal justice 
reform and privatizing of prisons, you know, you create beds. 
They need to fill them. That is how they get paid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. CROWLEY">    In terms of the EITC, I know there has been a great deal of 
concern about fraud existing within the program itself. I would 
like to get your thoughts in terms of how much is really fraud 
and how much is basically mistakes that are made in terms of 
filling out the proper requisite papers.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Well----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. CROWLEY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. CROWLEY">Hank Paulson, for instance, I went into
Goldman Sachs, he filed and he did it wrong, just to 
demonstrate, even the most brilliant, so to speak, can make 
mistakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. CROWLEY">    What recs do you have to make it an even more efficient--
and more accessible and more efficient as well?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Right. Well, this year, in my annual report to
Congress, I made a legislative recommendation that was really 
designed around trying to minimize the errors and fraud in the 
EITC, and we have attached it to my testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I do think that most of the errors are attributable to the 
complexity of the law, but the complexity of the law also 
creates opportunities for others to game it. And a lot of the 
fraud, the pure fraud, comes from some unregulated preparers 
that, you know, are preying upon an unsophisticated population 
and selling them something that is too good to be true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    So you have got a lot of different things playing around 
there. But I believe that there are things that you can do, 
both administratively and legislatively, to minimize the 
improper payments. Some of that is going to the design, and 
others are going into the kind of both outreach and education 
and oversight that the IRS needs to do on this issue.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. CROWLEY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. CROWLEY"> Thank you. I think for the integrity of the
program itself, we need to be vigilant, mindful, but also 
understand, I think, the complexities in terms of the 
clientele----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Yeah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Mr. CROWLEY [continuing]. And their ability to actually 
fill out those forms properly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Ms. OLSON">And, Mr. Chairman, just let me thank you for holding this 
hearing today as well in a very bipartisan spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Mr. Roskam and I have been working together on issues in 
relation to taxpayers' relationship with the IRS. We know it is 
not always pleasant. We know you all don't always get it right, 
and that is why I think we need a Congress, a vigilant 
Congress, Mr. Chairman, and a committee like this to keep an 
eye on it to help you do your job, help us do our job, but 
help, most importantly, protect the interest of our 
constituents, the U.S. taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    So, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">I now recognize the gentlelady from Tennessee, Mrs. Black.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Mrs. BLACK. I thank the Chairman. I thank you for allowing 
me to sit in on the Subcommittee, although I am not a Member of 
the Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">But, Ms. Olson, I want to thank you for the work that you 
and your folks do at your agency. And as you said at the 
beginning of your comments that most people do want to pay 
their fair share and just to be left alone. They understand 
that they have a responsibility to pay their taxes. The U.S. 
has about 98 percent of voluntary tax compliance rate and has 
always been linked to be perceived fair and impartial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">But in the most recent years, we have seen more of that 
impartiality, and I think that that is part of what we are 
seeing in the general population, that they have really lost 
trust in the IRS. So your agency is particularly important for 
helping us to be sure that we do at least have one reach into 
helping with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">One of the things that I wanted to go to is, of course, the 
complexity of the Tax Code doesn't help, and that is up to 
Congress to reform the Tax Code so that it can be something 
much simpler, which we are working on on our side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">But the IRS is also a unique creature in that it doesn't 
really have a regulatory process like other Federal agencies 
do. And so they issued these guidances, and they don't solicit 
any public comments like you would in a Federal agency where 
there would be a change and there would be an opportunity for 
those public comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">And, in fact, on the IRS website, it actually has a section 
that says, ``Understand the IRS guidance. '' And it has seven 
kinds of guidance to taxpayers that they should be familiar 
with. And I will note the irony of this is that the IRS 
actually acknowledges within that statement that they say, and 
I quote, ``It may be puzzling and a mystery.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">    And so I wanted to ask you to talk a little bit about those 
guidances and what we can do to keep that from happening, and 
how that actually rolls out and takes place?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Ms. OLSON">The IRS has many different types of guidances
you point out, and some of them do go through the 
Administrative Procedure Act, you know, notice and comment, the 
regulations that we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Ms. OLSON">But it has--you know, it believes that getting out guidance 
is helpful to taxpayers. And, so, rather than going through 
what it views as the cumbersome regulatory process, which would 
require notice and comment, it does stuff to get out guidance 
faster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Ms. OLSON">The downside about that is, as you say, there is no vehicle 
that they have designed for public comment on that. That 
doesn't mean you couldn't do it that way, but they don't. And I 
am very concerned about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I am even more concerned--and I have written about this as 
a most serious problem--that they are moving more toward FAQs, 
you know, which are great in the sense that you get things up 
quickly, but you can't tell when a change has been made in the 
FAQ unless you print out the FAQ every single day and track it 
word for word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Ms. OLSON">And they are not reliable, so that if you say you rely on 
an FAQ, and then the IRS says, Well, that is wrong, that is no 
defense. So you are--and as that gets done more, you are really 
leaving the taxpayer in a very vulnerable situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Mrs. BLACK. And I want to reference that that is one of the 
things that I hear from my constituents is they call into to 
get the guidance, and they give the guidance, and they ask, can 
you please send me an email or something that I can use to 
verify if I use what your recommendations are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And the IRS will refuse to send them anything in writing. 
And this, to me, is a really big problem, where people are 
trying so hard to do it the right way, and then they get caught 
on it. And they say, ``But I called in, and I asked a 
question,'' and what they got from the IRS was, ``We cannot 
give you that in writing.''
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    Mrs. BLACK. And so I see this as a big area that has to be 
looked at. And I appreciate you being here today and, again, 
thank you----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I am very happy to work with you on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    Mrs. BLACK. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> I now recognize the gentleman from
Michigan, Mr. Bishop.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. BISHOP">Good morning. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, for the hearing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. BISHOP">I am looking at--the IRS is responsible for processing 
approximately 150 million tax returns every year, issuing 
refunds to taxpayers for about 70 percent of those 150 million 
tax returns. According to the IRS estimates, it says that the 
cost for a refund check is about a dollar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. BISHOP">    And I am wondering what the cost would be for a direct 
deposit--instead of a check, and also, how we might address 
that issue, the cost and the time using prepaid debit cards, 
and whether or not the IRS uses, for the tax returns, the debit 
express cards.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Ms. OLSON">You know, this is something we identified in my
annual report this year, is that it is so much--and it is so 
less expensive to do direct deposit, and then we have a large 
part of our population that is un-banked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Ms. OLSON">And, so, rather than them going through check cashing 
places, et cetera, if they are already participants in this 
direct express program that is run by Treasury, why couldn't we 
put tax refunds on it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And, frankly, I am baffled why we don't do it. The Treasury 
can negotiate very good rates and charges. They already have 
this product. And it just makes sense. So I really don't have a 
good answer for you. That is why we made it a most serious 
problem: Why aren't we using it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"> So doesn't that open this wide open for fraud
if we don't utilize this system?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Well, I think the concern about the fraud is
obviated by the fact that people have to go to a bank to prove 
their identity. So you have all the PATRIOT Act requirements 
that were put in about proving your identity to open a bank 
account, and that is what they have to do for direct express. 
It is actually much more than what they would have to do to 
just get a card from, you know, some check cashing place.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"> That is assuming that you could use that
product for the refund.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"> But we now use prepaid debit cards that don't
have to go through that process.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Exactly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"> So that is what I am talking about to expose
yourself to fraud; whereas, if we utilized it at the direct 
express debit card, we wouldn't have that problem.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Right, exactly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"> Has there been any discussion about allowing
taxpayers to use prepaid debit cards for tax payments?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> For payments?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I think that they can, actually. If they
haven't, then the IRS is working on that to accept that online. 
They are really trying to work on the different ways that you 
can make electronic payments online directly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    Part of the problem, though, is they now have on their 
online account you can make those payments, but you do have to 
be able to sign on as a taxpayer, and some of the security is 
very, very high for that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"> What is the cost to process a check from a
taxpayer?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> You had said a dollar. I don't have that
information right here, but I can get you it between the check 
versus direct deposit versus a debit card.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. BISHOP"> We can agree it would probably be significant
savings?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Oh, significantly less--yeah.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BISHOP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. BISHOP">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. BISHOP">    And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Ms. Olson, I want to thank you upfront for your leadership 
and service over a lot of years. Like I said, I have heard a 
lot of good things. But I have got a litany of things I wanted 
to run down and touch on. We have got a few minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">    Identity theft. It has been huge in Florida. A CPA is 
coming to me--I think the CPA even had maybe his identity 
stolen. And I have got to tell you, to be candid about it, I 
think this is more, maybe two or three years ago, two years 
ago. It seems like it is a little better today, but I would 
like to get your take on where are we at with identity theft?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Ms. OLSON">I think it is going better than it has been. The
IRS has improved its processes somewhat. But three things have 
happened that have really made a difference: One is the 
legislation that you all passed, getting us the W-2 information 
by January 31, because that lets us be--if we can get the 
employer W-2s, we can see which is the legitimate W-2 versus 
the altered, fake W-2.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Ms. OLSON">The other thing that is happening is that the IRS is now, 
you know, requiring the software companies to ask for driver's 
licenses when they are filing electronic returns, and that 
really helps us identify whether this is a legitimate taxpayer 
or an identity thief, in many instances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And the third thing is there is a program that we are 
trying to get more and more employers to use where there is a 
code that is unique to that taxpayer's W-2 from that employer. 
And when they go to file electronically, if that code is put 
in, then we can tell that this is the correct W-2 and it is not 
an identity theft W-2.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> Let me ask you, just for the sake of
time, you know, how many of the criminals, or the syndicates, 
are outside the U.S.? Do you have any sense of that? Someone 
claims a lot of this is done by Russia and others----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> I really don't know. The criminal investigation
division is working with so many other enforcement agencies to 
really monitor that. And, you know, it is so hard to track this 
stuff down.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> Because you say there is a bunch in the
States, but you also hear that it is outside the country----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Ms. OLSON">You hear about India and elsewhere, yeah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Chairman BUCHANAN [continuing]. Different organizations, 
Eastern bloc countries or something like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    Mr. Crowley brought up earned income tax credit. I know 
there are some complications probably in filing, but 24 percent 
fraud, tens of billions of dollars, I guess, a year. What is 
your take on that? I mean, why is it we can't seem to improve 
it somewhat? Is it lack of resources to educate people? I am 
sure that is part of it. He asked how much that was a part of 
it, but I was curious, just from your standpoint, where are we 
at on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> I don't think there is any one thing we can do
to bring that rate down. I think it is a sum of multiple 
things: It is education; it is doing really specific audits on 
it; it is doing other kinds of compliance activities; and it is 
doing a redesign of the provisions. Knowing what we know about 
where the errors and fraud are, we can change the design a 
little bit legislatively.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> Does it make sense to have higher
standards for preparers, do you think, a lot of people are 
doing a lot of this work? Would that make a difference, 
education, training, and maybe some licensing?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> I do think there would have to be minimum
competency standards for preparers, primarily in the EITC area, 
because that is where we see--we know that the unregulated, 
unaffiliated preparers, not with the large preparation firms, 
are the greatest source of errors for the EITC population in 
the preparer base.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> Now, you were here, I think, 20 years
ago, at the IRS. Were you here then when they did the IRS 
reforms?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> I was actually a witness before this committee
as the representative of a low-income taxpayer clinic.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> Okay. In your thought, it seemed like
that made a big difference. I thought I heard you say that in 
your testimony. So in terms of where we are at today, it sure 
seems like 20 years, we could work together on a bipartisan 
basis to make some real reforms that make a big difference to 
the country. Do you think--you agree with that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Ms. OLSON"> Yes. And I think the way that it was done in
1998, where you heard from a diverse group of people, internal 
and external, experts in government, experts in business, you 
know, it made an incredible record. And when you read those 
hearings again, they are just very impressive.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Well, we want to work with you and get
all the stakeholders at multiple hearings. We are going down 
the road to see if we can't make a difference in that space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">    One other thing that has come up, or a couple of things 
that have come up in our area, is small business disputes. They 
seem like--it is usually sometimes not a lot of money, but it 
is a dispute. But they could end up spending more in 
professional fees and outsiders than just paying the check 
itself. Where are we at on that, or what is your sense of that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Ms. OLSON">You know, I think that that raises the issue of
not just the audit side where there are these disputes, but the 
appeals function. And that, again, is one of my concerns that 
the IRS has moved to a more centralized, remote, impersonal 
appeals function, which really was the safety valve for small 
businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    There are 12 States that don't have an appeals officer in 
them, so they don't understand the conditions of that State. 
And I think that it really takes--we should take a look at that 
appeals function and see how we really make it work as the 
safety valve that it was intended to be.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN"> And then my last question is just
protecting taxpayers' rights is a key foundation. What 
additional tools could you use to make you even more effective 
on behalf of taxpayers?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. OLSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Ms. OLSON">Yeah. I think--I have written about this in my
annual report. I have made recommendations about codifying, 
strengthening the taxpayer assistance order authority, and 
codifying something called the taxpayer advocate directive, 
where I can order the IRS to change its processes that would 
affect groups of taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. OLSON">    And those are very important tools. But right now, they are 
just--the taxpayer advocate directive is just administrative.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman BUCHANAN</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">Okay. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">I would like to thank our witness for appearing before us 
today. Please be advised that Members have two weeks to submit 
written questions to answer later in writing. Those questions 
and your answers will be made part of the formal hearing 
record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">With that, this Subcommittee stands adjourned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Chairman BUCHANAN">[Whereupon, at 9:58 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]</paragraph>
</Statement>
</Hearing>
