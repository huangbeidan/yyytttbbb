    <Statement>
    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARCO RUBIO, A U.S. SENATOR FROM</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. MARCO RUBIO"> FLORIDA; CHAIRMAN, CONGRESSIONAL-EXECUTIVE COMMISSION ON CHINA
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Rubio</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Welcome to the Congressional-Executive
Commission on China. The title of this hearing is ``Digital 
Authoritarianism and the Global Threat to Free Speech.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Chairman Rubio">We will have one panel testifying today. It will feature 
Sarah Cook, who is the senior research analyst for East Asia 
and editor of the China Media Bulletin, Freedom House; Clive 
Hamilton, who is a professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt 
University in Canberra, and author of ``Silent Invasion: 
China's Influence in Australia''; and Dr. Katrina Lantos Swett, 
president, Lantos Foundation for Human Rights &amp;amp; Justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Chairman Rubio">I want to thank all of you for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Chairman Rubio">I understand that Professor Hamilton has a speaking 
engagement at the State Department immediately following this 
hearing, so once the testimony has concluded, commissioners 
will take a few minutes to ask him any questions they have and 
then we will return to the rest of the Q &amp;amp; A.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Chairman Rubio">The topic, of course, of today's hearing is freedom of 
expression and China's pervasive and unrelenting efforts to 
stifle speech at home and now increasingly abroad. And so it's 
timely and it's important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Chairman Rubio">We have long known of the Chinese Communist Party's massive 
censorship regime and suppression of free speech and expression 
within its own borders. The Commission's political prisoner 
database testifies to the human toll of the Chinese Communist 
Party's repression in this regard. But now the party is 
increasingly exporting its authoritarianism abroad, trying to 
suppress speech, stifle free inquiry, and seeking to control 
narratives around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Chairman Rubio">America and other like-minded nations must contend with 
this long arm of China and the growing threat it poses to our 
open democratic systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Chairman Rubio">With the conclusion of last month's 2018 National People's 
Congress, the Chinese president and Communist Party general 
secretary emerged newly empowered and emboldened, no longer 
tethered by term limits, and overseeing a noteworthy expansion 
of Communist Party control over every aspect of China. These 
institutional developments reinforce his directives to Chinese 
media outlets to exhibit absolute loyalty to the party and his 
declaration in 2016 that all media must be surnamed ``Party'' 
and convey positive news about China in conformity with the 
party's ideology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Chairman Rubio">China's vast censorship regime is without parallel. Freedom 
House's 2017 ``Freedom on the Net'' report named China the 
world's worst abuser of internet freedom for the third 
consecutive year. And the Commission's most recent annual 
report noted ``the increased tension and criminal prosecution 
of citizen journalists who are a key source of information on 
labor protests, petitioning the government for redress of 
grievances, and other rights defense efforts.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Chairman Rubio">These detentions hinder the ability of those of us outside 
of China to know what is happening inside the world's most 
populous nation. Foreign journalists face restrictions and 
harassment, including physical abuse, physical and online 
surveillance, denying or threatening to deny reporters' visas, 
restricting their access to certain areas of the country, and 
harassment of sources and news assistants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Restrictions on expression are not limited to journalists. 
A State Department travel advisory that was issued in January 
of this year warned of the following: ``Security personnel have 
detained and/or deported U.S. citizens for sending private 
electronic messages critical of the Chinese government.'' The 
latter point underscores China's surveillance efforts, which 
feature prominently in any discussion of government censorship 
or curbs on free expression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Chairman Rubio">The Xinjiang-Uyghur Autonomous Region is an incubator of 
sorts where authorities have pursued invasive and involuntary 
collection of personal data that includes DNA and fingerprints 
from individuals. And it has all been implemented--the 
widespread use of facial recognition systems--all set against 
the backdrop of the detention of thousands of Muslims in 
political re-education centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Nationwide, the Chinese government is in the process of 
implementing a social credit system which, if successful, will 
track and compile data on every Chinese citizen and possibly 
even rank them based on their behavior, including their online 
speech. In fact, there was an open-source report yesterday 
about an individual, the first one banned from traveling 
because of his ``score'' or profile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Made possible by the massive collection of citizens' data 
and a growing network of hundreds of thousands of surveillance 
cameras, as well as voice and facial recognition capabilities, 
experts anticipate the system will be used to punish those 
viewed insufficiently loyal to the Communist Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Any discussion of censorship and surveillance invariably 
turns to technology. Foreign technology firms, many of them 
household names here in America, are clamoring, begging to have 
access to the vast Chinese market or, for those already there, 
are increasingly willing to make Faustian bargains in pursuit 
of their bottom line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Consider, for example, Apple. In February, it transferred 
its cloud data in China to servers inside of China that are run 
by a state-owned Chinese firm in order to comply with last 
year's cybersecurity law. And yet, we see its CEO at 
international forums basically touting the great partnership 
with China and thanking them for their openness while sometimes 
being critical of our own country. And when this sort of 
compliance to these sorts of laws leads to complicity and 
rights abuses, it cannot simply be business as usual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Look beyond China. It seems that not a week goes by without 
some story of China's long arm threatening free and open 
society, as Professor Hamilton can no doubt attest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman Rubio">A key element in the Chinese government's long-arm efforts 
is focused on information technology and the internet and 
internet governance or sovereignty. They assert national 
control of the internet and social media platforms, not only in 
recent domestic cyber legislation and development plans, but 
also at international gatherings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Additionally, there are growing examples of attempts by the 
Chinese government to guide, buy, or coerce political influence 
and control discussion of what they deem sensitive topics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Chairman Rubio">China's Great Firewall, grave rights violations in ethnic 
minority regions, arrests of citizen journalists and rights 
lawyers, suppression of speech--these are the familiar markings 
of an authoritarian one-party state. But to the extent that the 
same authoritarian impulses animate the Chinese government and 
Party's efforts abroad, including inside the United States, it 
directly threatens our most deeply held values and our national 
interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Chairman Rubio">So I look forward to today's testimony. I regret that a 
previously scheduled witness, Mr. Roy Jones, an American worker 
who was fired from his job at Marriott for inadvertently 
``liking'' a tweet posted by a pro-Tibet group, is unable to 
join us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Chairman Rubio">His story, which has now been well documented, is a painful 
and poignant reminder of the Chinese Communist Party's long 
arm, of their ability to coerce and get witting or unwitting 
cooperation from American corporations and companies who are 
interested in protecting their market status in China, even if 
it means firing an American worker the way Marriott did because 
he ``liked'' a tweet or a post about Tibet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Chairman Rubio">There are very real costs involved if we fail to confront 
China's pernicious authoritarianism at home and increasingly, 
abroad. And if we fail to address it, Americans here at home 
and those of us who love democracy and freedom around the 
world, including many of our allies in Europe and Australia and 
the Asia-Pacific region, could find ourselves living in a world 
where we work somewhere or live somewhere where we cannot speak 
freely without losing our job or some other benefit, because 
who we work for or who controls us is not ourselves but a 
foreign government that uses the leverage of access to its 
market in order to reach here and impact one of our most 
cherished principles.</paragraph>

    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH, A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">At this time, I would like to recognize the Cochairman for 
his comments.
 NEW JERSEY; COCHAIRMAN, CONGRESSIONAL-EXECUTIVE COMMISSION ON</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">Cochairman Smith. Thank you very much, Chairman Rubio, and 
thank you for your leadership and a very powerful statement and 
for convening this extremely important and timely hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">China, as we all know, has the world's largest number of 
internet users as well as the most sophisticated and aggressive 
internet censorship and control regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">I would remind my colleagues that back on February 15, 
2006, I convened a hearing, the beginning of a series of 
hearings. This one was called ``The Internet in China: Tool for 
Freedom or Suppression?'' Well, the jury's in--it's not a tool 
for freedom, it's a tool for suppression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">Yes, some people are able to communicate and bypass some of 
the regulators, the people who are ubiquitous in trying to 
uncover and to, unfortunately, hurt the human rights movement 
there. But it has become, especially under Xi Jinping, a tool 
for massive suppression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">The Chinese government spends $10 billion on maintaining 
and improving their censorship apparatus. The U.S. Government 
has an annual internet freedom budget of $55 million. And 
Congress still has little idea as to how this money is being 
spent. And I know Ms. Lantos Swett is shaking her head because 
we and she have raised this issue so many times in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">Over the past year or so, Chinese companies were ordered to 
close websites that hosted discussions on the military, 
history, and international affairs, and crack down on illegal 
VPNs. Apple was forced to remove VPNs from China's app store.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">New regulations were announced restricting anonymity 
online. And the Chinese government rolled out impressive new 
censorship technologies censoring photos in one-to-one WeChat 
discussions and disrupting WhatsApp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">Beijing has also deployed facial--as you pointed out, Mr. 
Chairman--and voice recognition, artificial intelligence and 
other surveillance technologies throughout the country but 
particularly targeting the Uyghur ethnic minority where between 
500,000 and a million Uyghurs have been detained arbitrarily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">The Chinese government and the Communist Party's attempt to 
enforce and export a digital authoritarianism poses a direct 
threat to Chinese rights defenders and ethnic minorities and 
poses a direct challenge to the interests of the United States 
and the free international community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">The U.S. must recognize that we are engaged in a battle of 
ideas and a revitalized dictatorship--online, in the 
marketplace, and elsewhere--and we need to up our competitive 
strategies and our game to meet this very, very serious 
challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">The administration's national security strategy says quite 
clearly that the Chinese government and the Communist Party, 
along with Russia, seek to ``challenge American power, 
influence and interests, attempting to erode American security 
and prosperity. They are determined to make economies less free 
and less fair, to grow their militaries and to control 
information and data to repress their societies and expand 
their influence. The Chinese government and Communist Party are 
using economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, 
and implied military threats to persuade other states to heed 
their political and security agenda. China gathers and exploits 
data on an unrivaled scale and spreads features of its 
authoritarian system, including corruption and the use of 
surveillance.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">The Chinese government and the Communist Party want to 
shape a world that is antithetical to U.S. values and interests 
and to export their economic, political and censorship models 
globally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">In response, the U.S. and like-minded allies must stand 
resolutely for freedom of religion, fairer and freer trade, 
labor rights, an end to the coercive population control 
programs, freedom of navigation, the rule of law and freedom of 
expression, including online.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">A coherent and engaged internet freedom strategy must be a 
critical part of the U.S. diplomatic toolbox. This strategy 
should have at its core a commitment to protect fundamental 
freedoms, privacy, and promote the free flow of news and 
information. But it is not a matter of just having a strategy--
it should be the right one. The Bush and Obama administrations 
pursued cyber diplomacy, yet internet freedom has declined 
around the world, privacy is increasingly under threat, and the 
free flow of information has become more endangered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">The right strategy must start with some humility. 
Cyberspace is a place to spread democratic ideals and a place 
where criminals, extremists, corporations, traffickers, and 
governments exploit vulnerabilities with impunity. Online 
communication can convey our highest ideals and our worst 
fears. It can shine a light on repression and be the source of 
hatred, manipulation, fake news, coercion, and conflict. It can 
bring people together or it can push us apart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">Despite all of this, I agree with the NSS's conclusion 
which says, ``The internet is an American invention and it 
should reflect our values as it continues to transform the 
future for all nations and all generations. A strong, 
defensible cyber infrastructure fosters economic growth, 
protects our liberties and advances our national security.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">Central to a revitalized U.S. internet freedom strategy 
should be a priority to open gaping holes in China's Great 
Firewall. As we remember with Radio Free Europe years ago, it 
was not soundproof. I remember those ads when I was a kid 
growing up. Well, the Great Chinese Firewall can be penetrated, 
but it has to be a very focused and aggressive and smart 
strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">I am not confident that the policy of the Broadcasting 
Board of Governors or the State Department has met that test at 
all. I think there are certain goals we should prioritize in 
our internet freedom strategy, which would include, one, 
China's netizens require easy, reliable, and free access to 
uncensored information through anticensorship technologies so 
that anybody can freely access information regardless of their 
technical ability. Reliable solutions should work all the time, 
regardless of intensified crackdowns or major events like Party 
congresses or the June 4th anniversary of Tiananmen Square.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">Solutions should also present difficult choices for the 
Chinese authorities. If the authorities want to disrupt these 
solutions, then they must disrupt many online services which 
they would normally be hesitant and unlikely to block.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">Access to solutions should also come at no cost to Chinese 
netizens. The Chinese authorities often block access to payment 
providers, so even if Chinese can afford a circumvention 
solution, they cannot get past the censorship by their payment 
provider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">Holistic anticensorship solutions should be encouraged, 
including not just technical circumvention but also 
distribution of those tools--getting around Google Play being 
blocked and censorship in the Apple app store--helping others 
share anticensorship tools as well as content through messaging 
apps, social networks, and QR codes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">These are just a few examples. I could say to my colleagues 
that in years past, I introduced the Global Online Freedom Act. 
We're going to be reintroducing that shortly, updated and 
hopefully responsive. Unfortunately, it has been sent to 
several committees. While we have gotten it out of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, in the past, Ways and Means and Financial 
Services on the House side have been reluctant because of the 
pressure coming from the industries that weren't for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">I would note parenthetically as well that Google used to be 
against it and then midstream a couple of years ago came out in 
favor of it. So there is hope that we'll get some support 
there. But above all, I think we just need to pass that or 
something like it in the very near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="HON. CHRISTOPHER SMITH">    I yield back and I thank you.

    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Cook">The number of internet users in China reached an estimated 
772 million people as of the end of 2017. This figure puts the 
issues we are discussing today in perspective. They affect a 
group more than double the size of the population of the United 
States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Cook">Alongside this increased access to internet services, 
China's ruling Communist Party has developed a robust apparatus 
of censorship, manipulation, and surveillance. Although this 
system has long been the most multilayered and sophisticated 
control apparatus in the world, recent years have seen new 
waves of tightening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Cook">Over the past year and particularly since a new 
cybersecurity law came into effect last June, online censorship 
and surveillance have expanded dramatically alongside 
increasing arrests of Chinese citizens, particularly for 
content shared on the mobile instant messaging platform WeChat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Cook">Technical and regulatory innovation and experimentation is 
constantly under way. It is thus worth considering what the 
costs are of this tightening for various actors inside and 
outside China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Cook">Well, for Chinese netizens, the space for ordinary Chinese 
to obtain and share information on a wide range of political 
and even apolitical topics has noticeably shrunk. The risk of 
punishment for even facetious comments deemed unacceptable to 
the authorities has risen. These shifts affect hundreds of 
millions of users in China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Cook">For target populations, like activists or members of 
religious and ethnic minorities, the consequences are 
especially dire. Numerous lawyers, bloggers, Tibetan monks, 
Uyghur Muslims, Christians, and Falun Gong practitioners have 
been jailed for sharing, downloading, or accessing information 
online or via their mobile phones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Cook">For Chinese tech companies--well, Chinese technology 
companies try to serve their customers, but they are also 
required to monitor and delete massive amounts of user-
generated content in an ever-changing and arbitrary regulatory 
environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Cook">Over the past month, popular applications providing news or 
enabling the sharing of humorous content to tens of millions of 
users have been suspended or shut down for failing to 
``rectify'' their content sufficiently. These apps are now 
planning to hire thousands more internal censors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Cook">For foreign tech firms, as you know, many of the world's 
top technology and social media companies are restricted from 
providing services to Chinese users. Foreign companies that do 
operate in China or work with Chinese firms are forced to 
comply with censorship demands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Cook">LinkedIn restricts users from accessing profiles or posts 
by people outside China that contain politically sensitive 
information. Apple removed more than 600 applications from its 
mobile phone store that enabled Chinese users to access blocked 
websites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Cook">But foreign companies are also increasingly at risk of 
being complicit in politicized arrests or violations of user 
privacy. It's not only Apple that has transferred users' data 
to servers in China under data localization provisions in the 
cybersecurity law. Evernote is another U.S. company that has 
done so, in its case not with a company that is owned by the 
government, but with Tencent, which has been known to pass 
information to police in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Cook">Airbnb China recently alerted its hosts that it ``may 
disclose your information to Chinese government agencies 
without further notice to you.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Cook">And one of the biggest investors in the artificial 
intelligence firm SenseTime, which provides facial recognition 
to local police and at least one prison in China, is none other 
than U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Cook">Now for the Communist Party. Now, the Communist Party is 
leading the drive for increased internet controls to protect 
its hold on power, shield itself from criticism, and stop 
organized political opposition. But this project also comes 
with costs for the party in terms of legitimacy and even the 
effectiveness of censorship efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Cook">A new academic study found that after Instagram was blocked 
in 2014, users were more motivated to seek out tools to 
circumvent censorship and reach the platform. But along the 
way, they encountered a wide array of censored content they 
might not otherwise have seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Cook">More broadly, with each announcement of new restrictions 
that negatively affect millions of users, signs of public 
backlash are evident. The constitutional changes enacted last 
month that removed term limits for President Xi Jinping are a 
case in point. The sheer scale of censorship points to a 
sizeable contingent of Chinese citizens who disagreed with the 
move, and much of the dissent emerged in the form of ridicule 
aimed directly at Xi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Cook">The situation provoked many Chinese citizens who might 
otherwise consider themselves apolitical to begin expressing 
their worries about China's direction and looking for ways 
around censorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Cook">Despite these costs and periodic concessions to public 
outcry, it is hard to imagine any voluntary loosening of 
restrictions in the coming years. On the contrary, we are 
likely to see more tightening, more government demands for 
companies' cooperation, and more arrests of innocent users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Cook">The international community should be ready to respond to 
these trends. There are recommendations specifically for the 
U.S. Government included in my written testimony. But despite 
the Chinese government's ever-escalating efforts to censor and 
monitor internet use, steps by the United States and others can 
have a real impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Cook">And I would like to conclude with a quotation from an 
anonymous Chinese reader of our China Media Bulletin. ``I am a 
lower-class worker in Chinese society and I don't speak 
English. An independent Chinese media like you that does in-
depth reports about the situation in China gives me a better 
understanding of China's current situation and future 
development. I think the flow of information and freedom of 
speech are very important to China's future development. Birds 
in cages long to fly. Even if we can't fly out now, hearing the 
chirping of birds outside can still give us hope and faith.''</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF CLIVE HAMILTON, PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC ETHICS,</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="CLIVE HAMILTON">There we go.
   CHARLES STURT UNIVERSITY, CANBERRA, AND AUTHOR, ``SILENT</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="CLIVE HAMILTON">           INVASION: CHINA'S INFLUENCE IN AUSTRALIA''
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hamilton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Thanks, Chairman Rubio and Cochairman Smith.
I very much appreciate the opportunity to testify before the 
Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Australia, as perhaps you know, is at the forefront of 
Beijing's influence and interference efforts, with a view to 
breaking Australia away from the American alliance. If it can 
achieve that--so what happens in Australia is of crucial 
importance to us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Last November, as the finished manuscript of my book 
``Silent Invasion'' was about to go to the typesetter, my 
publisher, Allen &amp;amp; Unwin, notified me that it was pulling the 
book. The CEO wrote saying that, based on advice it had 
received, the company was reacting to ``potential threats to 
the book and the company from possible action by Beijing.'' He 
went on to write, ``The most serious of these threats was the 
very high chance of a vexatious defamation action against Allen 
&amp;amp; Unwin and possibly against you personally as well.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">The company's defamation lawyer had pointed out that it 
would not be possible to make further textual changes to the 
book that would protect the company from vexatious legal 
actions by Beijing's proxies in Australia, legal actions that 
would tie up the company in expensive legal action for months 
or even longer. The company had been spooked by recent 
defamation actions taken against major news organizations by 
so-called ``whales,'' a reference, I believe, to legal action 
taken by Chau Chak Wing, a Chinese-Australian billionaire 
resident in Guangdong, and Huang Xiangmo, a wealthy Chinese 
citizen residing in Sydney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Australia's domestic intelligence agency, ASIO, has warned 
the major political parties that they should not accept 
donations from these men because of their suspected links to 
the Chinese Communist Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">The defamation actions launched by these billionaires have 
had a chilling effect on reporting by news outlets in Australia 
and now on the book publishing industry. And I note that an 
editorial in The People's Daily a couple of months ago in 
effect endorsed the use of lawfare abroad, another instance of 
the Chinese Communist Party exploiting the institutions of 
democracy to undermine democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Allen &amp;amp; Unwin's decision to drop ``Silent Invasion'' was a 
deeply worrying affirmation of the argument of the book. No 
actual threats were made to the publisher, which, in a way, is 
more disturbing. The shadow cast by Beijing over Australia is 
now dark enough to frighten a respected publisher out of 
publishing a book critical of the Chinese Communist Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">The shadow has also frightened off the rest of the 
publishing industry. Even though the spiking of the book 
attracted headlines around the world, none of the major 
publishers showed any interest in publishing what would be 
``Silent Invasion.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">I worry about the message that has now been sent to China 
scholars in Australia. The message is: If you write a book 
critical of the Chinese Communist Party, you will have trouble 
finding a publisher. Already, China scholars have told me that 
they censor themselves in order not to jeopardize their visas 
to do research in China and so protect their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Recently, we have seen major Western publishers compromise 
academic freedom by censoring their publications at the 
insistence of Beijing. They did so to maintain access to the 
Chinese market. In the ``Silent Invasion'' case, the fear was 
not about what the CCP could do in China--cut off access to 
markets--but what the CCP could do in Australia--sponsor legal 
actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">The spiking of ``Silent Invasion'' represents perhaps the 
starkest attack on academic freedom in Australia in recent 
times. It attracted intense media interest and strong support 
from the public. However, throughout the saga, one sector 
remained silent: the universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">No representative organization or prominent vice 
chancellor, that is, president of the university, made any kind 
of statement supporting me, a professor apparently being 
targeted by a powerful foreign state because of his work. Yet 
three months later, in March of this year, in a submission to a 
parliamentary inquiry into the proposed new foreign 
interference laws, Universities Australia, the peak body 
representing universities in Australia, complained about the 
threat posed by the new laws to academic freedom. These are 
laws designed explicitly to prevent foreign powers from 
suppressing free speech in my country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Australian universities are now so closely tied into 
monetary flows and research links with China that they have 
forgotten the founding principles of the Western university and 
none more so, I might add, than the University of Sydney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">In my written statement I've outlined Beijing's attempts to 
intimidate me and punish those associated with ``Silent 
Invasion's launch, notably Mr. John Hu, a prominent Chinese-
Australian citizen who helped the Sydney launch of the book. 
The condemnations of me and my book are but a small part of a 
much larger strategy to emerge in recent times. Beijing is 
ramping up its rhetoric against Australia in a calibrated 
campaign of psychological warfare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Last week, the PLA navy challenged three Australian 
warships sailing through the South China Sea simply for being 
there, for being in open international waters. Beijing has 
scaled up its threats of economic harm unless Australia changes 
its anti-China policy. This psychological warfare is but stage 
one, with real punishments to follow, if needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">So, for Australia, this is what pushback feels like, at 
least in its early stages. When Australia stands up for its 
independence and democratic values and tells Beijing it will no 
longer tolerate interference in our domestic affairs, we expect 
it to react.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">For some in Australia, a mere expression of displeasure by 
the CCP is enough for them to buckle at the knees. There is no 
shortage of Beijing sympathizers and appeasers among 
Australia's elite, calling on Australian politicians, scholars, 
and commentators to tone down their rhetoric, as if the current 
strain in the relationship between the two nations were our 
fault rather than due to Beijing's campaign of subversion, 
cyber intrusion and harassment on the high seas. Former Prime 
Minister Kevin Rudd has recently joined in this blame-shifting 
with his criticisms of the Turnbull government for standing up 
to Beijing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">The next two years in Australia are vital. At present, the 
political will exists to respond to the CCP's influence and 
interference operations, notably through the new foreign 
interference legislation now before Parliament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">The CCP is mobilizing its proxies. And some among the 
elites are fighting back on its behalf. Business leaders are 
saying we must do nothing to upset Beijing. Elements of the 
Australian Labor Party, now in opposition, are attempting to 
have the proposed new laws blocked. And Beijing-friendly 
intellectuals and commentators are writing articles and open 
letters saying that there is no problem and that the criticisms 
of the CCP are in fact driven by racism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">So the situation hangs in the balance. If we fail now to 
put up defenses against the CCP's subversion, then the 
opportunity will probably not arise again because the influence 
in the party will have penetrated too deeply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">    Thank you.

</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF KATRINA LANTOS SWETT, PRESIDENT, LANTOS FOUNDATION</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Thank you. Dr. Lantos Swett, thank you for
being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">FOR HUMAN RIGHTS &amp;amp; JUSTICE</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Ms. Lantos Swett. Thank you. Good morning. I want to thank 
Senator Rubio and Congressman Smith for the invitation to 
participate in this hearing. And I want to commend you both for 
convening a hearing on such an important topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">I would ask that my full testimony, including relevant 
correspondence between the Internet Freedom Coalition that I am 
part of, and the State Department, BBG, and members of 
Congress, be included as part of the hearing record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">The French have a wonderful saying, ``Plus ca change, plus 
c'est la meme chose,'' the more things change, the more they 
remain the same. I could not help but think of this phrase as I 
prepared my remarks for today's hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Over 10 years ago, my late father, Tom Lantos, then 
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, held a hearing 
that crystallized the sad truth about the devastating moral 
compromises so many major companies and countries, including, 
at times, our own, are willing to make in order to appease the 
Chinese government and gain access to its vast markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">And I think perhaps that, Congressman Smith, you might have 
been at that hearing with my father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">At that time, the chief executive of Yahoo, Jerry Yang, was 
in my father's crosshairs that day over his company's 
cooperation in giving up the identity of a dissident 
journalist, Shi Tao, to the Chinese authorities. After Yahoo 
disclosed his identity to the government, Mr. Shi was sentenced 
to prison for 10 years for the crime of engaging in pro-
democracy activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">As these high-tech billionaires and technological whiz kids 
sat before him, my father, who came to this country as a 
penniless Holocaust survivor from Hungary, said, ``While 
technologically and financially you are giants, morally you are 
pygmies.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">On that memorable occasion, Jerry Yang felt so ``called 
out'' by my father's words that he actually turned around and 
publicly bowed in apology to Mr. Shi's weeping mother, who was 
seated behind him. It was a dramatic moment, to be sure, but 
most of the episodes of cowardly kowtowing and quiet 
collaboration with the bullies, the censors, and the 
persecutors within the Chinese Communist Party occur without 
public comment or scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Furthermore, as today's hearing demonstrates, China is not 
content with censoring and controlling its own citizens. It is 
using the immense power of its financial resources to reach 
every corner of the world in an effort to intimidate 
businesses, universities, publishers, hotel chains, religious 
institutions, human rights and democracy activists, and even 
governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">It pains me to have to say this, but right now, China is 
succeeding in this effort to a shocking degree. Even more 
shocking, later in my remarks I will expose why I feel our 
government is doing far too little in the way of internet 
freedom to truly help the people of China and those imprisoned 
in other repressive regimes around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">One of my fellow witnesses this morning, Mr. Hamilton, has 
had personal experience with the long arm of the Chinese 
government and their intimidation, and his testimony is a 
cautionary and chilling tale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Just as my father did back in 2007, we must use the power 
of public naming and shaming to try and restrain the worst 
impulses of businesses, other organizations, individuals, and 
even our own government agencies who seem all too willing to 
sell their precious birthright of free speech and democracy for 
a mess of Chinese pottage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">To be clear, I think we all recognize that the internet is 
not an unalloyed good when it comes to spreading ideas and 
expanding the borders of freedom and democracy. As Shakespeare 
memorably penned, ``The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, 
good and ill together.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">It is analogous to our intricate system of modern 
transportation. While we recognize that it contributes to 
pollution, congestion, disrupts the environment and, of course, 
makes possible terrible accidents involving injuries and 
fatalities, nonetheless, it is the indispensable circulatory 
system that makes possible our modern world of travel and 
commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Similarly, the internet, despite its ability to spread 
hate, disrupt elections, and propagate fake news, is 
indispensable to our modern system of global communication. And 
as such, it is central to freedom of expression everywhere in 
the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">That is why there was so much enthusiasm and energy eight 
years ago when then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
delivered a landmark speech on internet freedom. I was sitting 
in the audience that day and felt the surge of optimism as our 
nation's top diplomat laid out a robust vision of America's 
central role in tearing down what Secretary Clinton referred to 
as ``the Berlin Wall of our digital age.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Remember, I am the daughter of the only member of Congress 
who personally experienced the horrors of living under fascism 
of the right, the Nazis, and the totalitarianism of the left, 
the Communists. It is in my DNA to resist these authoritarian 
efforts to control free, uncensored access to knowledge. And 
I'm pretty sure, Senator Rubio and Congressman Smith, that it 
is in your DNA, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">The year after that speech, the Lantos Foundation played a 
leading role in redirecting a good part of our government's 
spending on internet freedom to the BBG. Prior to that, almost 
all funding was inside the State Department, and frankly, it 
led to situations where China was able to deftly use the U.S.'s 
efforts to open the internet and circumvent their ``Great 
Firewall'' as a diplomatic bargaining tool.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Clearly, as a human rights organization, we believe that 
access to the internet is a modern human right that should not 
be bargained away, so we sought a ``safer'' home for the 
funding and felt the BBG had enough independence to play a 
leading role in opening the internet across the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">In the early years of this adjustment in the way our 
government funded anti-censorship tools, internet freedom 
initiatives were not perfect, but our government was funding a 
number of technologies to provide open access and we were 
moving in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Today, it pains me to sit before you and express my deep 
disappointment and frustration with the actual results and the 
current commitment of our country's internet freedom policy. I 
have heard it said that if China herself had been in charge of 
America's internet freedom policy, it could hardly have been 
more favorable to China's interests. That is an extraordinarily 
harsh assessment, perhaps harsher than I myself would subscribe 
to, but let me tell you why I think it is not far off the mark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Perhaps the single most stunning example of the lengths to 
which China will go to create an information prison is the 
``Great Firewall,'' a massive government censorship apparatus 
that has been estimated to cost billions of dollars annually 
and to employ some 2 million people to police the internet use 
of its citizens. For this reason, many of us have long believed 
that firewall circumvention technologies must be a key 
component of any effective internet freedom strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Since 2011, the Lantos Foundation, as part of a broad 
internet freedom coalition, has urged Congress to direct the 
State Department through DRL and the BBG to provide robust 
funding to field-tested, scalable circumvention technologies. 
Recognizing that these technologies have the potential to 
provide safe and uncensored access to the internet for 
literally hundreds of millions of people in China and in other 
closed societies, Congress has responded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">In every recent appropriations bill, Congress has included 
language directing that not less than $50 million be spent to 
fund internet freedom programs, including, specifically, 
firewall circumvention technology. This simply has not 
happened. Call it willful ignorance, call it bureaucratic 
intransigence and obfuscation, call it what you will, but, in 
my view, both the State Department and the BBG have failed to 
faithfully implement the clearly expressed intent of Congress, 
that significant resources be dedicated to these large-scale 
firewall circumvention technologies, the ones China fears most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">They have funded freedom festivals and training and small-
scale technologies that are more directed to driving traffic to 
their own platforms, in the case of the BBG, than giving free, 
unfettered access to the vast world of the internet for the 
hundreds of millions of people trapped behind the digital 
curtain. They fund privacy and security apps that are very 
important for safety while on the net, but they forget that 
many cannot even access the internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Meanwhile, some of the most effective, proven technologies, 
the ones China fears the most, technologies that provide 
unfettered access to all, have received only modest funding and 
have had curious barriers placed in their paths, making it 
difficult, if not impossible to qualify for different grant 
proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">The cost to U.S. interests of these failures at the BBG and 
DRL were on vivid display during January of this year when 
protests broke out in Iran. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians 
took to the streets to protest economic hardship and the 
oppressive rule of the theocratic dictators. Among other 
repressive responses to this popular uprising, the Iranian 
government acted to block access to the internet. Sadly, 
because the BBG had earlier cut off all funding to some of the 
most effective circumvention technologies, our ability to help 
provide access to the outside world for those brave Iranians 
was greatly limited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Only a single U.S. government-funded large-scale 
circumvention technology was available at this moment of 
crisis. I consider this an inexcusable dereliction of duty. 
Certainly, the single for-profit vendor who was funded at the 
time did valuable work, but how many more people could have 
been helped had the BBG done the job Congress directed them to 
do?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">I confess I am baffled by the failure of both the State 
Department and the BBG to faithfully execute the directives 
that Congress has given them. When I have met with 
representatives at both agencies, they reassure me of their 
deep commitment to the goal of broadening access to internet 
freedom and of the intensity of their efforts to do so. The 
rhetoric is pleasant enough, but their words are not matched by 
their deeds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">When our coalition has attempted to drill down and get real 
facts about where they are directing their resources and why 
they are not funding proven technologies, we are most often met 
with obfuscation, opacity, and unfulfilled promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">During the midst of the Iranian protests, I met with the 
top leadership at the BBG and they personally pledged to me at 
that time that within three to four weeks at most, funding 
would be granted for technologies that could make access 
available to vastly increased numbers of users around the 
world. More than three months have passed since those meetings, 
and not only has no funding been approved, but the latest 
indications are that no funding will be approved. In fact, they 
just now issued a letter saying they will be issuing no funding 
at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the 
bureaucrats at DRL and the BBG are relying on what they think 
is Congress's inadequate attention span and limited expertise 
to get away with this pattern of ignoring your clearly 
expressed intent. What arrogance!</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">I am hoping and praying that you will prove them wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">This issue, internet firewall circumvention, desperately 
needs champions in Congress. We need leaders who will be 
vigilant and vigorous in demanding accountability from the 
agencies responsible for executing our government's internet 
freedom policies, leaders who will not be beguiled by soothing 
words and, rather than accept heartfelt protestations of good 
intentions, will demand results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">Above all, we need leaders who know that we must not pacify 
the oppressors but instead fortify and strengthen the brave 
dissidents and ordinary Chinese citizens who are risking 
everything in their pursuit of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">In other words, we need leaders who are not moral pygmies, 
but rather moral giants. I know that both of you are that kind 
of leader. And the Lantos Foundation, along with our internet 
freedom coalition partners, stands ready to assist you in any 
way possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="KATRINA LANTOS SWETT">    Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Rubio</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Thank you all for being here. As promised,
we are going to start with Professor Hamilton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Let me just set the stage briefly because people watch this 
issue and I think it's important to understand this context so 
they understand why it is that we are focusing on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Chairman Rubio">You know, 25, 30 years ago as China began to emerge as a 
participant in the global economy, the widespread conventional 
wisdom was that the more prosperous they became, the more they 
would behave like a democracy and be open to some of the ideas 
and notions of the West and certainly of freedom of expression 
and the like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Chairman Rubio">But they knew that history, too. They knew, they understood 
that as nations became more prosperous, their people demanded 
more political liberties, and so they have figured out a way to 
craft a system, given the sheer volume and size of their 
economy, to basically have a Communist Party at the center of 
their daily lives, a central, powerful government that--by the 
way, they link back to its thousands of years of history as 
part of their values and their success--but allowing free 
market activity, though not identical to ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Chairman Rubio">In essence, if you are a prosperous Chinese corporation, 
you may be independently owned, but when the government comes 
calling, you're going to do what they tell you, even if you 
don't want to do it, or you will be charged with corruption or 
you won't be in business for long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Chairman Rubio">In that context, they view the world, they view these 
things like notions of freedom of expression and speech not 
just as a threat. Their number-one priority, above everything 
else, is to maintain the Communist Party in charge. They view 
all these principles in the West and all these things that 
we're talking about as threats to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Chairman Rubio">But broader than that, they don't view it as their rules. 
They didn't write these rules, so why should they follow them? 
And they're trying to redraw all the global order along the 
principles that they argue for. And you start to see that 
exercise itself. They are beginning now to link their economic 
influence and power to their political gains and goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And we hear your story, Professor Hamilton, and we start 
thinking, boy, that's far-fetched, it sounds like a movie. We 
really aren't that far from that happening here in the United 
States if you start to think about it. Perhaps it's already 
happened, just not--and we certainly know that an individual 
working for the Marriott hotel was fired because he ``liked'' a 
tweet, which he says he did by mistake, by the way; but he was 
fired for that. We wish he could have testified here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Chairman Rubio">That said, a couple things I would point to. And the first 
is, just to be abundantly clear, you had an opportunity to 
publish a book and ran into impediments because publishers came 
to you and basically said I know we have a contract, but we're 
not going to go forward because, number one, they are going to 
get really rich billionaires acting as agents of the Chinese 
government to sue us and tie us up in courts here in Australia. 
And number two, we're worried about what it might imply to our 
access as a company, beyond your book, to that 1 billion-plus 
population market that they have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And you have seen that play out now in academia as well 
where you have university presses and even others here in the 
United States where you have speeches canceled because 
universities have a program over there and they feel that they 
are going to pull the plug on that and/or on the lucrative 
business of attracting Chinese students to travel and study 
here at exorbitant tuition rates. All those things are 
threatened, they feel those things are threatened, if they 
publish a book or they invite a speaker on campus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Chairman Rubio">    That is clearly what you have experienced and what we've 
seen replicated here. Is that an accurate description?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hamilton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Yes, indeed, Senator, it is. I would point
out that, as I said in my testimony, the disturbing thing about 
the spiking of ``Silent Invasion'' was not that Allen &amp;amp; Unwin 
felt that its market in China would be threatened, because it 
doesn't have a market in China, but that the CCP would 
interfere in Australian domestic politics through the use of 
the legal system to stop Australians hearing from another 
Australian about a concern, a threat to our democratic values. 
That was the most disturbing aspect of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">And as I have tried to stress in my statement to the 
Commission, universities are exceptionally important because 
intellectuals, academic scholars, they set the tone, they are 
the experts on whom we rely for information about China and the 
meaning of what's happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">And now that in Australian universities, as in universities 
around the world, but particularly in Australian universities--
because the number of Chinese students at Australian 
universities is proportionately five times higher than in the 
United States, and so the financial dependency is very heavy 
indeed. And money can buy silence. Money can buy compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">And one thing that has disturbed me tremendously in the 
writing of this book and even more so since publication is the 
way in which the defenders of fundamental democratic rights, 
particularly the right to free speech, can be bought off. I 
mean, of course, they don't see it that way. They have all 
sorts of excuses and arguments about, We have to balance the 
various interests of the university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">As I've said to those who have argued this to me, who've 
tried to persuade me not to criticize their university too 
heavily in my book, I said, well, no, it is not a question of 
trading off academic freedom against income from China. You 
know, academic freedom trumps other factors. You are not a 
commercial enterprise, and even if you were we would expect you 
to have an attachment to basic democratic values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">    And yet the commercialization of universities in Australia 
has been so strong and they have become so heavily dependent, 
not only on money from Chinese students but from a whole 
network of research and other relationships with Chinese 
universities, that the senior executives of those institutions 
are always worrying about what might happen on their campuses 
that could jeopardize that relationship. And I think this is 
deeply concerning for the future of the Western university if 
we are going to maintain that unique institution.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Rubio</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Well, again, I am certainly not an expert
on the Australian laws, but I do know we come from a common-law 
tradition, so there is probably something similar to what I am 
about to cite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And your case, as you outline it, is something that I hope 
we will examine in Federal law here in the United States 
because I think it falls within the context of something called 
intentional interference with a business agreement or 
intentional interference with a contractual relation. The 
elements of it--I have pulled them up here just to make sure--
here are the elements, and I think you fulfill every single one 
of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Chairman Rubio">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The existence of a contractual relationship or a 
beneficial business relationship between two parties--that 
could be a job with a company or, in your case, a contract with 
a publisher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Chairman Rubio">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Knowledge of that relationship by a third party--
obviously, the Chinese government and/or its agents where it 
had knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Chairman Rubio">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; Intent of the third party--in this case, the 
Chinese government and others--to induce a party to the 
relationship to breach the relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Chairman Rubio">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The lack of any privilege on the part of the third 
party to induce such a breach. In essence, there is no 
privilege for them to be able to do that. It's not like they 
are violating a contract with them, they are simply doing it 
because they want to silence your voice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Chairman Rubio">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt; The contractual relationship is breached and 
damage to the party against whom the breach occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Chairman Rubio">I mean, it seems to me as if--I don't know if there is a 
similar statute under Australian law--but it seems to me that 
the case you've described fits these criteria. And it would be 
interesting to examine--I confess I haven't done so before this 
hearing today--how such a scenario, if it played out in the 
United States, whether it's an employee that worked somewhere 
and is fired because of that interference or whether it's a 
book deal or a speech for compensation or the like--if in fact 
there is evidence and someone can go to court and prove that 
actions on behalf of a government and/or its agents caused a 
breach in that sort of contract, whether there shouldn't be a 
cause of action and damages. And if you cannot collect against 
the Chinese government, then collect against the party that you 
had the contract with and who violated it out of fear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And again, I think some of the things that get people's 
attention is when suddenly there is a civil cause of action for 
this. And this is going to require a lot more work and I have 
got to think about it, but we cannot allow this to continue as 
far as our laws here are concerned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Chairman Rubio">    And I for one intend to look at and see whether or not 
there are changes to be made in Federal law so that if what 
happened to you happens to someone here, whether it's a book 
deal or employment at Marriott, and then is fired by 
interference, that person now has a cause of action to pursue 
against the employer or the book contractor if they can't 
collect against the Chinese government, and maybe both.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hamilton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Well, it could be a very powerful counter-use
of the legal system to resist this kind of intimidation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">There have been cases in Australia where Australians of 
Taiwanese heritage have been fired from their jobs because when 
their bosses asked them if they supported Taiwanese 
independence they said yes--and they were fired. And this is 
clearly contrary to employment law in Australia. You can't fire 
someone for their political opinions. And yet, the situation is 
such that no one has taken it upon themselves to defend these 
people. So it's clearly contrary to employment law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">The difficulty in the case of my book is that one would 
need to be able to demonstrate in a court of law that a 
litigant against Allen &amp;amp; Unwin who might be mentioned in the 
book was acting on behalf of a foreign power for political 
reasons rather than out of a genuine concern for the damage to 
their reputation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">I suspect that if the new foreign interference law is 
passed in Parliament--and it should be, although, I mean, it is 
likely to be, albeit with some amendments--then we will find 
that the intelligence agencies in collaboration with the 
Australian Federal Police, the enforcement body that would be 
responsible for enforcing the laws, would be able to--sorry, 
the intelligence agency ASIO would be able to provide its 
secret intelligence information establishing those links 
between a litigant and the Chinese Communist Party, which would 
be a basis under the new foreign interference laws for a 
prosecution. And those acts of foreign interference, which are 
there defined, carry very heavy penalties indeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">    And so many of us are looking forward, not only to the 
passage of the legislation, but the first prosecutions under 
the new laws because we feel as though that will be a watershed 
in which the intelligence agencies and the law enforcement 
agencies come together to make an example of Beijing's proxies 
attempting to undermine the democratic rights of Australians, 
including the right to free speech by publishing a book like 
this.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Rubio</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Well, my final point before I turn it over
to the Cochair--and I thank you for being here. I really want 
what you've said here today to be heard by the State 
Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Two final points. One, it's amazing what people admit to 
and/or what you can find under subpoena or what they admit to 
when they're under oath and facing perjury. And so, again, 
that's why I think the legal system is created--for protecting 
people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Chairman Rubio">The other is something you mentioned, how one of the 
reactions now has been to cite this as xenophobic measures and 
the like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Chairman Rubio">It's interesting. I didn't get there, but I just did an 
interview a few minutes ago with a major news outlet talking 
about Confucius Institutes. And one of the questions in there 
was, isn't this just scaremongering? As if to imply this is 
anticommunist scaremongering, and perhaps you can see how that 
could be extended. It is one of the arguments that some of the 
schools that continue to fight us on Confucius Institutes are 
making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Chairman Rubio">It's an absurd one since this Commission every year 
publishes long lists of Chinese citizens who are detained, 
since much of the information that we get about what's 
happening are abuses against Chinese citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And then as far as scaremongering is concerned, I think if 
there has been a positive development on this front, it is that 
just in the last six to eight months there is a growing 
awareness across the whole of government about the scale and 
the scope of what we are up against here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And it has not yet--and we are going to get to Dr. Lantos 
Swett in a moment--but it has not yet potentially translated 
all the way there, but we are on our way there. And we are 
going to make it a part--and we are going to talk about that in 
a moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Chairman Rubio">But thank you for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Chairman Rubio">I want to go to the Cochair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Cochairman Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Chairman Rubio">I will just first direct my questions and then later on go 
to our other two distinguished witnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Let me just say, Professor Hamilton, thank you for your 
very clear testimony and your leadership. I mean, it is so 
absolutely needed. You are rare and it's so great to have your 
voice here at this Commission today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Chairman Rubio">You know, the shameful complicity and the cowardice of many 
in our academic community, some of the biggest and most 
prestigious universities, not just in this country, but around 
the world, is not new.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Chairman Rubio">I would remind my colleagues that back in 1979, a guy by 
the name of Steven Mosher, who was with Stanford, spent a full 
year, went to Guangdong, published a book called ``Broken 
Earth''--and I have read it because I was elected along with 
Frank Wolf, who is here today--in 1980, the same year Ronald 
Reagan got elected. And it had a profound impact in exposing 
the barbarity of the one-child-per-couple policy, forced 
abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And for anyone who does not think that the consequences 
have been lifelong, the Washington Post just did a piece a few 
days ago called ``Too Many Men'' and pointed out that there are 
the missing girls, that we have raised in this Commission over 
and over again. Last year, we documented some 62 million 
missing females exterminated through sex-selection abortion in 
part because of the child/boy preference coupled with a child 
limitation imposed by the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Chairman Rubio">But Mosher broke that story and Stanford, to its 
everlasting shame, threw him out of the university. The Wall 
Street Journal did a piece called ``Stanford Morality''--
immorality is what it really was--and they defended Steven 
Mosher and said, how could they?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Now, the Chinese government threatened Stanford and said 
if, in the future, people want to come here and do their work, 
they might find it a lot harder to have access. But where is, 
as you said, Professor, the academic freedom, the idea of 
robust inquiry so that you leave no stone unturned in telling 
the unfettered truth?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Stanford brought shame to itself and we're seeing the 
consequences of what they and so many others, including some in 
the human rights community, have done over the years in 
disregarding that issue, but also being willing, as the good 
chairman said, you know, the Confucius Centers. We have a GAO 
report that will be coming out soon. We have had a number of 
hearings on it, both in the Commission and in my Subcommittee 
on Human Rights. NYU and others who all have a presence in 
China get huge amounts of money from the government. If you 
think that doesn't stifle free speech and academic inquiry, 
I'll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And I know you would think that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Chairman Rubio">So maybe you can--my belief is that this is still getting 
worse. You know, that goes back to 1979 with Stanford. 1980, 
1981, 1982, we have seen this grow. And now it's even worse. 
All over Europe, Confucius Centers are all over Africa. I just 
had a hearing on that, myself and my Africa, Global Health, and 
Global Human Rights Committee. It's happening everywhere. They 
want to transform the world. And what they want as their vision 
is a totalitarian dictatorship where the people serve the 
government and not the other way around and they do so with 
huge amounts of repression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Chairman Rubio">    So if you could respond to that, how it's getting worse. It 
has not gotten better, it's only gotten worse.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hamilton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Well, thank you, Congressman. It is indeed
getting worse and it's getting worse because of the growing 
confidence of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese 
Communist Party rulers there and President Xi Jinping's 
determination to see the fulfillment of his China dream, the 
great rejuvenation of the Chinese people, which has a benign 
interpretation, but I think those of us who understand the more 
hawkish attitudes of the dominant factions within the Chinese 
Communist Party see that as effectively a blueprint for global 
domination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">I think now we can say with reasonable confidence that in 
their quiet moments the CCP leaders envisage that the PRC in 20 
or 30 years' time will be the dominant global power. And when 
that happens, we should all be afraid because they have no 
respect for basic democratic rights that we cherish so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">But as you have indicated, Congressman, and which I 
strongly endorse and have detailed in ``Silent Invasion,'' they 
can only get away with it if they have collaborators in Western 
countries like the United States and Australia, if they can buy 
off substantial segments of the elite who are willing to forgo 
essential democratic rights, such as free speech, in pursuit of 
other objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">And as I indicated, one of the things that has disturbed me 
most in the process of writing this book, and then watching 
subsequently after it has come out, is the truly tenuous 
commitment of some of my nation's leaders to the concept of 
free speech. It seems to be a tradeable commodity for those 
people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">And it's only when some of us are willing to take a risk. 
And, you know, in the case of, I think, all of us, it is often 
a personal risk to our own security and our own employment to 
say, no, we believe that free speech and other democratic 
rights come before all else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">And it has been--it was Senator Rubio who alluded to this--
very disturbing to see the way in which some Australian 
opinionmakers, including some of my own academic colleagues, 
have turned on me and people like me as being motivated by 
xenophobia. I actually have a very good record on antiracism 
over the decades in Australia. I come from the political left, 
which makes it more difficult for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">But I tell you what--this book was launched in Sydney by 
Chinese Australians, a group of Chinese Australians, the 
Australian Values Alliance, who came to my country to escape 
the clutches of Beijing. They went to Australia to enjoy the 
privileges and freedom of a democratic nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">But they live in fear because they know that the Chinese 
Communist Party has its agents all across Australian society 
who will punish them, which happened to Mr. John Hu, whom I 
mentioned, the Chinese Australian who helped launch this book, 
who, a week after he helped organize that launch event, arrived 
in Shanghai with his 80-year-old mother in order to scatter his 
father's ashes because he grew up in Shanghai. He was detained 
at the airport and put on the next plane back to Australia. And 
when he asked why, they said, You know why you are being 
detained; you're getting off lightly. If we allowed you into 
the country and then detained you, then you would really be in 
trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">This doesn't send a new message to Chinese Australians. 
This is a message they all understand. If they step out of 
line, if they criticize the Chinese Communist Party or act in a 
way which the party perceives as against its interests, they 
will be punished. And that is a tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">Cochairman Smith. I do know you have to go. But I'll just 
conclude with this comment. You know, the concern that we have 
is not just with universities, as you would expect, 
organizations. I mean, Chairman Rubio and I and this Commission 
fought very hard with the ABA when Teng Biao, his manuscript, 
which originally was going to be published by the American Bar 
Association, they reneged on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">We raised it repeatedly. We asked them to come and testify, 
to hold them to account. They did, however, allow Gao 
Zhisheng's manuscript to be published, so that's a good thing. 
But why does it take pressure with a group like the ABA that 
should be walking point and not backpedaling because of 
pressure?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">The other point is that the business community in this 
country has always been easy pickings. I'll never forget--and 
this has bipartisan complicity written all over it. Under Bush 
Sr., we had the problem where they thought that MFN was okay 
for the People's Republic of China. We had Tiananmen Square, of 
course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">And then Bill Clinton talked tough and said, Let's do an 
executive order, lays out markers. And then one year later--Mr. 
Wolf, who's here with us today, and I worked very hard on 
this--one year later, he completely reneged, he ripped up his 
executive order and gave MFN in May of 1994 with no human 
rights conditionality. And the Chinese looked at us and said, 
They care more about profits than they do about human rights. 
And that was a game-changer in the negative for the world, but 
especially for the Chinese people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">We have been trying ever since--ever since--to do our best 
to reclaim all of that lost ground, which subsequent 
presidents--Obama, Bush W.--did not, in my opinion, in any way 
faithfully promote the human rights of the people of China. 
This Commission will continue to try.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Hamilton">    I'm looking forward to reading your book. I haven't read it 
yet. But I thank you so much for your contribution and for your 
leadership.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hamilton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Hamilton"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Rubio</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Thank you. Thank you for being here. We
appreciate it very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Dr. Lantos Swett, I will start with you on this one. And I 
think your testimony is very compelling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Chairman Rubio">I, too, am concerned about the lack of more progress on 
breaking down internet firewalls. And I did want to share with 
you--we received late last night a letter from the CEO and 
director of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, Mr. Lansing, 
and here's what he cites--and I wanted to give you a chance to 
respond. Because I don't know if you have even seen the letter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Chairman Rubio">    Ms. Lantos Swett. I have not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Rubio</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Chairman Rubio">It says, ``In fiscal year 2017, Congress
appropriated $50.5 million to promote internet freedom 
globally.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And then ``BBG receives approximately a quarter of these 
funds, $15 million. The law makes clear that BBG funds should 
be available for tools and techniques to securely develop and 
distribute BBG digital content, facilitate audience access to 
such content on websites that are censored and coordinate the 
distribution of BBG digital content to targeted regional 
audiences and to promote and distribute such tools and 
techniques, including digital security techniques. To meet our 
statutory mandate, our annual appropriations act requires that 
BBG's primary goal in funding these technologies is to secure 
safe and secure access to BBG content.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And it goes on to say ``a significant secondary benefit is 
that once users reach a BBG platform, they then have means to 
access the internet writ large.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Chairman Rubio">So I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to that. 
The fundamental argument he is making is they only get $15 
million and it is primarily supposed to be to open up access to 
BBG content, not to the internet at large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Ms. Lantos Swett. Well, it's my understanding that that 
provision was added into only the most recent appropriations 
bill. That is new language that was inserted, it is my 
understanding, through the intense lobbying efforts of BBG. And 
while I have no objection to the BBG wanting to promote access 
to their content, I think that it is a very flimsy excuse for 
not funding technologies that enable vast numbers of people to 
access the internet freely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Chairman Rubio">I know of a number of other, sort of circumvention tool 
providers who would be quite happy to structure their 
technologies so that the first place they land is a BBG landing 
page. And then from there, they are able to go into the wide 
internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Chairman Rubio">But I think--and this is the bottom line--they are spending 
not $15 million on firewall circumvention technologies, they 
are spending a small fraction of that, it is my understanding, 
and this is where I hope that your Commission and that you as 
individual leaders in Congress can drill down and compel them 
to give you the answers. Because our internet freedom coalition 
gets, you know, frankly, blocked and diverted and stymied and 
sort of pushed off when we try to drill down and get the actual 
answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Chairman Rubio">But it is my understanding that of that $15 million, less 
than $3 million is actually being given in grants to vendors 
who are doing the work that Congress wants to see done. They 
are expending it in a variety of ways, as I indicated in my 
testimony, for small-scale research and development, small-
scale tools, VPNs, which are important, but do not have the 
ability to resist the large-scale attacks launched by China or 
other repressive regimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And at the end of the day, the numbers simply aren't there. 
And it is more than a little disingenuous for BBG to come back 
and say, Well, we are required by law only to promote our 
content, when that is a new provision in the law inserted there 
by the BBG. You know, it's sort of a different version of the 
person who throws themselves on the mercy of the court as an 
orphan when they are being charged with the murder of their 
parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Chairman Rubio">BBG sought that provision in the latest appropriations 
bill. It has not been there previously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Chairman Rubio">I don't have a huge objection to the notion of wanting to 
encourage people to access BBG content, but I am a little 
troubled by the idea that we use internet freedom dollars that 
Congress has appropriated to force them to read only the 
material produced by the BBG. It somehow doesn't sit right with 
this notion of free access. And I think, you know, I don't want 
to pick a fight with the BBG. I love much of what the BBG does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Chairman Rubio">As I mentioned, my father, you know, grew up first 
suffering under the depredations of the Nazis during the 
Holocaust, and then experienced what it was to live under 
communism. Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, Voice of 
America, Radio Marti, these are valuable services. I want the 
BBG to continue doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Chairman Rubio">But it is also a reality that increasingly people are 
seeking out information digitally on the internet. They are not 
restricted and nor should they be restricted to, sort of, the 
information that we are providing through those mechanisms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Chairman Rubio">So I would say--and again, you know, some of my language I 
know is tough, but I feel so passionate about this because 
we've been so frustrated and so stymied for so long and there 
is no good explanation as to why that should be the case. So be 
very careful when they show you numbers or when they come back 
with a seemingly very reasonable response. Compel them to 
provide the actual facts behind the matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Chairman Rubio">And I would really encourage you and your staffs--talk to 
the developers of these circumvention technologies. Find out 
from them, What is the problem? What are you being told? Why 
are you being cut off from funding?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Right now, BBG is funding one technology, to the best of my 
knowledge. It happens to be a commercial technology, not one 
developed by dissidents, not one being offered free of charge, 
but a commercial technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Chairman Rubio">There should be--you know, let a thousand flowers bloom, 
was that Mao's phrase? If we were doing what we should be 
doing, if we were offering on an annual basis not $15 million, 
but $30 million or $50 million, as Congress has indicated, as 
funding for this kind of technology, you wouldn't have a 
handful of five or six or seven developers, most of whom are on 
the verge of shutting down because they have no funding. These 
are dissidents who are providing this at no financial benefit 
to themselves in order to help their brethren and their sisters 
left behind in China. And they cannot stay alive as their 
funding is cut off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Chairman Rubio">    If we were doing 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 million dollars of 
grant funding for these kinds of groups, we wouldn't have five, 
four of which are struggling to stay alive. We'd have 25 or 30 
or more--and that's what we want.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Rubio</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Chairman Rubio">Well, just a couple of points. One, to the
broader issue of BBG and the like, we have to understand these 
entities were--the world has changed much since they were 
created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Chairman Rubio">The one I am most familiar with, of course, are the Martis, 
TV and Radio. And these were set up in a time when we had 
limited--three major networks and a handful of local, state, 
and national newspapers. Today, you literally are overwhelmed 
with news. I mean, there's just so much content.</paragraph>
