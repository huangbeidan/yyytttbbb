    <Doc-title>AN EXAMINATION OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION'S 7(A) LOANS TO POULTRY FARMERS</Doc-title>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="">Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="">The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 11:00 a.m., in Room 
2360, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Steve Chabot 
[chairman of the Committee] presiding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="">    Present: Representatives Chabot, Leutkemeyer, Velazquez, 
and Schneider.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">The Committee will come to order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">The Ranking Member is in another hearing. She will be here 
after a while, and my understanding is she just wants to submit 
her opening statement for the record. If she would want to give 
it we will, of course, give her that opportunity should she 
wish to do so. And we will probably be joined by additional 
members from both sides of the aisle here shortly, but we are 
going to go ahead and get started in the interest of everyone's 
time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">The mission of the Small Business Administration is to help 
small businesses compete and succeed in the marketplace. As we 
have heard many times from small businesses testifying before 
this Committee, access to capital is one of the biggest 
challenges small businesses face when starting or expanding 
their businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">To address the financing gap that small businesses can 
face, the SBA offers the 7(a) loan program for small businesses 
that have a plan in place for growth but lack the 
qualifications for conventional lending. SBA offers these small 
businesses government guaranteed loans through private lending 
partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Recent growth in the program has led to a closer look at 
the SBA's oversight tools. As a result of multiple hearings, 
meetings, and briefings, I, along with the Ranking Member, Ms. 
Velazquez, introduced H.R. 4743, the Small Business 7(a) 
Lending Oversight Reform Act of 2018. We could not come up with 
a shorter name. Our Senate counterparts have introduced similar 
legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">By strengthening the SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management 
and refocusing on the credit elsewhere test, this bicameral and 
bipartisan legislation aims to ensure the integrity of the 
program while bringing stability to small businesses that truly 
require the services of the SBA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">H.R. 4743 and the Senate version unanimously passed through 
both the House and Senate Small Business Committees in March of 
2018, and I hope they will soon be brought before the both the 
Full House and the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">The subject of today's hearing is further justification 
that more oversight of the SBA is needed to ensure that 
taxpayer dollars are preserved only for small businesses that 
cannot qualify for traditional lending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">A recent evaluation by the SBA's Office of Inspector 
General confirmed what the Committee had already suspected; 
that the SBA may have allowed nearly $2 billion of ineligible 
guaranteed 7(a) loans to non-small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">The OIG's findings are troubling as it appears that many 
small poultry farmers were unable to operate their businesses 
independently, thus violating the SBA's affiliation rules and 
other regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Today, members will have an opportunity to hear from the 
OIG about their findings and from the SBA about how the agency 
intends to implement the OIG's recommendations to ensure that 
future 7(a) loans meet the statutory, regulatory, and SBA 
requirements for eligibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">I appreciate very much the witnesses' testimony here 
shortly, and we look forward to your testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">And again, we will allow the Ranking Member's opening 
statement to be admitted for the record when she gets here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">And if Committee members have an opening statement 
prepared, I would ask that they be submitted for the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">And I will take just a moment to explain the lighting 
system which is very, I think, yeah, you have both testified. 
Five-minute rule. The green light will be on for 4 minutes. The 
yellow light will come on letting you know you have a minute to 
wrap up, and then the red light will come on to let you know 
that your time is up. And we would like you to stay within that 
if at all possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Since the Ranking Member got here so fast, it would be 
appropriate if she would like to, to go ahead and, whenever she 
is ready, to give her opening statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">    I will yield to the Ranking Member.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And thank
you all for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Chicken is America's favorite protein, topping beef and 
pork for the past 30 years. In 2016 alone, the USDA reported 
that American farmers raised over 8.8 billion chickens valued 
at $26 billion for domestic consumption and export. Public 
demand has resulted in significant changes to the poultry-
growing industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Where there were once 1.6 million independent farms across 
the country, a rapid shift to a vertical integration model has 
resulted in just 25,000 contract farms raising the vast 
majority of America's poultry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">The very nature of the industry is what brings us here 
today. Growers need capital to buy firms, build chicken coops, 
and buy feed to run their operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Over the past 4 years, the 7(a) program has experienced 
significant growth in poultry lending. As noted by the IG's 
report, SBA has guaranteed over 1,500 poultry loans totaling 
$1.8 billion from 2012 through 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">On the surface, this seems like we are helping small firms 
get access to capital. However, the nature of these growers' 
relationship with integrators suggests that loans may not be 
assisting what most of us consider small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">As we will hear from Mr. Ware, the level of control 
exercised over the growers is significant, from how to design 
and build their chicken coops to feeding and watering 
schedules, integrators have their hands in almost every aspect 
of a grower's business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Let's be clear about what is going on here. Large 
integrators own the chickens, sell the feed to the farmers, 
dictate the specifications of how to build the grow houses--all 
while pushing the costs and risk of financing and owning these 
very capital-intensive structures onto the farmers. Every 
report I have read, and discussions I have had with 
stakeholders, indicate there is little in the way of 
traditional lending to poultry growers. The industry relies 
almost exclusively on the government guaranteed lending from 
USDA and SBA used by growers to buy farms, construct chicken 
houses, and fund operations. This raises serious red flags.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">While we all support the SBA program for delivering credit 
to small businesses that cannot get it elsewhere, it is 
troubling if the program is being used to displace the growth 
of a traditional lending market and put taxpayers' money at 
risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">I look forward to hearing more from the IG about the 
details of their report and findings. I am also very interested 
in hearing from SBA on why they relied on a 1993 regional 
agency decision based on one contract to determine affiliation, 
or lack thereof, in these contracts for so long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Further, I am interested in how the regulatory changes from 
2016 are applied to poultry loan applications, and what SBA 
plans to do to address the affiliation concerns raised by the 
IG going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">    Thank you both for being here. Mr. Chairman, I yield back 
the balance of my time. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Thank you. Thank you very much. The
gentlelady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">And I would now like to introduce our distinguished panel 
here today. Since both have testified here before I am going to 
keep these relatively short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Our first witness will be Mr. Hannibal ``Mike'' Ware, who 
currently serves as the acting inspector general for the Small 
Business Administration. The President has nominated him to 
serve as the permanent inspector general, and both the Senate 
Small Business and the Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committees have favorably reported his nomination to 
the Full Senate. So congratulations, and hopefully everything 
will go smoothly for you there, and we look forward to hearing 
your testimony here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">And our second witness will be William Manger, who is the 
associate administrator for the Office of Capital Access at the 
SBA. One of the programs Mr. Manger's office administers and 
oversees is the 7(a) loan program. So we also appreciate your 
testimony and your response to questions here shortly.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF HANNIBAL ``MIKE'' WARE</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HANNIBAL ``MIKE'' WARE">    So we would now like to turn to Mr. Ware, who is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
STATEMENTS OF HANNIBAL ``MIKE'' WARE, ACTING INSPECTOR GENERAL, 
UNITED STATES SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION; WILLIAM M. MANGER 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. WARE">Thank you, Chairman Chabot, Ranking Member
Velazquez, and distinguished members of the Committee. Thank 
you for the opportunity to be here today and for your continued 
support of the Office of Inspector General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. WARE">We recently published the results of our evaluation of 
SBA's 7(a) loans made to poultry farmers. We independent 
initiated this review after speaking with the staff of this 
Committee, who raised the question about the controlling nature 
of contracts between large chicken companies, known as 
integrators, and poultry farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. WARE">We performed a preliminary assessment and took note of the 
increases to the size of this segment of the loan portfolio, to 
the size of these loans, and to the terms of these loans. We 
subsequently sought to gain an understanding of the operations 
of this industry and the practical application of SBA's 
regulations for loans to farmers within the industry. We 
reviewed Federal laws and regulations, SBA policies and 
procedures governing the 7(a) loan program, files of performing 
and defaulted loans, as well as grower-integrator contracts, 
agreements, and communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. WARE">We further reviewed U.S. Department of Agriculture's loan 
program guidance, industry-related economic and analytical 
publications, relevant publications from state university 
agricultural extensions and publications from industry trade 
associations. We also reviewed SBA internal communications, 
guidance, and selected SBA Office of Credit Risk Management 
lender reviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. WARE">We found that 7(a) loans made to growers did not meet 
regulatory and SBA requirements for eligibility. The 
integrators in our sample exercised such comprehensive control 
over the growers that we believe the concerns appear 
affiliative on their SBA regulations. Therefore, SBA and 
lenders approved 7(a) loans that were apparently ineligible 
under MBA-sized standard regulations and requirements. 
Specifically, in our review of 7(a) loans made to growers, as 
well as review of defaulted 7(a) loans to growers, we found 
integrator-control exercised through a series of contractual 
restrictions, management agreements, oversight inspections, and 
market controls. This control overcame practically all of the 
grower's ability to operate their business independent of 
integrator mandates. This control was enforced through close 
integrator oversight, management agreements, and grower-
integrator communication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. WARE">A grower's failure to comply with these requirements could 
result in a significant decrease in integrator payments, a 
reduction in flock placements, or a cancelation of the 
contract. A grower's economic viability was based upon a 
performing production contract with an integrator and is the 
true basis for grower income and facility value. As a result, 
from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016, SBA guaranteed 
approximately $1.8 billion in loans that may be ineligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. WARE">To improve SBA's oversight of the 7(a) loan program, we 
made two recommendations to the associate administrator for the 
Office of Capital Access. The first, to review the loans cited 
in the evaluation sample to determine whether SBA loan 
specialists and lenders made a proper size determination given 
the apparent affiliation based upon comprehensive contractual 
oversight and market control and take the appropriate 
corrective actions. And the second, to review the arrangements 
between integrators and growers under the revised regulations 
and establish and implement controls, such as supplemental 
guidance to ensure SBA loan specialists and lenders make 
appropriate affiliation determinations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. WARE">SBA management agreed to both of these recommendations. 
Both of these recommendations remain open in a resolve status, 
meaning OIG has agreed to management's plan of corrective 
action. I am proud of the work performed by our auditors. We 
certainly appreciate the broader implications of this review on 
the availability of 7(a) lending resources and on SBA's 
oversight of the various segments of the loan portfolio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. WARE">    Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, and I 
look forward to your questions.

</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF WILLIAM M. MANGER</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="WILLIAM M. MANGER">    Mr. Manger, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. MANGER">Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Chabot,
Ranking Member Velazquez, and members of the Committee. Thank 
you for the opportunity to speak with you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. MANGER">The recent inspector general report examined the agency's 
poultry loans and lending history. From their examination, two 
recommendations were issued, both of which SBA has agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. MANGER">One, SBA was asked to look at 11 loans that served as the 
sample size and basis of their review; and two, SBA was asked 
to consider further guidance to ensure that appropriate 
determinations of affiliation are being made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. MANGER">The loan activity highlighted by the inspector general 
occurred over a 5-year period beginning 7 years ago. Having 
joined the agency in March of 2017, I will need to rely on 
program office background and data, particularly during the 5-
year timeframe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. MANGER">Before discussing the IG recommendations, it might be 
helpful to share some data and provide an overview of our 
lending. Today, our overall 7(a) loan portfolio has a loan 
count of just over 265,000 loans, and an outstanding balance of 
$88 billion. Within that, poultry loans represent 1 percent of 
the entire 7(a) portfolio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. MANGER">The performance of poultry loans has been very good. These 
loans have a delinquency rate of .34 percent. This compares 
favorably to the 7(a) average of .7 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. MANGER">These loans are being made across 32 states and Puerto 
Rico. The top five states are Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas, 
Texas, and North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. MANGER">Examples of the types of loan being made include a $600,000 
loan to a Kentucky couple who were employed in farming but 
wanted to start their own business. Another was a $1 million 
loan in Mississippi to help save a local family-owned, but 
failing, poultry operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. MANGER">The IG report questioned whether the nature of the 
agreement between the poultry farmer and the business supplying 
the chicks is so controlling that SBA should consider the two 
businesses to be affiliated. This concept of affiliation is 
relevant in determining whether a business is small, because 
size is determined by aggregating the revenues or employees of 
the business with those of all of its affiliates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. MANGER">In the Small Business Act, Congress specifically included 
agricultural enterprises in the definition of small business. 
Agricultural enterprises are identified under the NAICS code 
system as including poultry and egg, forestry and logging, 
cattle ranching, and hog and pig farming, to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. MANGER">In our lending, SBA has adhered to longstanding policy 
guidance that the grower-integrator contract standing alone 
does not bring about affiliation. In addition, SBA, in 2016, 
removed from the affiliation regulations the provision that 
considers contractual relationships that may cause economic 
dependence of one business on another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. MANGER">The agency concluded that, in general, only firms that had 
common ownership or common management should be considered 
affiliated when determining eligibility for SBA financial 
assistance. As a result, SBA's current regulations do not 
consider whether the contract between an integrator and a 
poultry farmer results in economic dependence when determining 
the size of the poultry farmer that applies for financial 
assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. MANGER">Soon after joining the SBA, I began an examination of 
various loan policies and practices in my office. On issues 
like franchise agreements, we made changes that were well-
received by borrowers, lenders, and other interested parties. 
We also took action to update our standard operating procedures 
last fall with several aspects that improve program compliance 
and ensure prudent lending for all loans, including poultry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. MANGER">First, we changed some loan terms to a maximum of 15 years, 
tying that to the useful life of equipment. Second, we provided 
guidance that our financing is limited to farmland used only in 
the operation of a business. And third, for businesses with a 
change of ownership or with startups, we now require at least 
10 percent equity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. MANGER">As we continue to conduct our review of poultry lending, we 
want to hear from all our stakeholders, and we certainly 
welcome your views and want to hear from this Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. MANGER">    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look 
forward to working with all of you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Thank you very much. I appreciate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">And I will now lead off the questioning by recognizing 
myself for 5 minutes. And I will go to you first, Mr. Manger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">    What specific steps has the SBA taken since you were made 
aware of the inspector general findings? I know you discussed 
that to some degree, but if you could go over those.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> Certainly. So we did look at the 11 loans, as
requested by the IG's report. In fact, I have a report on the 
11 loans. And again, under our evaluation, using the 25-year 
longstanding policy of the agency, we determined that the 
contract in place did not create affiliation between the small 
rural farmer and the integrator, because the ability to profit 
and bear the risk of loss due to their own efforts was still 
apparent with the small rural farmer.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Mr. Ware, let me go to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">    Are you aware of any other industries, either agriculture 
or otherwise that extend such control over their growers? Are 
those growers eligible for SBA loans, and do you have any plans 
to examine any of those loans as well?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Our review in this case was specifically to the
poultry loans. So we did not look at others, although we came 
across, of course, the hog industry being one that is kind of 
close but it was not our intent to review that because of how 
closely they line up. So we think that the findings of this 
report could be used by the agency the same way.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Back to you, Mr. Manger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">    Since being made aware of the inspector general's findings, 
have you provided any guidance for any lenders? Do you intend 
to publish any kind of guidance or communicate with lenders or 
their trade associations going forward? Is there any 
communications effort that you think should be made there?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> After the report was released, we did make a
statement again that we were reviewing the 11 loans. Upon 
completion of that review we found that they had been done 
according to longstanding policy of the agency. We also 
informed the lenders that, for loans that were made under 
similar circumstances, in that case we would also honor the 
guarantee because obviously there was a lot of concern from the 
lenders that guarantees would not be honored. But we wanted to 
assure them again that the loans that we looked at, all 11 
loans were done properly, and so therefore, the guarantee would 
be honored.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Chairman CHABOT"> Mr. Ware, did your office examine whether
or not the credit elsewhere test was being applied properly to 
lenders? And should some of these growers have been able to 
qualify for conventional loans or USDA loans?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. WARE"> As part of this review, we did not look
specifically at the credit elsewhere test. We looked simply 
based on were they eligible for these types of loans. Eligible 
for the 7(a) loans.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Chairman CHABOT"> Do you think you should have gone and
looked at the credit elsewhere?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Well, the credit elsewhere test, we have a
separate review that is doing that, not only for poultry but 
across the board. So running in separate lanes but touching 
everything.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Chairman CHABOT"> Mr. Manger, are lenders properly applying
the credit elsewhere test before offering 7(a) loans for 
poultry farming or other related industries as far as you are 
aware? And why are these growers oftentimes unable to obtain 
credit elsewhere, particularly when they already have been 
offered a contract from a large poultry company with a long 
history in the industry?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. MANGER">No, I appreciate the question. And certainly,
Mr. Chairman, credit elsewhere is always something that the 
agency and my office is looking at because we want to ensure, 
as the Ranking Member said in her opening statement, we want to 
make sure that we are making loans available to those that need 
the capital, that are unable to access the capital 
conventionally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. MANGER">    Again, our office takes great pains in ensuring that loans 
are only being made to those that are unable to obtain credit 
elsewhere. In evaluating the loans, we have looked at them, and 
again, these people had in their files the proper certification 
that they were unable to--the lender makes the certification 
that these lenders would be unable to make the loan without the 
SBA guarantee. And so that is what we have seen, and again, 
these loans are to small rural farmers that many times there 
are not lots of other ways that they can access the capital 
except through our program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Chairman CHABOT"> Mr. Ware, did you want to comment on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. WARE">Yes. I thought I needed to expound quickly on
what I said before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. WARE">    So the basis of this review was their eligibility, and once 
we ran into the affiliation concerns that in our review were so 
clear based on the Code of Federal Regulations and what is 
detailed in there, the credit elsewhere did not become a 
primary function for us to look into for this particular 
review.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Thank you very much. My time is expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">    The Ranking Member is recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">    Mr. Manger, you stated in your testimony that the 
delinquency rates are very low on SBA poultry loans. I think 
you mentioned .3 percent compared to others, right? So if these 
loans are such a safe bet, why do they need to have an SBA 
guarantee? So if you are telling me that they are so good and 
they make so much sense, why is it that they cannot get a loan 
through traditional lending?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> So Ranking Member, many times these loans are
made for the acquisition of land, and in some cases actually 
the land is quite a large piece of property. And again, the 
individual does not have the collateral and some of the other 
prudent lending standards that a conventional loan would be 
made under in order to acquire not only the property but then 
to build the broiler houses on the property and all that goes 
into creating one of these farms. So in those situations, 
again, the lender makes the determination that they would not 
be willing to make that loan because of the risk inherent in 
making the loan unless they have the guarantee provided by the 
Small Business Administration.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">    Can you tell me, Mr. Manger, what reasons are typically 
cited by lenders to fulfill the credit elsewhere test to make 
these loans?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> So I would have to get back to you to see
exactly----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Well, this is an important issue.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> Absolutely.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Because it determines whether or not you are
following the law. If you cannot answer me, if you cannot 
answer this question, how could you tell me that those loans 
were----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> Ma'am, I can tell you that we take the credit
elsewhere standards extremely, extremely serious in my office.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> But you cannot answer--you cannot give me--
--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> I cannot give you some of the specific----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. MANGER">--examples----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. MANGER">--of what the reasons were.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">    Mr. Ware, the Pew Charitable Trust has also published 
reports that examine the poultry industry. They stated that 
government subsidies were a significant driver of the growth we 
have seen over the past years, 50 years. Did your investigators 
find many instances of nongovernment-backed lending in the 
poultry-growth industry?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. WARE"> We did not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Are either of you concerned the growth of
SBA involvement in poultry farms is pushing traditional lending 
out of this market?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. WARE"> If I was to answer that, that is probably a
viable concern but it was not the focus of our review.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">    So Mr. Manger?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> Ma'am, as I stated in my opening statement,
this is only 1 percent of the overall 7(a) portfolio 
representing 1.7 percent of the dollars.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> How much dollars?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> 1.7 percent of the overall portfolio is in
dollars. And that is not crowding out other businesses that 
need to access capital. The poultry industry is not crowding 
out----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> That is not my concern. My concern is if you
comply with the credit elsewhere test. That is my concern.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> And I can give you one reason probably why a
lot of these loans were made this way, because many of the 
loans were given a longer term than a conventional loan would 
offer, and that is one reason in credit elsewhere where we 
allow for an SBA loan to be made because the ability to repay 
the loan by the small farmer needs a longer term and it would 
not be available in a conventional loan. It is only available 
in an SBA loan. So that is one of the reasons in credit 
elsewhere why these loans would be eligible because in some 
instances the term of the loan was up to 21 years.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> So let me ask you this question.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Should there be similar requirements
aligning contract length with poultry loan length to protect 
the farmers and taxpayers?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. MANGER">As a matter of fact, I will just restate what
we did in the SOP that became effective on January 1st of this 
year. We have now limited the term of the loan to 15 years, 
tying that to the life of the useful equipment. In this case it 
would be the broiler houses. That was not the case before 
January 1st of this year. We also have now limited the amount 
of farmland that can be acquired only to the farmland that is 
necessary for the specific business. We found in some instances 
additional farmland was being acquired. We do not allow that 
except for what is necessary with the specific operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. MANGER">    And finally, and importantly, to talk about the risk, we 
are now requiring for a change of ownership or a start-up--many 
of these poultry businesses were start-ups--we are now 
requiring a 10 percent equity injection from the borrower. That 
is equity coming from the borrower, not from the taxpayer.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Chairman CHABOT"> The gentlelady's time has expired. Does
she need an additional minute? Or we can go to a second round 
if you like.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">All right. We will probably go to a second
round.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">    The gentleman from Missouri, the Vice Chairman of this 
Committee is recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">It would seem to me that the discussion today centers 
around the difference between a franchise and an affiliate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">    Mr. Ware, can you explain to me at the very essence here 
what your definition of affiliate is and why you believe that 
these farms do not comply?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. WARE">Sure. Thanks for the question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. WARE">    So the OIG does not have a problem necessarily with the 
relationship between a franchise or a franchisee as long as the 
contracts are not controlling by the franchiser.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Well, what is your definition of
controlling? I mean, because every franchise controls its 
franchisee to a certain extent. It depends on whether you are 
talking about an auto dealer, or you are talking about 
McDonald's, or are you talking about Cargill or Tyson? Those 
folks all have control over the people that are doing business.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Correct, sir. However, if the control is
comprehensive, by rule and by the law, it is so comprehensive 
that it----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Well, what is your definition of
comprehensive?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Comprehensive means--so it is not every franchise
that will qualify for a Small Business Administration loan. My 
definition----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Do you make loans to McDonald's? Do you
make loans to car dealerships?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. WARE"> I am not certain exactly who the SBA makes
loans----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Mr. Manger, do you make loans to car
dealers and McDonald's franchise folks?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> We have just started making loans available to
car dealerships.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> As we have reviewed----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Does anybody know the business model of a
car dealership? There is nobody that is controlled more than a 
car dealership by their company.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. WARE"> I would suggest that from our vantage point,
based on our review on poultry loans, right, that if that is 
controlling to the point where even the very specifications of 
your broiler house is controlled, when you can walk into your 
broiler house is controlled, where you can walk in your broiler 
house is controlled, when the chicks are fed, when they are 
given medicine is controlled, and if you do not adhere to 
anything you can lose your flock placement, you can lose your 
flock and that automatically will cause you to default, that is 
controlling.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Mr. Ware, you are talking to somebody who
has got millions of turkeys growing in his district.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> I know exactly what you are talking about.
And the reason that they do this, because those birds are not 
owned by the individual.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">Those birds are owned by the company that
puts them in there and they require certain things. Just like 
if you were building a building. If you are the contractor, the 
owner says I want this building built a certain way. I need 
these kinds of materials and I want it built a certain way. I 
am going to have the architect to make sure that it stays 
there. These buildings and these birds, there is a model, a 
business model that they want you to, just like any other 
franchise, with McDonald's, or whether it is a Ford dealership, 
there is a certain level of integration of all of the different 
requirements that the franchise wants you to, as a franchisee, 
to put into your business model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">The thing that concerns me here is you are forgetting about 
the rest of this business model. These people do not raise just 
turkeys and chickens. They also normally have a cattle 
operation affiliated with this because they normally have 
enough land to spread the manure out, which is a commodity that 
is an inexpensive way to fertilize your farm and they will have 
an integrated cattle operation as well. And that is usually 
financed separately from this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER">    So the answer to the Ranking Member's question a while ago, 
the reason that these farmers come to SBA for this is usually 
they are highly leveraged. They are trying to get a new 
building, buy a new farm next to them, and they cannot get this 
financing because of the amount of debt they are incurring 
because of the size of these buildings, which are several 
hundred feet long. So I am trying to figure out here how you 
can get to this affiliated definition whenever you have got so 
many other businesses out here that are franchise operations 
that are much more controlled by the franchise company than 
what these folks are because I know this model.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Can I answer?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Absolutely. I am looking forward to your
answer, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. WARE"> We do not have an issue with any of those things.
What we have issue with is that by definition, by the code, by 
the CFR, they are not considered small. So from our----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Okay. What is your definition of small
then?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Well, the CFR, in particular, concerning this
with affiliation again goes back to such comprehensive control 
that management agreements is the exact term that is used in 
there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> They do not control the entire operation
though, Mr. Ware. That is what I am trying to get at. They 
control only the poultry part of this operation. The operation 
may be several hundred acres with several hundred head of 
cattle on it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. WARE"> But that is now what the Small Business
Administration would be putting their guarantee for.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> They are guaranteeing the land and the
poultry buildings that are on there. The real estate and 
buildings. You are not guaranteeing the operation. The 
operation is completely different.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Well, Congressman, when these contracts, these
same contracts that they are guaranteed, when the flock 
placement is not right and the flock placement goes away, so 
does the loan. And here comes the guaranty.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Mr. Ware, if I have got a car dealership
and I am not meeting my quotas, do you know what happens? I 
lose my franchise. I have got to sell X number of units per 
month; otherwise, at the end of the month I am going to get a 
few more from the company who says now you have got another 30 
days to sell those on top of it or else.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. WARE"> But I am not sure your car dealership qualifies
as a small business.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> Mr. Manger said they are starting to do
that now.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. WARE"> And we would like to take a look at that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> I mean, I could go through a whole list of
franchise companies and we can talk about this all day, but my 
concern is that I think we are losing, we are nitpicking on 
this affiliate definition. I am not sure you really understand 
the business model of what a poultry farmer really is all 
about.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. WARE"> I do understand the business model pretty well. I
do understand it, and I am saying that that business model 
makes it affiliative by nature.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LUETKEMEYER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. LUETKEMEYER"> My time is expired.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">The gentleman's time is expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Since we have a relatively few number of members here 
today, we are going to go to a second round.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">I have just got one or two questions myself and then I am 
going to turn it over to the other members that are here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">My question is this. I note that the terms for poultry 
loans over the last few years have been getting longer, going 
up to 20 years; whereas, the contracts oftentimes are 
relatively short. In fact, your flock, my understanding is 5 to 
9 weeks or so. And I think if one of these small farmers, you 
know, goes out of business or whatsoever, if the contract is 
not renewed, it can be a pretty tough business to sell and you 
may get 6 percent on what you invested, the other 94 percent 
going away. So it is pretty challenging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">So would both of you comment on the lengthening of these 
loans and the short period of the contract? And would the small 
business farmer in this case not be better protected if the 
contracts, if that is something you took into consideration, 
that they were longer, so they had more of an assurance that 
they could remain in business for a longer time to support 
their time?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">    Mr. Manger?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. MANGER">Sure, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. MANGER">So the regulations stipulate that the lender must evaluate 
the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In some of the 
instances, specifically on the 11 loans that were analyzed, 
there was also the purchase of land involved. It was not solely 
for the construction of broiler houses. For the purchase of 
land, many times it would be necessary to a small rural farmer 
to be able to extend those payments out for a longer period of 
time in order to be able to acquire the property. So it is not 
solely based on contracts that the individual may have or the 
business may have. It is based on, again, their ability to 
repay the loan. And in this instance, in the loans I am citing 
with the acquisition of property, that is really the main 
reason why such a long term was needed on the loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. MANGER">    It also does not control what other businesses the small 
business may enter into. As was said earlier by Congressman 
Luetkemeyer, many times they would have a portion of the 
property maybe be for poultry, but they could be involved in 
other enterprises on other parts of the property, whether it be 
manure harvesting or other ventures. So again, it is not so 
reliant only on this one contract, especially in the 
acquisition of property and the lender must again certify that 
the borrower has the ability to repay the loan.

    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">    Mr. Ware, did you want to comment on that at all?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WARE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. WARE"> Sure. Yes. I need to comment on it because when
the agency is giving loans to poultry farmers, it is for that 
purpose. In the defaulted loans that we reviewed, when the 
contracts went away, so did the poultry farm. So I think that 
is a very vital piece of whatever review would be made, and I 
believe that in the industry, from what I have studied, in the 
industry they are moving toward their contracts in terms of the 
integrator and the farmers as being a little bit longer because 
of more conventional lending methods that are out there and 
that is the only way that they would qualify for those.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Thank you very much. I am going to yield
back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">    The Ranking Member is recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Mr. Manger, I heard you talk about some of
the changes about excess land equity injection, those issues 
have nothing to do with the affiliation issue. I know that you 
were not there in July 2016 when the IG presented its report, 
but I would just like to ask you, who signed off on the changes 
that were made, particularly knocking out the economic 
dependence of business contract affiliation? Who did that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> That was done by the previous administration. I
am not sure if it was signed off by the person that had the 
associate administrator position in Capital Access or----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Can you get back to us?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. MANGER"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MANGER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. MANGER">--or possibly the administrator at the time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Well, if those changes were made, I would
like to know who signed off on accepting those changes because 
this is a very important issue, the issue of affiliation, and 
if I have to introduce legislation to go to the original 
affiliation issue, I am going to do that. Okay?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman CHABOT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">The gentlelady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">We have one other member who we thought was on his way but 
in light of the fact that he is not here I think we are going 
to wrap up this hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">We appreciate the gentlemen giving their testimony here 
this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">An important industry, there are obviously some questions 
here we would ask our Committee staff to continue to work with 
the SBA to make sure that all the appropriate regulations and 
the loans that are being made are being made in a proper manner 
and that the dollars that we have available are going to 
actually help small businesses and the families that they 
support. So we will continue to follow this topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">I would ask unanimous consent that members have 5 
legislative days to submit statements and submit supporting 
materials for the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Without objection, so ordered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">If there is no further business to come before the 
Committee, we are adjourned. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">[Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Chairman Chabot, Ranking Member Velazquez, and 
distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to be here today and for your continued support of 
the Office of Inspector General (OIG). We recently published 
the results of our audit of the Small Business Administration's 
(SBA's) evaluation of 7(a) loans made to poultry farmers. I am 
happy to discuss our findings with you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">OIG's ROLE</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">OIG was established within SBA by statute to promote 
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness and to deter and detect 
waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in the Agency's programs 
and operations. During fiscal year (FY) 2017, OIG achieved over 
$82 million in monetary recoveries and savings and made 72 
recommendations for improving SBA's operations and reducing 
fraud and unnecessary losses in the Agency's programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">OIG audits are conducted in accordance with Federal audit 
standards established by the Comptroller General, and other 
reviews generally are conducted in accordance with standard 
established by the Council of the Inspector General on 
Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE). In addition, we coordinate 
with the Government Accountability Office to avoid duplicating 
Federal audits. We also establish criteria to ensure that the 
non-Federal auditors that OIG uses (typically, certified public 
accountant firms) comply with Federal audit standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">OIG's EVALUATION OF 7(A) LOANS MADE TO POULTRY FARMERS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">OIG report 18-13, titled Evaluation of SBA 7(a) Loans Made 
to Poultry Farmers presents the results of our review of loans 
made to poultry farmers under SBA's 7(a) Loan Program. The 7(a) 
Loan Program is SBA's primary program for helping startup and 
existing small businesses, offering financing guarantees for 
loan amounts up to $5 million to fund startup costs, expand 
existing businesses, purchase equipment, repair existing 
capital, and other uses. Participating lenders enter into an 
agreement with SBA to make loans to small businesses in 
accordance with SBA rules and regulations. Some 7(a) loans are 
made by lenders using delegated authority, which undergo 
limited review by SBA prior to loan disbursement. Other 7(a) 
loans are subject to more extensive underwriting and 
eligibility review and approval by SBA before the loan is 
disbursed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Our evaluation objective was to determine whether 7(a) 
loans made to poultry farmers (growers) met statutory, 
regulatory, and SBA requirements for eligibility. To accomplish 
our objective we reviewed Federal laws and regulations, SBA 
policies and procedures governing the 7(a) Loan Program, files 
of performing and defaulted loans, as well as grower-integrator 
contracts, agreements, and communications. We further reviewed 
U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) loan program guidance, 
industry-related economic and analytic publications, relevant 
publications from state university agricultural extensions, and 
publications from industry trade associations. We also reviewed 
SBA internal communications, guidance, and selected SBA Office 
of Credit Risk Management lender reviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">We interviewed officials and staff from the SBA Office of 
Capital Access, SBA Office of General Counsel, USDA Economic 
Research Service, USDA National Agricultural Statistics 
Service, USDA Farm Service Agency, USDA Office of Rural 
Development, and the USDA Office of Inspector General. We also 
interviewed executives and loan officers at various lending 
institutions, certified assessors, integrators, and growers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">We analyzed the population of 7(a) loans made to 
agricultural enterprises, and to the agricultural subset of 
poultry farmers, to obtain an understanding of the SBA loan 
portfolio, and its characteristics, for FYs 2012 through 2016. 
This population was limited to approved regular 7(a), Certified 
Lender Program, and Preferred Lender Program loans. Further, 
for this analysis, we defined agricultural enterprises to 
include North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) 
codes 111110 through 114210. The subset of poultry farmers was 
defined with NAICS codes 112320 and 112390. From this 
population, we judgmentally selected a sample of 11 loans; this 
sample was populated by loans at either the median size or the 
largest size for its fiscal year. We used this sample to guide 
a review of loan files, grower contracts, and grower-integrator 
communications, and interview parties to these loans, Further, 
we reviewed a sample of defaulted poultry loans to understand 
the degree to which integrator contracts affect facility value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">We conducted this evaluation in accordance with the Council 
of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency's quality 
standards for inspection and evaluation. These standards 
require that we adequately plan inspections; present all 
factual data accurately, fairly, and objectively; and present 
findings, conclusions, and recommendations in a persuasive 
manner. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a 
reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our 
evaluation objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">What OIG Found</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">We found that 7(a) loans made to growers did not meet 
regulatory and SBA requirements for eligibility. SBA 
requirements state that the small business applicant must be 
small under SBA size standards. The applicant combined with its 
affiliates must not exceed the size standard designated for 
either the primary industry of the applicant or the primary 
industry of the applicant and its affiliates, whichever is 
higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">The large chicken companies (integrators) in our sample 
exercised such comprehensive control over the growers that the 
SBA Office of Inspector General believes the concerns appear 
affiliative under SBA regulations. Therefore, SBA and lenders 
approved 7(a) loans that were apparently ineligible under SBA 
size standard regulations and requirements. Specifically, in 
our review of a sample of 11 7(a) loans made to growers, as 
well as review of defaulted 7(a) loans to growers, we found 
integrator control exercised through a series of contractual 
restrictions, management agreements, oversight inspections, and 
market controls. This control overcame practically all of a 
grower's ability to operate their business independent of 
integrator mandates. A grower's failure to comply with these 
requirements could result in a significant decease in 
integrator payments, a reduction in flock placements, or a 
cancellation of the contract. A grower's economic viability was 
based upon a performing production contract with an integrator 
and is the true basis for grower income and facility value. As 
a result, from FY 2012 to FY 2016, SBA guaranteed approximately 
$1.8 billion in loans that may be ineligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">OIG Recommendations</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">To improve SBA's oversight of the 7(a) Loan Program, we 
recommended the Associate Administrator for the Office of 
Capital Access (1) review the loans cited in the evaluation 
sample to determine whether SBA loan specialists and lenders 
made a proper size determination given the apparent affiliation 
based upon comprehensive contractual, oversight, and market 
control, and take the appropriate corrective action(s), and (2) 
review the arrangements between integrators and growers under 
the revised regulations, and establish and implement controls, 
such as supplemental guidance, to ensure SBA loan specialists 
and lenders make appropriate affiliation determinations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Agency Response</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">SBA management agreed with both recommendations made by 
OIG. Regarding Recommendation 1, SBA will perform a review of 
the loans cited in the evaluation to determine whether SBA loan 
specialists and lenders made proper size determinations. For 
Recommendation 2, SBA will review the arrangements between 
integrators and growers in light of the current affiliation 
rules and regulations. If needed, SBA will establish additional 
controls to ensure SBA loan specialists and lenders make the 
appropriate affiliation determinations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">I am proud of the work performed by our auditors to raise 
awareness of this growing segment of SBA's 7(a) loan portfolio. 
In performing this work, they obtained a deep understanding of 
the operations of this industry and the practical application 
of SBA's regulations for loans to farmers within the industry. 
We found that 7(a) loans made to growers did not meet 
regulatory and SBA requirements for eligibility. Integrators 
were ineligible to participate in the SBA 7(a) Loan Program due 
to their size; however, integrators exercised such 
comprehensive control over the growers that the SBA OIG 
believes the concerns were affiliated. Therefore, SBA and 
lenders approved 7(a) loans to growers that appear ineligible 
under SBA size standard regulations and requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">OIG will continue to provide independent, objective 
oversight to improve the integrity, accountability, and 
performance of the SBA and its programs for the benefit of the 
American people. Our focus is to keep SBA leadership, our 
congressional stakeholders, and the public currently and fully 
informed about the problems and deficiencies in the programs as 
identified through our work. We value our relationship with the 
Committee and the Congress at large, and we look forward to 
working together to address identified risks and the most 
pressing management challenges facing SBA.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Hearing: ``An Examination of the Small Business 
Administration's 7(a) Loans to Poultry Farmers''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Wednesday, April 18, 2018</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Statement for the record by Hon. James Comer, Kentucky</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Barriers to entry in agriculture are very high, especially 
for small businesses. While large companies can use capital 
markets to raise financing, small businesses typically use 
traditional banking and often have trouble obtaining financing 
through the traditional lending market. Many do not have the 
credit history or large collateral necessary to obtain private 
financing and overcome these barriers. Small businesses are 
then either unable expand their farm, must obtain their 
financing through the Small Business Administration's public-
private partnerships with private lenders, or are shut out from 
agriculture entirely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">The 7(a) loan program fills a lending gap in the market for 
poultry growers by offering guarantees of repayments made to 
the lenders. By doing so, banks are provided the ability to 
extend credit to otherwise unproven entrepreneurs, farmers are 
provided a cash flow and access to capital they otherwise 
couldn't find, and the government makes its money back on an 
investment in American agriculture at no cost to the American 
taxpayer. The 7(a) program minimizes uncertainty to small, 
independent family farms and incentivizes young Americans who 
want to start their own business in agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Chairman CHABOT">Particularly when the farm economy is experiencing a 
downturn, as it is now, we should be doing all we can to 
provide certainty and stability to America's farmers, and 
administering necessary loan guarantees to poultry growers to 
maintain this stability.</paragraph>
