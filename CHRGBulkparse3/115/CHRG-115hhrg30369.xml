    <Statement>
    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HONORABLE MIKE BOST, CHAIRMAN</opening>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bost">Good morning, and welcome everyone. This joint
hearing of the Subcommittees on Disability Assistance and 
Memorial Affairs and Oversight and Investigations will now come 
to order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bost">I first want to thank my colleagues, Chairman Bergman, 
Ranking Member Esty, who should be along shortly, and Ranking 
Member Kuster for holding the hearing here with me today on the 
important issue that we are facing. And that is helping Gulf 
War veterans get the benefits that they have earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bost">It should go without saying that we have a duty to take 
care of the men and women who have been wounded while serving 
in our military. Unfortunately, too many injured Gulf War 
veterans are not being taken care of. VA estimates that 44 
percent of Gulf War veterans develop Gulf War Illness. Yet, 26 
percent of these veterans are receiving benefits. Something 
does not add up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bost">On March 15, 2016 during a similar joint hearing on GWI 
claims, VA testified that it was taking steps to improve 
service for Gulf War veterans. Yet one year later GAO found VA 
is still only approving 17 percent of the claims of Gulf War 
Illness, which is about a third of the approved rate for other 
claims. For example, a GAO report says that only 13 percent of 
the claims of veterans that were diagnosed with the illness are 
approved. I cannot understand that at all. VA regulations state 
that if veterans have certain symptoms, such as headache, 
fatigue, or joint pain, VA is supposed to presume that these 
symptoms are related to the veteran's service in the Gulf area. 
Yet 87 percent of these claims are denied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bost">GAO found that one of the problems is that the VA 
physicians are applying the wrong standards during the exams. 
Another issue is that the VA employees are not ordering the 
exams when necessary. I appreciate that recently the VA 
retrained all of its employees on GWI claims and I am looking 
forward to hearing whether retraining these employees made a 
difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bost">I am also frustrated because GAO pointed out that the VA's 
decision letters are not clear. This issue keeps coming up. As 
you know, my Appeals Reform Bill, H.R. 2288, would require VA 
to make its decision letters more clear and useful for the 
veterans. But it should not take legislation to force the VA to 
act. I would like to see the VA change its decision letters now 
so that the veterans understand why VA made the decisions it 
did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bost">So GAO also found several other problems that may be 
keeping the approval rate for GWI claims low, such as the lack 
of a single case definition for GWI. I am looking forward to an 
honest discussion about the VA's need to do so and how to 
ensure that they do. None of us want to come back here next 
year to find the same problems. After this hearing I intend to 
work with my colleagues to keep on VA to make sure these 
changes are made and made this time where we will not have to 
do it again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bost">I ask unanimous consent that written statements provided 
for the record be placed into the hearing record. Without 
objection, so ordered.</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF ANN KUSTER, RANKING MEMBER</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ANN KUSTER">    I also want to thank the witnesses for being here today. 
With that, I want to call on the Oversight and Investigations 
distinguished Ranking Member Ms. Kuster for her opening 
statement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kuster</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Kuster">Thank you, Chairman Bost. And to General
Bergman, and Ms. Esty when she arrives, and to the witnesses 
for being here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Kuster">It has been 26 years since the beginning of the Persian 
Gulf War and since that time 44 percent of veterans who served 
in that conflict have suffered from Gulf War Illness. Sadly, 
these veterans struggle to receive accurate diagnoses for their 
symptoms, access to needed health care, and compensation for 
their service-connected conditions, even with the presumptions 
that should result in more veterans receiving benefits and not 
denied claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Kuster">Last year our Subcommittee held a hearing, as the Chairman 
said, on access to treatment for Gulf War Illness and how more 
research is needed to develop treatments and get our veterans 
the health care they need. Now we are back here again. And by 
the way, this is entirely bipartisan across our Committee, to 
determine why 83 percent of Gulf War Illness claims are denied 
by the VA and what we can do to ensure that our Gulf War 
veterans receive the benefits that they have earned. Gulf War 
Illness is a chronic, painful, often debilitating disease and 
veterans suffering from Gulf War Illness deserve disability 
compensation and to have their condition recognized and treated 
by VA providers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Kuster">Now just this past Monday, the State Veterans Advisory 
Committee in my home state of New Hampshire, whom I meet with 
on a quarterly basis, were criticizing the VA's process for 
adjudicating Gulf War Illness claims. In fact one of the 
members of our State Advisory Committee had his own claim for 
Gulf War Illness denied. And for the veterans in my state and 
across the country, the VA's process is poorly run and fails to 
adequately train personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Kuster">This latest GAO report confirms what our constituents 
suffering from Gulf War Illness continue to tell us on a 
regular basis. Their claims continue to be denied because 
medical examiners do not know how to diagnose Gulf War Illness 
or the VA fails to apply the presumption that Congress intends 
to grant this service-connection disability. When these claims 
are denied, VA does not communicate to veterans, as the 
Chairman said, the reasons for the denial, leading to veterans 
becoming frustrated, losing faith in the VA, and filing 
appeals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Kuster">The GAO report found that 90 percent of medical examiners 
that the VA relies upon to assess veterans' disabilities have 
not completed the elective training on Gulf War Illness so they 
can better assess veterans' disability levels. I would like to 
know why this training is not a mandatory requirement and when 
it will become mandatory. I would also like to know if this web 
based training is sufficient to train medical examiners and if 
claims processors need better training requirements as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Kuster">I also wish to hear from the VA on its plan to improve the 
way in which it communicates decisions made on claims. When 
veterans are not provided the reason that the claim was denied, 
they become frustrated and angry and they end up in our appeals 
process, which is already swamped. If they do not know why the 
claims were denied, they can often spend years attempting to 
obtain their benefits through a lengthy appeals process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Kuster">Finally we know that the VA continues to conduct and 
support research on Gulf War Illness. However, the VA lacks a 
single case definition, and as I understand it has no plan to 
develop one. A uniform case definition for Gulf War Illness was 
recommended in 2014 by the VA's Research Advisory Committee and 
the National Academy of Medicine. A single case definition is 
needed to improve research, diagnosis, and treatment of Gulf 
War Illness and I would like to see a plan put in place to 
develop a single Gulf War Illness definition. The number of 
Gulf War Illness claims doubled from 2010 to 2015 and we can 
expect that more veterans will file claims and will 
subsequently appeal denied claims. It is imperative that the VA 
implement the GAO's recommendations now so that Gulf War 
veterans receive the treatment and disability benefits that 
they deserve without having to fight the VA every step of the 
way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Kuster">    Thank you, Chairman Bost. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bost">Thank you, Ms. Kuster. And I am going to ask that
all Members waive their opening remarks, as per the Committee's 
custom. I understand that Chairman Bergman and Ranking Member 
Esty will give their statements at the end of the hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bost">Now I would like to welcome our witnesses again and thank 
you for taking the time to be here today. Our first witness is 
Bradley Flohr, Senior Advisor for Compensation Services. He is 
accompanied this morning by Dr. Patrick Joyce, the Chief, 
Occupational Health Clinics of the Washington VA Medical 
Center. We are also joined by Melissa Emrey-Arras--is that 
correct? Well, now see with a name like Bost, where people say 
Bost, I want to make sure that we get everybody's right. Who is 
Director of the Education, Workforce and Income of the GAO. 
Zachary Hearn, the Deputy Director for Claims for the Veterans 
Affairs and Rehabilitation Division of the American Legion; and 
Michael Figlioli, correct? The Department Director of National 
Veterans Services of the VFW; and finally Anthony Hardie, the 
National Board Chair and Director of Veterans for Common Sense.</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF BRADLEY FLOHR</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="BRADLEY FLOHR">    I want to remind the witnesses that your complete written 
statement will be entered into the hearing record. And with 
that, Mr. Flohr, you are recognized for five minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Flohr">Thank you, Chairman Bost, Chairman Bergman,
Ranking Members Esty and Kuster, and Members of the Committee. 
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss how VA processes Gulf 
War veterans' compensation claims for undiagnosed illnesses or 
medical unexplained chronic multi-symptom illnesses. For 
purposes of my testimony, I will refer to these categories of 
illness as Gulf War Illness. Today I will provide an overview 
of VA's processing of Gulf War Illness claims and some of our 
training and quality assurance efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Flohr">Service connection may be awarded for Gulf War Illness when 
a veteran has service in the Southwest Asia Theater of 
operations after August 2, 1990 and has a qualifying disability 
in accordance with 38 C.F.R. 3.317. VA recently revised this 
regulation to extend the date for which service-connection may 
be awarded for Gulf War Illness from December 31, 2016 from 
December 31, 2021.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Flohr">In fiscal year 2016, 18,681 veterans received a decision 
for a claim specifically for Gulf War Illness. From this 
number, 4,594 veterans were awarded service-connection for one 
or more undiagnosed illness or chronic multi-symptom illness. 
Thirteen percent of these awards were for an undiagnosed 
illness and 31 percent for a medical unexplained multi-symptom 
illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Flohr">VBA continues to strengthen its training program for Gulf 
War Illness claims. We have developed 13 related courses for 
claims processors and over the last year VBA headquarters 
mandated ten hours of training for rating veteran's service 
representatives. In addition, we are currently developing a new 
training module which will focus on the proper development of 
Southwest Asia Gulf War claims. This module is scheduled to 
launch to fiscal year 2018.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Flohr">VA has implemented a number of other initiatives to improve 
Gulf War claims processing, to include improvement of the 
notification process, specifically to include a more thorough 
explanation when a claimed issue is denied. In recent years VA 
has developed special tracking to specifically account for Gulf 
War claims. VA has also amended its Gulf War general medical 
examination template to include important information for 
examiners when address undiagnosed and chronic multi-symptom 
illnesses, as well as information on various environmental 
exposures in the Gulf War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Flohr">VA is constantly looking for ways to improve benefits and 
services it provides to veterans who served in the Gulf. VBA 
works closely with the Veterans Health Administration in 
reviewing the research done by its Offices of Public Health and 
Research and Development, as well as the National Academy of 
Medicine's biennial updates on Gulf War issues. VBA also works 
with VHA and the Department of Defense in joint work groups 
that research environmental exposures coincident with military 
service. VBA collaborates with VHA to update training for its 
medical examiners, as well as VBA's contract medical examiners. 
And finally, VBA's national quality review staffs, as well as 
local quality reviewers in our regional offices, continue to 
ensure employees correctly process and decide claims for Gulf 
War Illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Flohr">As agreed upon with the National Gulf War Resource Center, 
VBA conducted two distinct special focus reviews of decisions 
on claims for Gulf War related illnesses in December, 2015 and 
September, 2016. The review in 2015 focused on fiscal year 2015 
Gulf War Illness cases and showed a 94 percent accuracy rate. 
The 2016 review expanded the review to cases that involve 
claims from medical unexplained chronic multi-symptom illnesses 
over a four-year period, starting from fiscal year 2011. This 
review showed an 89 percent accuracy rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Flohr">VA continues to improve the efficient, timely, and accurate 
processing of claims involving service in the Gulf War. 
Although the science and medical aspects of undiagnosed 
illnesses and chronic multi-symptom illnesses are complex, VA 
continues to review scientific and medical literature to gain a 
better understanding of the impact of these illnesses on our 
Gulf War veterans.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS">Thank you, Mr. Flohr. Ms. Emrey-Arras, you are
recognized for five minutes to give testimony for the GAO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS">Ms. Emrey-Arras. Thank you, Chairman Bost, Chairman 
Bergman, Ranking Member Kuster, and Members of the 
Subcommittees. I am pleased to be here today to discuss our 
recent report on VA's evaluation of Gulf War Illness disability 
claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS">The exact causes of Gulf War Illness are not always known 
and veterans' symptoms vary widely. Veterans with Gulf War 
Illness may experience symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, 
joint pain, indigestion, insomnia, respiratory disorders, skin 
problems, and memory impairment. They may also have infectious 
diseases, like malaria or West Nile Virus. VA refers to claims 
for Gulf War Illness as undiagnosed illness, medically 
unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness, and infectious 
disease claims. We refer to these three types of claims as Gulf 
War Illness claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS">My testimony today will focus on our findings related to 
three key areas. One, recent trends in Gulf War Illness 
disability claims. Two, challenges VA faces. And three, VA's 
Gulf War Illness research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS">In terms of claims trends, we found that the number of Gulf 
War Illness claims processed has increased in recent years. In 
fiscal year 2015, VBA completed processing about 11,400 claims, 
which was more than double the 4,800 claims it processed in 
fiscal year 2010. Many of these claims included multiple 
medical issues or symptoms related to Gulf War Illness. On 
average, we found that Gulf War Illness claims took four months 
longer to process than other claims. We also found that Gulf 
War Illness claims were approved at lower rates than other 
types of disability claims. We found that approval rates for 
Gulf War Illness medical issues were about three times lower 
than for all other claimed disabilities. Specifically we found 
that 17 percent of Gulf War Illness medical issues were 
approved compared to 57 percent for all other types of medical 
issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS">According to VA, several factors may contribute to the 
lower approval rates, including that these claims are not 
always understood by VA staff. Additionally, veterans sometimes 
file for Gulf War Illness benefits but according to some VA 
staff we spoke with do not provide sufficient evidence that 
their symptoms have existed for at least six months as 
generally required by VA regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS">In terms of challenges VA faces, we found that there is 
inadequate training for VHA medical examiners. VBA claims 
rating staff often rely on these medical examiners to assess a 
veteran's disability before they make a decision on a claim. 
Medical examiners we interviewed said that conducting Gulf War 
medical exams is challenging because of the range of symptoms 
that could qualify as Gulf War Illness. The VHA has offered an 
optional 90-minute web based Gulf War Illness training for its 
medical examiners since 2015, but according to VHA, training 
data only showed ten percent of the examiners had taken this 
training as of this past February. We recommended that VA 
require its medical examiners to complete training on Gulf War 
Illness and VA agreed with this recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS">We also found that decision letters VA sends to veterans 
denying benefits for Gulf War Illness claims do not always 
clearly explain to the veteran how their claim was decided, 
which can leave a veteran uncertain about how the claim was 
evaluated and potentially lead to unnecessary appeals. We 
recommended that VA require decision letters to clearly explain 
how the claim was evaluated and VA agreed with our 
recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS">In terms of Gulf War Illness research, we found that VA 
does not have a plan to develop a single case definition of 
Gulf War Illness. VA advisory groups have emphasized that 
establishing a single definition could further improve the 
research, diagnosis, and treatment of veterans. VA's advisory 
groups recommended that in the near term VA analyze data from 
its existing datasets and in the long term conduct research 
projects to contribute to the establishment of the single case 
definition. VA included in its 2015 Gulf War Research Strategic 
Plan an objective to establish a single definition, but the 
agency has no action plan in place to achieve it. Without a 
plan VA risks engaging in research that is not targeted towards 
its goal. We recommended that VA prepare a plan to develop a 
single definition and VA agreed with this recommendation.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF ZACHARY HEARN</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ZACHARY HEARN"> Thank you. Mr. Hearn, you are recognized to begin
the testimony for the American Legion, please.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hearn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Hearn">Thank you. It is like deja vu, all over again.
Ranking Member Kuster, you made this assertion in your opening 
remarks during the March, 2016 hearing regarding Gulf War 
Illness. 486 days, one damning GAO report, and thousands of 
injured veterans and impacted dependents later, we are here 
again to discuss the adjudication of Gulf War Illness claims by 
VA. And yes, Ranking Member Kuster, it definitely feels like 
deja vu all over again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hearn">Chairman Chairmen Bergman and Bost, Ranking Member Kuster, 
and distinguished Members of the Subcommittees on Oversight and 
Investigations and Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs. 
On behalf of National Commander Charles E. Schmidt and the over 
two million members of the Nation's largest veteran's service 
organization, the American Legion appreciates the opportunity 
to testify regarding the adjudication of Gulf War Illness 
claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hearn">Gulf War Illness claims are inherently complicated. 
Veterans must tread murky waters to gain service-connection for 
many Gulf War related undiagnosed illnesses. An undiagnosed 
illness is just as it sounds, a cluster of symptoms that are 
unexplained and undefined. Veterans seeking treatment for these 
symptoms are often treated for years and often have multiple 
diagnoses before VA will acknowledge that the symptoms are 
related to an undiagnosed illness. It is terribly frustrating 
for veterans and as seen by a recent GAO report, overwhelmingly 
denied by VA when service-connection is sought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hearn">VA has previously acknowledged its frustrations with Gulf 
War Illness. With that in mind, one would think that there 
would be mandatory training to improve its workforce's 
understanding of the conditions. However, the GAO report 
indicated only about ten percent of VA's medical examiners 
successfully completed an optional course related to Gulf War 
Illness. This is pathetic. Only one of ten medical examiners 
have taken the optional course, but yet the other nine of ten 
are equally qualified to conduct Gulf War related examinations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hearn">Let us also not forget that many examinations are now being 
conducted by private sector contractors. If VA is not providing 
mandatory training regarding Gulf War Illness to its own 
employees, what requirements are being made of those examiners?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hearn">The American Legion has over 3,000 accredited 
representatives located throughout the Nation. These dedicated 
individuals are the lifeblood for staff in Washington. They are 
the souls that provide the necessary feedback regarding issues 
our veterans face regularly. One service officer reported that 
a VA regional office employee stated that veteran's service 
organizations receive more frequent and higher quality training 
than RO employees. Training received as a web based training 
that often results in various interpretations, ultimately 
resulting in inconsistent decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hearn">Each service officer spoken to prior to this hearing stated 
that they have had to accept that claims sought for undiagnosed 
illnesses will have to go to the Board of Veterans Appeals if 
they expect the claim to be granted, costing the veteran not 
months, but numerous years to possibly result in a positive 
decision. Veterans will provide lay statements detailing 
symptoms and impacts of symptoms from family members and 
friends. These statements will have little, if any, impact on 
RO decisions. However, the service officers report BVA 
decisions are much more favorable for veterans and take into 
account those lay statements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hearn">The GAO report combined with American Legion findings paint 
a bleak picture of the development in adjudication of Gulf War 
related claims. Medical providers have optional training, of 
which only ten percent participate, and VBA personnel complain 
of a lack of adequate training on the subject. Three 
generations of veterans have potentially been impacted by Gulf 
War Illness and these concerns have been swirling for over a 
quarter of a century. Think about this. A 20-year-old deployed 
troop right now in Iraq was not even born when these symptoms 
arose and may one day suffer, and we have yet to discover, A, 
the cause and proper treatment for it, and B, how to properly 
adjudicate the claims that are associated with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Hearn">It is evident that there is need for improvement and the 
American Legion is willing to work towards achieving these 
goals. In the last year VSOs worked with VA in designing an 
appeals modernization plan that we collectively achieved. We 
have proven for substantial change to occur it takes VSO and VA 
collaboration. The American Legion is eager to work with VA and 
VSOs to accomplish this feat. This is a problem that will not 
be resolved strictly by finger pointing. It is a problem that 
will be resolved by agreeing on identified problems and 
arriving at sensible solutions.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF MICHAEL S. FIGLIOLI</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MICHAEL S. FIGLIOLI"> Thank you, Mr. Hearn. Mr. Figlioli, you are
recognized to present the position for the VFW.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Figlioli</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">Thank you, Chairmen Bost and Bergman, Ranking
Members Esty and Kuster, Members of the Subcommittees. On 
behalf of the VFW, I would like to thank you for the 
opportunity to testify on VA's disability claims process with 
respect to Gulf War Illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">As professionally trained accredited advocates, VFW service 
officers have work extraordinarily hard to ensure our veterans 
and their families receive the maximum benefit allowable by law 
from VA. All too often, however, this does not happen for a 
myriad of reasons. For today's hearing I will focus on the 
signature condition of the Persian Gulf War referred to largely 
across the veterans community as Gulf War Illness, or more 
commonly in VA as medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom 
illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">Unlike nearly all other claimed conditions, Gulf War 
Illness is intrinsically difficult to diagnose and treat. Gulf 
War Illness has no clear and concise set of rules. In other 
words, no one distinctive set of symptoms that allow for a 
single, unmistakable diagnosis. Gulf War Illness presents 
itself as a conglomeration of possible symptoms to which 
countless members of the general public with no military 
experience can also be subject. As such, Persian Gulf veterans 
have a steeper hill to climb in relating the symptoms to 
service, the most critical link in establishing service-
connection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">None of this is remotely possible without the benefit of a 
VA exam. As VA continues to evolve on a number of fronts, such 
as electronic business management, VA developed disability 
benefits questionnaires, or DBQ, with an eye towards efficiency 
and timeliness. Last year the VFW strongly advocated for the 
elimination of the parsing out of symptoms and placing greater 
concentration on the clustering of these indicators of 
potentially one illness affecting multiple body symptoms as 
opposed to specific conditions related to each symptom. Put 
more simply, the VFW feels Gulf War Illness claimants would be 
better served by VA eliminating the assignment of multiple DBQs 
and posit from the outset that the evidence meets the criteria 
for Gulf War Illness. It remains our contentions that the 
current system of assigning separate DBQs for each symptom 
claimed in association with Gulf War Illness promotes 
incorrectly assigning a diagnosis to a condition linked to Gulf 
War Illness, which ultimately results in the veteran's claim 
being denied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">More than a year ago these Committees met to discuss this 
topic and pressed VA to develop a single DBQ for GWI that would 
assist in establishing service-connection. Regrettably, VA has 
not reported any progress in developing this DBQ and veterans 
continue to have their claims denied. VA continues to rely on a 
Gulf War Illness general medical DBQ that is not singular in 
nature for claims for Gulf War Illness but instead rely on a 
subjective non-medically trained construal of a claims 
assistant to interpret a veteran's claimed conditions and 
schedule the appropriate VA exam. When asked about the 
possibility of a more favorable DBQ the response of record was 
that VA would look into the issue, and first we had to confirm 
that the lack of a single DBQ is a real problem. Mr. Chairman, 
let us stop mincing words. We know this is a problem and GAO 
agrees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">This continued problem also has the downstream effect of 
the appellate process. VFW advocates at the Board of Veterans 
Appeals continue to find numerous inconsistencies when 
decisions are remanded to the VA regional office. In assessing 
pending appeals for Gulf War Illness, the VFW notes that VA 
appears to clearly favor finding a diagnosis for each reported 
symptom and thereby rule out Gulf War Illness rather than 
further developing and accurately applying the rating schedule 
with a diagnosis that is even a minimally supported one. The 
VFW urges VA to consider both possibilities as existential. 
Since the preponderance of evidence shows the possibility that 
Gulf War Illness may exist, the balance of evidence as to Gulf 
War Illness' non-existence is equal or in equipoise. Therefore, 
VA's own regulations show that VA should develop the claim for 
the potential grant of Gulf War Illness disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">The VFW suggested in prior testimony that inconsistencies 
in the application of the rating schedule is universal across 
the VA regional office spectrum with regard to claims for Gulf 
War Illness disabilities. While we are not in any way 
suggesting that this is deliberate, we continue to put forward 
that a grant for Gulf War Illness in Michigan should be exactly 
the same in New Hampshire, or any other VA regional office, 
based on the same evidence and fact pattern. VA's Office of 
Performance Analysis and Integrity has demonstrated their 
capability to track data nearly to the keystroke. This presents 
the perfect opportunity to identify and develop best practices 
across VA in properly adjudicating claims for Gulf War Illness 
and eliminate the disparities. At the very least with VA's 
national work queue, VA could easily distribute these 
specialized claims to the regional offices that have a proven 
track record in proper adjudication of Gulf War Illness claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">As one of the large Nation's VSOs responsible for providing 
direct assistance to veterans seeking their earned benefits, 
the VA thanks the Subcommittee for conducting oversight 
regarding Gulf War Illness claims. We ask that you join us in 
urging VA to adopt a single DBQ for all Gulf War Illness 
claims.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ANTHONY HARDIE"> Thank you, Mr. Figlioli. Mr. Hardie, you are
recognized for five minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hardie</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Hardie">Good morning, and thank you, Chairmen Bergman
and Bost, Ranking Members Kuster and Esty, and distinguished 
Members and staff for this hearing and the opportunity to speak 
with you today. Thank you, Gulf War veterans, we know you are 
watching live from all over the country and what happens here 
today matters to you most of all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hardie">I am Anthony Hardie, National Chairman and Director of 
Veterans for Common Sense, and a U.S. Army veteran of the Gulf 
War and Somalia. We appreciate last year's Gulf War hearings 
and today's follow-on hearing to try and fix these many 
unresolved issues. Included in our written statement are many 
identified issues and recommendations and pages of heartfelt, 
painful stories from Gulf War veterans from all over the 
country, written in their own words, just a few of the tens of 
thousands whose denied VA claims left them hurting, bewildered, 
distraught, and angry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hardie">A Maryland veteran describes what it is like to actually 
live with the chronic fatigue of Gulf War Illness, saying, ``I 
slept fourteen and a half hours, woke up for three, slept for 
another eight and a half. This is right off my Fitbit. Yet I 
have been denied each time. How am I supposed to work when I 
literally cannot get out of bed? This is not how I saw my life 
at 47 years old.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Hardie">They write about losing their health, their jobs, their 
finances, and even their homes. All write about VA improperly 
denying their presumptive Gulf War claims, exactly what GAO 
writes about in their report. One from Louisiana even writes 
about having to instruct a VA supervisor who had it wrong, and 
calling the White House seeking resolution. A Kentucky veteran 
wrote, ``I filed for a constellation of neurologic symptoms and 
was denied for each symptom of my undiagnosed illness.'' Others 
say the same thing or their symptoms being attributed to 
diagnosed conditions and then denied. That is the crux of the 
problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Hardie">It is now 23 years since Congress enacted the well-
intentioned 1994 law that created a presumption for undiagnosed 
illness symptoms. A written statement details later fine-tuning 
by Congress and VA. Today we have heard about GAO confirming 
VCS' earlier findings, that VA denies Gulf War Illness at a 
rate of greater than 80 percent. We see in their report that is 
three times the denial claim of any other claim, that the 
denial rates for undiagnosed illnesses are the worst of all, 
and that these trends are worsening over time and are now 
actually 87 percent overall, and get this, 90 percent for 
undiagnosed illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Hardie">We see from their report that these claims also take 50 
percent longer than other claims, meaning veterans who are the 
worst off suffer the longest, and that VA underreported Gulf 
War Illness claims by 57,000 issues, masking the true scope of 
this already egregious problem. The fact that VA developed 
evidence that led to these denials leaves the door open for 
potential litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Hardie">Given GAO's findings that VA has not heeded external or 
even internal recommendations, a finding that mirrors our 
exasperated experiences, we are glad VA leaders seem to be 
stepping up to the plate to fix GAO's three basic 
recommendations. However, in reviewing VA's disability benefits 
questionnaires using claims processing, many if not most for 
diagnosed health conditions begin with this first basic 
question, does the veteran have this diagnosis? But that basic 
question obviously does not work for undiagnosed illness 
claims. And when GAO reports that some claims examiners will 
never find in favor of an undiagnosed illness, and will always 
attribute a veteran's symptoms to a diagnosable illness, that 
is most damning, showing that it is inevitable these claims 
will continue to be denied at near total rates no matter how 
much training is conducted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Hardie">Collectively this decades-long body of evidence makes it 
clear. Undiagnosed illness as a judicable VA claim simply does 
not and cannot work. It is now beyond clear what we need to do. 
A statutory fix along the lines of what we propose in our 
written testimony is needed or we are going to keep having 
these investigations and hearings that all say essentially the 
same thing, decade after decade. We ask that Congress work in a 
bipartisan manner with President Trump to enact legislation to 
once and for all fix Gulf War Illness claims and the many other 
Gulf War issues we raise in this and previous testimony. And if 
VA is serious about resolving these issues, and the ones that 
the veteran raises in the last paragraph I am about to read, 
then VA leaders should leap at the chance to work with 
stakeholders and Congress to craft this legislation together if 
for no other reason than the human impact of VA's denial of 
nearly all Gulf War Illness claims is all too real.</paragraph>
</Statement>
    <Statement>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Anthony Hardie appears in the</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Anthony Hardie appears in th">    Listen carefully to these words written by a fellow 
Wisconsin veteran. ``I was told there is a two-year wait before 
my appeal will even be opened, and that it's now up to four 
years. Over the last ten years I have lost two jobs and have 
lost my home and land due to bankruptcy. We have had to move 
twice and change schools, which is really tough for my kids. I 
feel like I am on the verge of losing another job and I am 
afraid I cannot rebuild things again. My VA psychologist told 
me Wednesday that it was an awful long time to hold onto life 
by my fingernails and I agreed. I have put a belt around my 
neck twice and told my doctor Wednesday that I would blow my 
brains out if I am denied again. Twenty-two per day do not kill 
themselves because of PTSD. It is for being continually denied 
and called a liar by the administration that is supposed to be 
helping us. Veterans, and particularly those of war like me, 
look at life very differently than most. If I have no hope, I 
will not continue to be a burden on myself, my family, or my 
country. I will, however, do my best to let them know I was 
destroyed by the VA.''

    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bost"> As soon as I turn my microphone on I will start.
I do want to thank you all for being here and for your 
testimony. But I do want to start with a question. Mr. Hearn, 
do you think the VBA's adjudication manual provides useful 
guidance for VBA employees related to the Gulf War Illness?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hearn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Hearn">When preparing for the testimony I was reviewing
the manual and I think it is fairly clunky in the way that it 
is written. And I question as to whether to not aspects of 
Joyner or more recent cases is applied properly in there and 
alerts the staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Hearn">    I understand why the raters, and more importantly the VSRs, 
are having difficulty understanding what to do. And I think 
when you look at the VSO, the VSO does not use the manual when 
advocating for a case. And you know else does not? The Board of 
Veterans Appeals. So it is funny that the one aspect that seems 
to be different is this manual and a VBA rater. So that 
certainly is a concern with the way that VA goes about dealing 
with these types of cases.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bost"> Mr. Flohr, how do you respond to his statement
about where we are at with this right now?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Flohr">Thank you, sir. First of all, I would like to
say that a week before last I had my 42nd anniversary working 
at the Department of Veterans Affairs, all of them here in 
Washington, D.C. All kinds of jobs, from a basic adjudicator to 
where I am now. And we used to have a very, you know, the 
manual, or adjudication procedures manual was all in paper, it 
took forever to make changes to get them to our adjudicators 
out in the field and our field stations. Now it is a live 
manual. We call it a live manual because it is live. It is 
online. We make changes easily, whenever we find a change that 
needs to be made, we can do it. We have a large staff that can 
do that. It is very much superior to what we used to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Flohr">Is it perfect? Now. Nothing is going to be really always 
perfect, because there are always changes. There is either a 
court decision, or new legislation that is going to require us 
to make changes to what we currently have. But we do a lot of 
training. We have a very large training staff that works very 
hard to train our adjudicators and our rating specialists in 
making the right decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Flohr">These claims are difficult. For example, an undiagnosed 
illness. Any of you who are physicians know that when a veteran 
presents, or anyone presents, to you with a constellation of 
symptoms, the first thing you do is try to diagnose it. Because 
if you cannot diagnose it, you cannot treat it. If you treat 
it, you possibly could do some hard if you treat it with the 
wrong type of medication. So that is one reason why it is so 
difficult, undiagnosed illness claims. We request an 
examination. The examiners do all indicated tests to try and 
determine what the veteran has. And if they cannot, we ask them 
to report to use the veteran has an undiagnosed illness of the 
respiratory system, the cardiovascular system, whatever body 
system it may be. And when that gets relayed to us, we grant 
the claim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Flohr">    As I said, unfortunately a diagnosis often is made. And 
then when a diagnosis is made, then the direct service-
connection criteria of statute comes into play. We must find 
evidence that the veteran had that particular disability while 
they were in service, they currently have it now, and then 
determine how disabling it is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bost"> Mr. Flohr, I do not want to interrupt but I do
have another question I have to get to while my time is 
limited. You know, the VA issued a training letter on February, 
2010 that details VA should develop a claim for Gulf War 
Illness. For example, the letter instructs VA employees on when 
to request a disability exam for Gulf War Illness. However, GAO 
found that employees have different interpretations of VBA's 
policy despite VBA's steps to clarify that with guidance. I 
think we can all agree that adequate exams, if one was 
requested, are critical to correctly process these claims. The 
Fast letter that was issued seven years ago, even despite the 
lack of additional clear guidance in the manual, so why is it 
that VA employees still have such difficulty knowing when to 
request an exam for these claims?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> That is a good question. As I said, our live
manual is pretty clear, at least in my view. But one of the 
other, it was not a recommendation made by GAO, but it was an 
expression that we should do perhaps a consistency study on 
when to schedule an examination.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bost">Maybe Ms. Emrey-Arras--I love just messing that
up. I am so sorry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bost">    Ms. Emrey-Arras. Melissa is fine.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bost">Okay. Melissa, what do you think the reason is?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bost">    Ms. Emrey-Arras. VA told us that they were in fact planning 
to do a consistency study to evaluate just this issue, about 
consistency in referrals for medical exams. And they told us 
that they would be doing it the third quarter of this fiscal 
year. So I think that is an excellent question to ask of VA, in 
terms of what is the status of that consistency study.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> I am glad to tell you that it was completed in
April, which was in the third quarter. We gave it to a lot of 
our VSRs, our veteran service representatives, when there was a 
wrong answer. And as with most consistency studies, you find 
some answers that are not quite right, and particular in Gulf 
War claims which are very complex. But after the exam was 
given, then the people who took the exam were taken to a room 
and provided post-examination training to ensure that they knew 
the right answer, what it is going forward, they would not make 
the same mistakes again. So that was completed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bost"> Can we get the results of those studies for the
record, please?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Yes. I will be glad to provide those.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bost</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Bost"> Okay. Thank you. My time is actually expired, and
I hate to do that to Ms. Esty when she first walks through the 
door. But Ms. Kuster did have to leave to another meeting. 
Ranking Member Esty is here, if she is ready for--I was going 
to hope to do that for you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Esty</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Esty">Thank you all very much. I appreciate you being
here. Sorry, this is the fourth or fifth--I started at six a.m. 
this morning. So it is just one of those days. It is going to 
be long. NDAA days are long with many different commitments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Esty">I really want to thank all of you very much for your 
efforts and for really partnering with us. This Committee 
prides itself on bipartisanship and on getting things done for 
veterans, and making sure the VA works well, and that we are 
serving people the way we need to. And as technology changes, 
and as the needs of our veterans change, and who that 
population is, that is going to change over time. And we will 
not always get it right but we are always going to try. And we 
count on you doing the same thing, too, and giving us a little 
nudge sometimes when we do not, and figuring out how we can all 
do this better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Esty">An issue I want to really look at it, because I hear about 
it all the time in my district, and we have talked about it 
before in hearings here, is on decision letters. And on the 
lack of clarity in decision letters. I am a lawyer. I read 
those decision letters, I cannot tell what they mean. How can 
our veterans know what they mean? It is disrespectful and it 
leads to appeals and leads to frustration and a feeling of 
disrespect. So if people could talk a little bit about what 
actually can we do? This is an incredibly high priority for me, 
not just because I am the Subcommittee Ranking Member and I 
want us to deal with those claims. Because it is just wrong to 
be sending out letters that do not have clarity. So what can we 
do to get greater clarity in average people speak? This should 
not, you should not have to have a Ph.D. to figure out what 
these letters mean. And I do think it is disrespectful, which 
is number one a problem. Number two, it leads to appeals. And 
it leads people to disengage. So we have to find a better way 
forward. So I would love to hear your thoughts on this, as we 
are moving forward to make changes here. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Esty">    Ms. Emrey-Arras. This is Melissa Emrey-Arras, GAO. I would 
say that we found that the letters did not specifically inform 
veterans that their claims had been considered in terms of 
presumptive eligibility. And the language made it seem like 
only direct service-connection had been considered. So if you 
were a veteran expecting a presumptive claim, and you saw the 
letter, you would think that that was not evaluated 
appropriately.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> And VA accepted that recommendation and we have
plans to change our letters by the end of August to provide 
that information. But I think perhaps we need to look at it in 
more detail to see where we can make it even more clearer and 
we will do that as well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Figlioli</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Figlioli"> Ms. Esty, Mike Figlioli from the VFW. This is
a great concern to our organization, as it is to the American 
Legion and the other VSOs. The number one thing about these 
letters, as you said, they are convoluted. They are not written 
in English. They are not written in plain language that the 
average citizen can understand. And it is not just related to 
Gulf War Illness. This is for every disability. This is for 
every communication with the VA. Every letter has to meet 
certain requirements. But they can outline in that letter, to 
prove your claim you need to provide, A, B, C, and D, not the 
standard cut and paste blurb that there is evidence of record 
but we had to deny the claim because there is no diagnosis that 
this was occurred or was caused by service. That tells the 
veteran nothing. We have been after the VA for a number of 
years to make them simpler, make them straightforward, and 
allow the veteran to understand the shortcoming and then 
correct the deficiency so that we can go ahead and approve the 
claim. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hearn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Hearn">Good morning, Ranking Member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Hearn">One of the issues that we have noticed over time and 
especially in the appeals inventory is that the VA kind of shot 
themselves in the foot with these letters, right? Because a lot 
of veterans are appealing cases or appealing their claims, but 
they don't know what they are appealing, they don't know why 
they are appealing. They just know that they feel like they 
kind of got messed over by VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Hearn">And so, like Mike was saying, they will sit there and they 
will say to gain service-connection, you must have the 
following. Well, why don't they identify it? Okay, you have a 
diagnosis, you have an incident of service, but yet we don't 
have a doctor's note linking the two conditions. And I think 
that is what is creating a lot of confusion. Like you said, you 
know, you shouldn't have to have a PhD or some sort of advanced 
degree just to be able to figure this out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Hearn">    And, unfortunately, this has been a problem that we have 
been calling for years and years and years, and really in the 
appeals modernization, that was a caveat for this whole thing. 
And so we are very much looking forward to it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Esty</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Esty">Can I respectfully suggest that when VA has a
draft letter ready they circulate it to this Committee and they 
circulate it to the VSOs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. Esty">And I fully agree, I think it ought to be broken out with a 
checklist with numbered, so you can actually visibly see this 
criteria must be met, the following was/was not met. These 
would be documentation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Esty">So it is really clear and it is really easy to do a 
checklist that is the military way. Don't bury it in the middle 
of a paragraph in lawyerese. Break it out so that you can 
easily understand what that means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Esty">So I would urge the VA to circulate that to us. I know I 
work with some behavioral economists, I want them to take a 
look at it, and I would like to have some actual veterans look 
at it and say, does this make sense to you? If you read this, 
what would you understand that you need to do? And I think that 
would help us all get to the objective we share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Esty">Thanks very much and I see I am over time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Ms. Esty">    My apologies, Chairman Bergman. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Bergman">No apology is necessary. You know, quality,
you should never put a time limit on good quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Mr. Coffman, you are recognized for five minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Coffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Coffman">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Coffman">And I just want to say first, as a Gulf War veteran, how 
disappointed certainly I was in the aftermath of the war and to 
this day that the Department of Defense I think participated in 
a cover-up, and that cover-up was the exposure to chemical 
weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Coffman">And that I can remember the Marine Corps limit of advance 
in the first Gulf War was kind of the northern end of Kuwait on 
the Iraqi border and I can remember in the aftermath of the 
fighting, and you have tremendous visibility in the open 
desert, seeing this white cloud close to the ground, not 
moving, and reported that in. And I didn't think there was a 
question at that time--well, we knew, I knew later on, years 
later on what it was, and it was that combat engineers of the 
United States Army were blowing chemical weapons in place 
because they didn't want to go through the hassle of all the 
decontamination stuff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Coffman">And so we were fortunate, the Marines I was with were 
fortunate that we were not downwind from it, that the wind 
patterns were moving in the other direction. So none of the 
Marines I served with came down with Gulf War Illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Coffman">But the Department of Defense denied for I believe about a 
five-year period in the aftermath of the war that the U.S. 
troops were ever exposed to chemical weapons and it wasn't 
until, you know, they were forced to admit it later on that 
they in fact were, that they did blow chemical weapons in 
place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Coffman">And so we got off to a very bad start in terms of research, 
that that was not one of the aspects that were researched, 
because the Department of Defense was so vehement in denying 
that that was in fact true. And so it certainly left a bad 
taste in my mouth as a Gulf War veteran in terms of the 
integrity of the United States Government relative to veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Coffman">    And so, but I think my question at this point is, in the 
training of these disability folks that do the processing, 
review the claims, there doesn't seem to be any uniformity in 
the training. And as I understand it, there is a course that is 
optional for them to take and I think it is online. And I guess 
let me ask the VA, why isn't there mandatory training for the 
folks that review these claims?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Thank you. Are you referring to the training for
medical examiners who provide medical opinions or the people 
that make the decisions?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Coffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Coffman"> Well, I think that is a good question. How is
it for both?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Well, for us, for VBA, every time we hire a new
group of individuals, we have a very large training staff and 
they get sent away to either Baltimore or Denver, we have 
training academies there. They go through a lot of training, at 
least six weeks--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Coffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Coffman"> Relative to the Gulf War?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> To all particular claims, all types of claims.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Coffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Coffman"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> So they get an initial group of training, then
every year they are required to complete training as well and 
updates.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Coffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Coffman">Okay. GAO, maybe you can respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Coffman">    Ms. Emrey-Arras. The medical examiners are not required to 
take training specific to Gulf War Illness issues. It is 
elective and, because of their high caseloads and the fact that 
they don't have a lot of time for elective training, only about 
ten percent of the medical examiners have taken training on 
Gulf War Illness.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Coffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Coffman"> American Legion?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hearn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Hearn">Thank you, Congressman. The training--and that
is something that we have a lot of concerns about and I 
addressed it during my remarks was that on the medical side, I 
mean, you have to remember these are doctors and doctors are a 
lot like mechanics, right? You don't take your car in to the 
mechanic and say fix my brakes, and the guy comes out and says, 
I don't know what it is. That goes against their DNA, they 
naturally are going to create a diagnosis. I think that is just 
how they operate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Hearn">So if the doctor comes back and says, I don't know, that is 
a pretty rare circumstance. But then what the big concern is, 
is that you have VA as a department has said this is a priority 
of ours, but then only ten percent have taken it? It kind of 
makes you wonder if there is just lip service being paid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Hearn">    And then the second aspect of it is that we have started 
going to these contracted examinations. If they can't get it 
right with their own employees, what is going to happen when 
QTC or one of these other providers in the private sector are 
having these examinations, are they getting the proper 
training? And so which Gulf War veterans are going to be 
impacted by these private sector physicians?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Coffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Coffman"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is up. I
yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Thank you, Mr. Coffman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Ms. Brownley, you are recognized for five minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Brownley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. Brownley">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. Brownley">And thank you all for being here this morning. This is a 
very important topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. Brownley">    So the GAO presented VBA with a set of recommendations on 
this issue and you have said and agreed to all of those 
recommendations. Can you in a general way, can you give me an 
idea of when you might complete all of these recommendations 
and have them operating in a way that is more effective?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Flohr">Yes. Thank you for that question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Flohr">We did accept and concur with the three recommendations. We 
appreciate GAO's looking at this, they are always instrumental 
in helping us do a better job of what we do and we appreciate 
that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Flohr">    The recommendation to ensure that VHA medical examiners 
take this 90-minute training has been accepted by VHA, it is 
going to be made mandatory, and as--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Brownley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Brownley"> Do you think 90 minutes is enough?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Flohr">I will let Dr. Joyce answer that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Flohr">Dr. Joyce. I would like to address that. The 90-minute 
training course described by others as being optional is a mere 
fraction of the training required to do a Gulf War examination 
or any other kind of CMP examiner. These physicians, nurse 
practitioners, or physician's assistants are first licensed, 
privileged, and experienced before they do Gulf War 
examinations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Flohr">    This additional course of 90 minutes will be mandatory and 
will be completed by November, but it is supplemental to their 
underlying training as health care professionals which allow 
them to address this very complex subject, a subject that is 
not easy to define and has challenged even the learned 
colleagues at the National Academy of Medicine.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Flohr">As far as number two, I think I already said we
concur with that as well and we will have our decision 
notification letters completed, changes made to them by the end 
of next month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Flohr">    And number three is the single case definition. We do have 
a plan to do that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Brownley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. Brownley"> What is the plan?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> The plan is to get a lot of smart people
together and try and figure it out.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Brownley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. Brownley"> What is the timeline?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Flohr">The timeline is March of 2018 right now. But,
you know, we asked the National Academy of Sciences to do this 
several years ago, they couldn't do it. It was that difficult, 
so they threw it back to us, and we are going to try and do 
that. We are going to get people from DoD, people from the 
Veterans Health Administration, from VBA, from the National 
Academies, if we can, whoever we can get who is smart about 
this. People from our War-Related Injury and Illness study 
centers here in D.C. and New Jersey, Palo Alto, they see a lot 
of Gulf War veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Flohr">    So we really will appreciate their input in trying to come 
up with a single case definition, but we do have a plan and we 
have already started.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Brownley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. Brownley">Well, certainly my expectation is that the VA
would be the experts when it comes to Gulf War Illness and the 
VA should not have to look to other entities for that, the 
research. I mean, this is what it is all about is, you know, 
why the VA in its mission, is because they are serving our 
veterans with all kinds of illnesses, but there are specialty 
illnesses that are just not out in the world other than within 
the VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Ms. Brownley">And I think, you know, back to the medical training, yeah, 
I agree that the doctors that come to the VA are well-trained 
doctors, I don't dispute that for a second, but a 90-minute, 
Web-based course to me seems like it is really not deep enough, 
you know, to really understand, you know, sort of what veterans 
are going through and understanding it. But certainly it is a 
step in the right direction to require that everybody take the 
course, so I certainly agree with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. Brownley">    Dr. Joyce. I am in complete agreement with you: it is not 
sufficient to take that 90-minute course and to call yourself a 
Gulf War examiner. It is a mere supplemental course to make us 
better able to answer the technical questions from the Veterans 
Benefits Administration and I would be doing a disservice to my 
colleagues to suggest you could be certified that quickly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Brownley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. Brownley"> So with regard to the manual has been spoken
of and you talked about it being live, you can make changes as 
we go. The American Legion described it as clunky, you 
described it as clear. Do you really think the manual is 
fundamentally, absolutely clear?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> It is large, it is very large and it is full of
a lot of information. And I have not processed claims myself 
for many, many years, so I don't necessarily always use the 
live manual if I want to look up something. Like I looked up 
what was in there on Gulf War Illness before I came here and 
there is a lot of information there that needs to be digested, 
and it may at times lead people to be somewhat confused. I am 
not sure about that, again, but there is a lot there and when 
we need to change something, we can do it immediately, and that 
is what is the best part about it. Plus, everyone else can see 
it as well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Brownley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. Brownley"> Well, I think that is good, the transparency
piece is good.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Brownley</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. Brownley">But, you know, clarity is also important. And
I think that all goes back to the definition and other kinds of 
things, you know, that we are talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. Brownley">And I know my time is up, but I would just like to hear 
from VBA, not now but if you can get back to me. You know, the 
opening of this hearing started about a deja vu, that we have 
had this conversation, we had it a year ago, and I would really 
like to know the work that has been done since last year up 
until this point. Now we are talking about a year later, we are 
talking about meeting some recommendations yet into the future. 
But, you know, I would like to have that conversation offline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. Brownley">    And I apologize, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Thank you, Ms. Brownley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Dr. Dunn, you are recognized for five minutes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Dunn">Thank you very much, General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Dunn">I would like to channel a comment made by Mr. Hearn a 
little earlier where doctors don't like to say they don't know 
and you are absolutely right, we don't like that, but we can be 
trained to say that. And my next comment is directed to Dr. 
Joyce and Mr. Flohr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Dunn">So I want to stipulate something just among us here. Can we 
agree we do not understand Gulf War Illness Syndrome is a 
disease? None of us do and there are no experts anywhere that 
have some comprehensive understanding of the pathology of this 
disease. Do you agree with that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Dunn">    Dr. Joyce. I do, Dr. Dunn.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Dunn">You do. Okay, good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Dunn">So, now we all agree that the claims are rising, the 
denials are rising as well. Clearly, some of our Gulf War 
veterans are not having their conditions properly recognized 
and treated, we can agree on that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Dunn">    Dr. Joyce. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Dunn">Yes? We can agree clearly that some of the
veterans are not being recognized and treated for Gulf War 
Illness Syndrome?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Dunn">    Dr. Joyce. Some, but not all.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Dunn">Some, some? Not all of them, some?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Dunn">    Dr. Joyce. Dr. Dunn, using the word ``some'' as we medical 
doctors do, I will agree with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Dunn">Thank you, thank you. In medical terminology.
That's good, because I haven't been up here long enough to use 
anything other than that kind of terminology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Dunn">So given that and we know that the DoD has spent between 
'94 and 2016 over $172 million on research in hopes of simply 
clarifying the presumptive list of conditions, sort of that 
basket of pathologies that fit into Gulf War Illness Syndrome, 
and we have made no new changes or additions in seven years, 
since 2010, you know, my question is this, that can we, can 
you, can we together promptly finalize some diagnostic criteria 
for Gulf War Illness Syndrome and then address the prompt 
rollout of administrative, financial, and medical action to 
help these deserving soldiers?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Dunn">    Emphasis on prompt.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> You are talking about prompt training for
medical providers, examiners?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Dunn"> So you do have to. But just going back to Mr.
Hearn's remark, you know, doctors don't like to say they don't 
know, but if you go to a doctor and say nobody knows, not just 
you in this clinic, nobody knows Gulf War Illness Syndrome, but 
here's this basket of symptoms that fit this criteria, use this 
Chinese menu of pathologies, and if your soldiers fit these 
criteria and they were in the Gulf War, then they presumptively 
have Gulf War Illness Syndrome and they get their financial 
disability, whatever, and medical treatment such as we know at 
the time going forward. And we know there will be advances. I 
spent my evening reading the proteomic and genomic and microRNA 
studies on Gulf War Illness Syndrome, fascinating stuff, but 
not clinically relevant just yet, but it is okay. I think you 
can go to your doctors, I have worked at a VA hospital, and say 
nobody knows, not just you. Can you make this diagnosis and 
help this soldier?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Well, you know, the Gulf War Illness is
described in statute and regulations. If a veteran has a 
chronic, multi-symptom--medically unexplained, chronic, multi-
symptom illness, which is defined in the statute as, such as--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Dunn">Pretty clearly, the system isn't working yet for
them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Dunn">    Mr. Flohr [continued]. --fibromyalgia--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Dunn"> I mean, so defining it in statute, maybe getting
the lawyers involved was the wrong group, maybe we need to get 
the doctors involved in it, you know.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> That would be good, but if a veteran has one of
those fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or functional GI 
disorders, if a veteran of the Gulf War--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Dunn">Things we sort of understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Dunn">    Mr. Flohr [continued]. --has one of those, that is 
presumptive and we should be granting those immediately. And if 
we are not, please let me know, if you can--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Dunn">All right. So my charge I guess would be, you
know, and I heard you suggest you might do this by March of '18 
to Ms. Brownley's question, is to roll this out really, really 
promptly. No more fooling around with it, we have been fooling 
around with it for a long, long time. We need to take some 
clear action to help these poor soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Dunn">    And in my final 45 seconds I would like to ask, I guess 
you, Mr. Flohr, what would you have us say to our constituents 
who perceive that they have a medical condition, Gulf War 
Illness Syndrome, arising from their service in the Gulf War, 
and yet that is not being recognized by the VA? And that 
happens to us on a weekly basis.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Well, I would say--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Dunn"> All of us, not just my office.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Flohr">Sure, I understand. I would say to them that if
they have a disability they think resulted from their Gulf War 
service and if it has been diagnosed a chronic, multi-symptom 
illness, they certainly need to provide that medical evidence 
when they file their claim from their private provider or 
whoever it might be. If they only have symptoms, if they don't 
have a diagnosed illness, then we are going to do what we need 
to do, which is request an examination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Flohr">    And then under the law, if after all indicated tests are 
done the examiner cannot arrive at a diagnosis, we want--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Dunn"> But this should be cookbook, I mean, really, it
should be cookbook, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Yes, it should.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Dunn"> Okay. Well, let's get the cookbook out there
and--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> But it is not easy. That's the thing, it is not
easy.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Dunn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Dunn">That is why we went to med school. All right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Dunn">    Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Thanks, Dr. Dunn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Mr. Sablan, you are recognized for five minutes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sablan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Sablan">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Sablan">Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Sablan">I am new to this Committee and I asked to join because I 
have seen a spike of veterans coming to the congressional 
office asking for help. They go see a doctor or a medical 
professional and they are told, no, nothing is wrong with them. 
And here we are discovering that nobody really knows the entire 
story or whatever it makes of some of the illnesses from the 
Gulf War. And I am talking about Gulf War veterans primarily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Sablan">I had a week two months ago dedicated to just talking to 
veterans in a group setting, in a one-to-one basis, and all of 
these veterans have filed claims and they are still suffering. 
Some of them suffer in quiet, they quietly suffer because they 
are told nothing is wrong with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Sablan">Now, Dr. Joyce mentioned that a VA physician who usually 
examines a Gulf War syndrome or illness specializes in this 
issue. So let me ask you--and that the GAO reports that only 
ten percent do these Web service training--so let me ask you, 
contracted medical examiners, I mean private doctors who are 
contracted to do this, because I don't have a VA clinic in my 
district, what makes you determine that that doctor knows what 
they are doing, a general internist, internal medicine doctor?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Sablan">    Dr. Joyce. So as a general rule Gulf War exams are an 
exemption to the regular contract exams done to these non-
specialist and CMP exams.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sablan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Sablan">Okay, but if they go see a doctor and the
doctor said nothing is wrong with them, they can't get a 
referral to go to Hawaii. Some of these people have no money to 
go to Hawaii, you know. It costs $2,000 to go to Hawaii. Plus 
you have to get a car, you have to rent a hotel, get lodging 
and everything, and you need an appointment. And the doctor is 
saying nothing is wrong with you. So someone has to make that 
appointment in Hawaii for them, they have to go to a doctor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Sablan">    Dr. Joyce. I think I am going to have to say that we are 
going to have to get back to you, because I am not personally 
familiar with the referral system in your area.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sablan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Sablan">Well, I am sure that there are other private
doctors in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Sablan">And again, Mr. Flohr, thank you, sir, for your 42 years of 
service, but let me ask you. GAO recommends that there should 
be a requirement that medical examiners complete training 
courses before conducting these exams for Gulf illness or such 
a medical conduct--complete training, including such as the 90-
minute Gulf War Illness Web-based course, and only ten percent 
do it. What do you do to the 90 percent who won't do it? Do you 
give them a bonus? I heard you guys give out lots of bonuses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Sablan">    Dr. Joyce. I can address that. When the course is now 
mandatory, we will be required, myself included, to demonstrate 
on a computerized record list that goes all the way to the 
central office that we have completed the course and passed the 
test showing we took the course; no one will be exempt.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sablan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Sablan">Thank you, Doctor. I am not pointing fingers,
Doctor, I am making just statements because I come from a 
place, I represent a district where there is no VA clinic and 
to go to Guam, to go to Hawaii requires a lot of money, and 
these people don't have money. So they have absolutely no help 
and so they suffer in silence. And they come to me, and 
especially when they are told nothing is wrong with them, they 
come to me and say, what can I do? What can you do for me? And, 
you know, I can't file appeal papers for them, I don't have 
their documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Sablan">    And does it take the GAO to tell you these things? You have 
42 years of service, sir. Do you really need the GAO to tell 
you some of these things that you have failed to do, that we 
have discussed a year ago?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> That the medical--that is Dr. Joyce's claim but,
you know, we work with VHA to make sure that we get all that we 
need to make proper decisions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sablan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Sablan">Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be, you know,
very--if I appear critical, I don't mean to be. I am just 
expressing. And I took the stories of veterans word-for-word, I 
added nothing, I took out nothing, and I presented them to 
Secretary Kelly--I mean Shulkin, I'm sorry, I am mistaken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Sablan">But I really need help in my district and I don't know what 
else to do. I joined this Committee trying to find help, not to 
be critical of anybody, and I appreciate that you guys are 
doing this. I thank GAO also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Sablan">I am over my time, but I will tell you that some of the 
best information I have learned over this series of hearings 
have come from these people, the VSOs. Unfortunately, I only 
have the VFW in my district, many of them are Vietnam veterans. 
But I have put together a list of all VSOs in the Nation and it 
is going on my Web site, and I am telling these veterans join 
or go to these VSOs for help. I can't do your things for you, 
but they could be helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Sablan">    Mr. Chairman, I apologize for being out of time, General. 
Thank you, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Bergman">No apology is necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Bergman">My parents raised me to be kind. As a Boy Scout, I was 
courteous. So I am going to try very hard to maintain my 
parents' and my scout master's values here in my questioning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Bergman">You can tell by the questions from our Members, there is a 
sense of urgency in this panel, a true sense of urgency; I am 
not sure I feel that throughout the room.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    So, Mr. Flohr, Dr. Joyce, I am going to look at you first. 
Do you feel a personal sense of urgency in this?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Yes. And not just for Gulf War veterans--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Mr. Flohr [continued]. --but all veterans.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Good enough. Yes, okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Bergman">So now, since you do, can you give me any examples at the 
VA over the last, pick your time, two years, ten years that 
actually would show a sense of urgency from the top on down to 
get some results?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Let me try it in a different way. Can you give me an 
innovative program, innovative, that was based on a sense of 
urgency to shrink the timeframe to develop the capabilities for 
the individual practitioners necessary to begin to get a handle 
on this problem? Can you give me one example of innovation 
other than a 90-minute, optional, online training program?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> I can give you an example of an innovation that
is currently underway. It is called--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Bergman"> Underway?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Bergman"> How about in execution phase? Is underway
meaning we are working it up or does underway mean actually 
being--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> It means that we are working with the Department
of Defense, the Veterans Health Administration, to achieve an 
electronic availability of determining someone had an exposure 
while they were on Active duty.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Bergman"> That's it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Flohr">Yes, sir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Flohr">    Dr. Joyce. I would also add that in the testimony of Mr. 
Flohr so far the increase in number of claims for Gulf War 
Illness is a demonstrable manifestation that more have been 
accepted--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Bergman"> Great segue, thank you very much, because in
the military we--and you have heard this term, in fact General 
Petraeus coined the term when he looked at changing how we were 
looking at Operational Iraqi Freedom and he talked about 
creating the surge, if you will, can you give me an example of 
surge operations that have been instituted within the VA? Not 
just asking for more money and more people, but taking already 
existing assets that you have and that you pay every day of the 
week, and redistribute those assets in a surge manner to begin 
to grab a handle on this?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> I don't know if it meets what you are looking
for, but we--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Bergman">I am looking for a surge--</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Mr. Flohr [continued]. --over the past several years--</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Mr. Bergman [continued]. --of existing assets that you are 
refocus--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Bergman"> --based upon a perceived need. Again, in war
fighting, it is real simple: if the enemy is over here, bring 
your stuff over here to go after them.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> What we have done over the last several years
now is develop training academies for newly hired employees 
where they get the training they need to make proper decisions 
in a group setting, they get tested. It is working out very 
well for us.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Bergman"> Is there a sense of urgency?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> It is urgent that we get them trained, so they
can--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Is there a sense of urgency?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Mr. Flohr [continued]. --process claims, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Bergman">You feel a sense. Sensing is a feeling.
Someone can write the word ``urgent,'' but unless you sense 
urgency, that is where I am going with this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    And from the top down, if the leaders and the people in 
charge do not have a sense of urgency that is not going to 
filter down into the organization. It doesn't come from the 
bottom up, it comes from that leadership at the top.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> I believe that Secretary Shulkin definitely has
a sense of urgency and he is relaying that down to all of us.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Bergman">It is too bad it took this long to get the
Secretary, if you will. Now, I agree with you, Secretary 
Shulkin does have a sense of urgency. I am trying to reinforce 
our support for his efforts to develop that sense of urgency 
throughout the VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Here's a question for you and I don't care who answers 
this. What is the single biggest challenge for us moving 
forward here? I am going to give you two of my choices: apathy 
or bureaucratic red tape?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hardie</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Hardie">Mr. Chairman, Anthony from Veterans for Common
Sense. I would like to suggest that, again, the biggest 
challenge is that undiagnosed illness, since 1994, it doesn't 
work and all the training in the world isn't going to fix it, 
all the solutions, we can rewrite manuals all day long. It 
simply doesn't work because these conditions are diagnosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Hardie">    I had a veteran this morning who contacted me and said, ``I 
was diagnosed with sleep apnea, it is one of those nine 
conditions that are listed under sleep disorders, why can't I 
get this done?'' And I explained to him, well, it was diagnosed 
and therefore doesn't qualify under undiagnosed illness. And he 
said, ``well, that makes no sense.'' And I said, ``That's the 
point.''
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Bergman"> So is it apathy or is it bureaucratic red tape
that is causing that? Anybody want to throw one out there? It's 
okay, there are no right or wrong answers here. It is what you 
perceive based upon your understanding and research into this 
issue.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Figlioli</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">Mr. Chairman, Mike from VFW. I would say it
is bureaucratic red tape, in my opinion, VFW's opinion, too 
many steps. The manual, as was said, is clunky, confusing. 
Training is not conducted in a way that they can recognize 
either it is or it is not Gulf War Illness and roadblocks 
abound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">If it was made simpler, if the DBQ was developed to the 
point that said this is in fact Gulf War Illness, or if we 
started from Gulf War Illness and worked backwards, it might be 
less so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Figlioli">    This has actually not been going on since last year, this 
has actually been going on since 1997, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Question for Mr. Flohr, probably, and Dr. Joyce. What would 
be the cost, dollar cost to just presumptively assume that all, 
all Gulf War veterans had a base level of Gulf War Illness, 
what would be the cost?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> I would have no idea.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Bergman"> Would you take that for the record?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> I could take it to our staff that works on those
costs.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Bergman"> Good. And I don't care whether it is ten
percent, twenty percent, I don't care--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> Are you talking about any disability claim by a
Gulf War veteran?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Get them into the system, presumptively assume
that because they were there, they were exposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    Now, again, we are product of our own experiences. I am 
Agent Orange, I am Vietnam. Okay?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Flohr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Flohr"> I can tell you that right now Gulf War veterans
are service-connected for more than 14 million disabilities.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Give me a cost to presumptively assume, if it
is on your DD214 that you were there in that specific 
timeframe. Because when we talk about, number one, what are we 
providing, what is the cost of providing it, and how quickly 
are we going to come to some resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Wait time, wait time is not--you know, wait time, as a 
friend of mine, one of my Vietnam squadron mates told me about 
a month ago, he is still grieving for the recent loss of his 
wife to cancer and he is writing a book on our experiences in 
Vietnam, but his quote he is going to use for all to know, and 
I think it relates to his grieving for the loss of his spouse, 
is you think you have time, but you don't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Bergman">I would suggest to you that that sense of urgency and 
thinking about how much time you have, but you really don't, we 
need more. We need a lot more and we need it sooner, and you 
can do it with quality, I know you can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Bergman">So I have gone over my time and, unless there are any other 
follow-ups, we are going to proceed here with a closing 
statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Bergman">First of all, I would like to thank all of the witnesses 
for participating in the hearing today. The panel is now 
excused.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Bergman">And as you heard Chairman Bost and Ranking Members Kuster 
and Esty say, you know, that our efforts as these Subcommittees 
on behalf of the veterans are an example of true bipartisan 
effort that we are all philosophically aligned that it is our 
job as the Committee to do the right thing for the veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Bergman">These Subcommittees that we represent here will continue to 
set the example for our 115th Congress about doing the right 
thing for those involved. So I am very proud to be a Member of 
this Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Bergman">For years this Committee has been working to address the 
root cause of the high denial rate for Gulf War Illness claims. 
In that time, we have been met with a list of excuses from VA 
for failing to improve the process for Gulf War claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Last year, we held a hearing to assess the disability 
claims process for Gulf War veterans and highlighted, just as 
we have discussed here today, that VA's approval rate for Gulf 
War Illness claims is less than 20 percent. VA often seems to 
deny these claims because it demands to know the specific cause 
of an illness, yet under the law presumptive conditions do not 
require causality, because they are presumed to have been 
caused by service in the Gulf War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The Government Accountability Office report that we have 
discussed in detail here today further substantiated that the 
approval rates for Gulf War Illness claims are three times 
lower than all other claimed disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The critical point to understand is that veterans cannot 
receive appropriate VA care for symptoms of Gulf War Illness 
when the majority of those claims have been denied by the VA. 
To make matters worse, the reason for claims denials are also 
not clearly communicated to veterans, we heard that in your 
testimony--it is not written in English, if you will--or their 
representatives. Failure to communicate the reason for denials 
often leaves veterans with confusing or insufficient 
information for a potential appeal, which further delays access 
to care and compensation for injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Bergman">GAO's review of the medical examination process for Gulf 
War Illness also highlighted that VA's medical staff are not 
adequately trained to conduct the exam. And we talked about the 
90-minute optional course here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Bergman">VHA medical examiners informed GAO that it is challenging 
to conduct Gulf War general medical exams due to the range of 
symptoms associated with the claims. Although their concerns 
are legitimate, there is limited evidence to support that VHA 
has taken the initiative to improve the examination process. 
Again, that sense of urgency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Bergman">GAO reported that, as of February 2017, only ten percent of 
examiners participated in the optional online training for 
those examiners. This statistic is troubling, very troubling, 
because the VBA cannot consistently and accurately provide 
benefits ratings without a proper exam from VHA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Furthermore, GAO found that another contributing factor for 
claims denial was the lack of a single case definition of Gulf 
War Illness. Establishing such a definition could lead to 
improvement in diagnosis and treatment of Gulf War Illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Over the years, Congress has appropriated millions of 
dollars for VA research programs and there is still strong 
resistance against establishing a single case definition for 
undiagnosed illness related to Gulf War service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Bergman">I am also extremely concerned that VA does not have a plan 
to guide, to review of the existing medical data sets and 
integrated information from recent and ongoing research to 
identify areas of future research and establish a single case 
definition. Again, that sense of urgency when it comes to 
innovating and really coming together to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Bergman">I look forward to continuing to work with VA, Veterans 
Service Organizations, and other stakeholders to increase Gulf 
War Illness claims approval rates. Improve the medical 
examination process, prioritize research related to Gulf War 
Illness, and ensure the VBA is providing straightforward 
information to veterans regarding their benefits decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Bergman">    With that, I now yield to Ranking Member Esty for any 
closing remarks that you might have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Esty</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Esty">Thank you, General, and thank you to all of you
on the panel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Ms. Esty">And I particularly want to thank Mr. Hardie. I know this 
has been a passion of yours, and you have been a forceful and 
persistent and, sadly, necessary advocate to put a human face 
on what I know from my friend Mike Siccea, who has inspired me 
to introduce a burn pits bill to try to move this along 
further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Ms. Esty">So I in particular want to thank you for your advocacy and 
I don't think we would be here today if it were not for your 
efforts. And I am sorry for the reasons that it has brought you 
here, but I am glad that you are here and I want to thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Ms. Esty">As a newer Member of this Committee, I am struck by how 
much we need to learn the hard-earned lessons of Agent Orange 
and not do what was done then. And I think the level of 
frustration you are seeing from this panel is a deja vu that 
this is taking too long and not everybody has got time, nor 
should they have to wait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Ms. Esty">The most important of those lessons is that we have to be 
determined, we have to work together. The unwieldy and long 
research process, which again I would agree with my colleague 
Representative Brownley, the expert on Gulf War Illness, with 
all due respect, is not the National Academy of Sciences, it 
should be the VA. Nobody else actually should know--or DoD or 
working together--nobody else is actually going to know that 
other than, right here, the people who supervise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Ms. Esty">The difficulty medical examiners have understanding the 
multi-symptom health conditions of Gulf War, and these are 
getting in the way of identifying and quantifying toxic 
exposures on the front end, and providing timely, fair 
compensation, services, and most importantly top-quality health 
care for our Gulf War veterans on the back end. We owe it to 
them not to let this happen, as we continue to owe it to our 
Vietnam veterans and the Blue Water veterans who are still 
trying to find a way to get the care that they need and 
deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Ms. Esty">I think it is very clear, and I want to acknowledge and 
thank the VA for taking steps in a positive direction for 
veterans who have Gulf War Illness, but it seems to me these 
steps are too small; they are too incremental, they lack the 
urgency, and they lack the surge, the surge that we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Ms. Esty">It has been 26 years since the first Gulf War started. Many 
of the veterans who were deployed are very sick and they have 
been beaten down by a claims process that is confusing, it is 
unclear, and in almost every case it seems to deny what they 
know to be true in their lives. That has undermined their faith 
in the system as a whole, and they have disconnected and they 
are discouraged, and that is, quite simply, wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Ms. Esty">So I want to say for my part, and I suspect I am not the 
only one on this panel, that if VA doesn't use its authority on 
its own initiative, Congress will begin to take steps. We will 
set timeframes, we will mandate training for all examiners, 
whether they are in the VA or whether they are contract. I 
think that has to happen. We will mandate timelines within 
which we have to have a single definition that everybody can 
use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Ms. Esty">And most importantly, we need to do better. The General and 
I were talking about this point about cost, which often seems 
to me to be really the reason behind the red tape. The point 
should be to care for our veterans and if we are spend so darn 
much time and expense and people dedicated to making people who 
are sick prove just how sick they are and how they got so sick, 
what about just taking care of the people who defended this 
country. What if we took those same resources that are deployed 
now on saying no and deployed them to saying yes to those who 
were deployed in the Gulf?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Ms. Esty">And I think it is not just an academic exercise to answer 
the question that the General and I were talking about and he 
directly asked you, what would be the cost of truly, 
presumptively saying anyone who served, if you got any of this, 
we are going to get you better and back on your feet. That is 
our commitment to you. And not spend our time trying to 
determine what percentage, where were you exactly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Ms. Esty">The point is people served and they need help now. And we 
should be able to expect, and they should too, that they can 
get back on their feet and be productive members of society. We 
shouldn't ask them to prove how disabled they are, we should be 
helping them to get as abled as they could be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Ms. Esty">And I think that is a really serious thing we all need to 
be thinking about, because I am new to this Committee, but I am 
not new to hearing from the veterans in my district and the 
frustration that they feel, and the time and effort that goes 
into these fine hair distinctions, when instead I would rather 
see that money going to care for our veterans and get them back 
on their feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Ms. Esty">So I would ask you all to think seriously about that and 
ask everyone on this panel if the time hasn't come to rethink, 
particularly when we are now at a point with a voluntary force. 
Our veterans are changing and we need to think about changing 
with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. Esty">Thank you for your service, thank you for working with us. 
And we look forward to seeing those letters in August and I 
hope they will be shared with the VSOs, so we can get this 
better and get this right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Ms. Esty">    Thank you very much and, with that, Mr. Chairman, General, 
I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Thanks, Ranking Member Esty.</paragraph>

Opening Remarks</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Chairman Bost, Chairman Bergman, Ranking Members Esty and Kuster, 
and Members of the Subcommittees, thank you for the opportunity to 
discuss how the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) processes Gulf War 
Veterans' disability compensation claims for undiagnosed illnesses or 
medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illnesses. With me today is 
Dr. Patrick Joyce, Chief, Occupational Health Clinics, Washington VAMC, 
VHA. My testimony will provide an overview of VA's processing of these 
claims and our training and quality assurance efforts.
Gulf War Illnesses</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Service connection for undiagnosed illnesses or medically 
unexplained chronic multi-symptom illnesses requires service in the 
Persian Gulf after August 2, 1990, and a qualifying chronic disability 
that rises to a compensable level of severity before December 31, 2021. 
To ensure Veterans who served in the Southwest Asia theater of 
operations continue to be entitled to benefits under the law, VA 
recently updated the regulation in 38 Code of Federal Regulations Sec.  
3.317 to extend the date for which service connection may be awarded 
for a qualifying Gulf War illness from December 31, 2016, to December 
31, 2021.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Bergman">A medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness means a 
diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology. The 
objective signs and symptoms of these disabilities, as well as 
undiagnosed illnesses, include fatigue, skin conditions, headaches, 
muscle pain, joint pain, sleep disturbances, and cardiovascular 
symptoms, among others. The term ``medically unexplained chronic multi-
symptom illness'' also covers diagnosed illness defined by a cluster of 
signs or symptoms, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and 
functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural 
gastrointestinal diseases).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Processing these types of claims requires a careful review of 
service treatment records, military personnel records, and post-service 
treatment records. Claims processors must carefully review the claimed 
disabilities and symptoms. Medical examinations are generally required 
where VA identifies these disability patterns to determine whether 
there is a medical explanation of the disabilities.
Gulf War Claims Processing</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Bergman">In fiscal year (FY) 2016, approximately 18,681 Veterans who served 
in the Southwest Asia theater of operations received a rating decision 
for a claim for service connection for undiagnosed illnesses or chronic 
multi-symptom illnesses. From this number, 4,594 Veterans were awarded 
service connection for one or more undiagnosed illness or chronic 
medically unexplained multi-symptom illness. This equates to a grant 
(or approval) rate of 25 percent. When considering each type of claim, 
the approval rate for a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom 
illness is 31 percent compared to 13 percent for an undiagnosed 
illness. It should be noted that when a Veteran claims an undiagnosed 
illness, if upon examination or if the medical evidence shows that 
symptoms can be attributed to a diagnosed condition, VA will service 
connect the diagnosed condition whenever possible rather than 
characterizing the claimed condition as undiagnosed. Therefore, the 
number of grants for undiagnosed illnesses or chronic multi-symptom 
illnesses do not reflect the actual number of Veterans service 
connected for known disabilities resulting from their Gulf War service.
Training</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Bergman">VBA has developed a total of thirteen courses for claims processors 
that are focused on processing of claims for undiagnosed illnesses or 
chronic multi-symptom illnesses. Over the last year, VA Central Office 
mandated, as part of the FY 2017 National Training Curriculum for 
Rating Veterans Service Representatives, required training of four 
interactive lessons (eight hours) and one classroom-based course (two 
hours) for a total of 10 hours of training. For Veterans Service 
Representatives, a two-hour required class was mandated as part of the 
National Training Curriculum. In addition, a new lesson titled, 
``Southwest Asia/Gulf War Claims Development'' is currently being 
developed and is scheduled to launch in FY 2018.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Bergman">VA has implemented a number of other initiatives to improve Gulf 
War claims processing. VBA is making necessary changes to improve the 
notification process, specifically to require that decision letters 
indicate that claimed issues were evaluated under both presumptive and 
direct service-connection methods. This change is scheduled to go into 
effect by the end of August 2017. VA has developed special tracking to 
specifically account for Gulf War claims. VA has also amended its Gulf 
War General Medical Examination template to include information for 
examiners on undiagnosed and chronic multi-symptom illnesses, as well 
as information on environmental exposures in the Gulf War.
Quality</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is constantly looking 
for ways to improve the service it provides to America's Veterans, 
including this cohort of Veterans. VBA works with the Veterans Health 
Administration (VHA) in reviewing the research done by its Offices of 
Public Health and Research and Development, as well as the National 
Academy of Medicine's (formerly the Institute of Medicine) biennial 
update on Gulf War issues. VBA also works with VHA and the Department 
of Defense in joint workgroups that research occupational and 
environmental hazards coincident with military service. VBA 
collaborates with VHA to update training for its medical examiners, as 
well as VBA's contract medical examiners. Finally, VA continues to 
collaborate with the National Gulf War Resource Center (NGWRC) in 
bimonthly meetings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Bergman">VBA has a national quality review staff, as well as quality 
reviewers in its local regional offices, to ensure employees correctly 
process and decide claims for Gulf War illness. As agreed upon with 
NGWRC, VA conducted two distinct special-focused reviews of decisions 
on claims for Gulf War-related illnesses in December 2015 and September 
2016. The review in December 2015 focused on FY 2015 Gulf War illness 
cases and showed a 94-percent accuracy rate. The September 2016 review 
expanded the review to cases that involved claims for medically 
unexplained chronic multi-symptom illnesses over a 4-year period 
starting from FY 2011. This review showed an 89-percent accuracy rate.
Closing Remarks</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Bergman">VA continues to improve the efficient, timely, and accurate 
processing of disability compensation claims involving service in the 
Gulf War. Although the science and medical aspects of undiagnosed 
illnesses and multi-symptom illnesses are complex, VA continues to 
review scientific evidence and medical literature to gain a better 
understanding of the impact of these illnesses on our Gulf War 
Veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Bergman">This concludes my testimony. I am pleased to address any questions 
you or other Members of the Subcommittees may have.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Chairmen Bergman and Bost, Ranking Members Kuster and Esty, and 
Members of the Subcommittees:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Bergman">I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent report on the 
process the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses to evaluate Gulf 
War Illness disability compensation claims. VA estimates that among the 
nearly 700,000 veterans who served in the Persian Gulf War in 1990-
1991, about 44 percent experience chronic medical issues commonly 
referred to as Gulf War Illness. There are no similar VA estimates of 
the prevalence of Gulf War Illness among veterans who were deployed to 
the region after 1991. According to the Department of Defense, however, 
these veterans may have also been exposed to certain environmental 
hazards and many have developed similar medical issues upon their 
return. The exact causes of Gulf War Illness are not always known and 
veterans' symptoms vary widely, but include fatigue, headaches, joint 
pain, indigestion, insomnia, respiratory disorders, skin problems, and 
memory impairment, among others. VA refers to claims for Gulf War 
Illness as ``undiagnosed illness,'' ``medically unexplained chronic 
multisymptom illness,'' and ``infectious disease'' claims. For the 
purposes of this testimony, we collectively refer to these three types 
of claims as Gulf War Illness claims (see fig. 1).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Note: The symptoms of undiagnosed illness and the chronic 
multisymptom illnesses are examples-not an exhaustive list-of medical 
issues that VA associates with Gulf War Illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Bergman">(a) The symptoms listed below may be manifestations of either 
undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multisymptom 
illness. For simplicity, these symptoms are listed only once, under the 
category of undiagnosed illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Bergman">(b) Irritable bowel syndrome is one common type of functional 
gastrointestinal disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The VA provides disability compensation benefits to veterans with 
disabling conditions that were incurred or aggravated during active 
military service. \1\ Gulf War Illness claims are different in that VA 
can award benefits to certain veterans who served in a Gulf War 
conflict since 1990 and display any of the symptoms listed above 
without the veteran having to prove the symptoms are related to their 
military service. VA does require proof, however, of a veteran's 
service in the Gulf War region and existence of the claimed symptoms. 
Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) claims raters review each claim 
to determine if relevant criteria are met, including verifying the 
veteran's deployment location; establishing whether the veteran's 
symptoms have lasted for a minimum of 6 months; and assessing the 
severity of the veteran's condition. \2\ As such, the VBA may request a 
medical examination from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to 
obtain additional information about the veteran's disability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\1\ See 38 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1110 and 1131. This does not include 
disabilities incurred by a veteran's own willful misconduct or abuse of 
alcohol or drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\2\ The minimum 6 month time period does not apply to claims for 
certain infectious diseases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Bergman">From fiscal years 1994 through 2016, VA has funded more than $170 
million for Gulf War Illness-related medical research, including $12.3 
million in fiscal year 2016. According to the VA and a 2016 National 
Academy of Medicine report, while much progress has been made in Gulf 
War Illness research, more work is needed to better understand what 
Gulf War Illness is and how to treat it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Bergman">My remarks today are based on our recent report, entitled Gulf War 
Illness: Improvements Needed for VA to Better Understand, Process, and 
Communicate Decisions on Claims. \3\ Accordingly, this testimony 
addresses (1) recent trends in Gulf War Illness disability claims, (2) 
challenges VA faces with accurately processing and clearly 
communicating decisions on Gulf War Illness claims, and (3) how VA uses 
Gulf War Illness research to inform its disability compensation 
program. In addition, I will highlight several key actions that we 
recommended in our report that VA can take to help address challenges 
with its Gulf War Illness disability claims process.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Bergman">For our report, we analyzed VBA data on disability compensation 
claims completed during fiscal years 2010 through 2015 and reviewed a 
non-generalizable sample of 44 Gulf War Illness claims that were 
completed in fiscal year 2015. \4\ We also visited 4 of VBA's 58 
regional offices (selected for high numbers of Gulf War Illness claims 
completed in fiscal year 2015 and geographic dispersion) and nearby VHA 
health care facilities where medical examinations take place. \5\ 
Throughout our work, we interviewed staff from VA headquarters and the 
4 regional offices we visited, as well as representatives from several 
veterans advocacy groups. We also reviewed relevant federal laws and 
regulations related to disability compensation benefits for Gulf War 
Illness. Additional information on our scope and methodology is 
available in our full report. We conducted the work on which this 
testimony is based in accordance with generally accepted government 
auditing standards.

    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\4\ We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for the

In Recent Years, Completed Gulf War Illness Claims Have Risen, Included</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Bergman">More Medical Issues, and Been Approved at Lower Rates Than Other 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Service-related Disabilities</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Bergman">According to our analysis of VBA data, the number of Gulf War 
Illness claims has substantially increased in recent years and these 
claims often include multiple medical issues, which generally require 
more time to process. Specifically, in fiscal year 2015, VBA completed 
about 11,400 Gulf War Illness claims, which was more than double the 
4,800 claims for Gulf War Illness it completed in fiscal year 2010. \6\ 
Many of these claims included multiple medical issues-or, symptoms-
related to Gulf War Illness. \7\ On average, we found that Gulf War 
Illness claims had about twice as many medical issues per claim as 
other disability claims, and took 4 months longer to complete.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\6\ VBA completed processing over 42,000 Gulf War Illness claims 
during the 6 year time period we reviewed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\7\ A medical issue is an illness or condition that a veteran 
alleges was caused or worsened by their military service and may 
entitle the veteran to disability benefits. A veteran may file multiple 
claims with VA, and each claim may include multiple medical issues.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Bergman">We also found that Gulf War Illness claims were approved at lower 
rates than other types of disability claims. During fiscal years 2010 
through 2015, we found that approval rates for Gulf War Illness medical 
issues were about three times lower than for all other claimed 
disabilities-17 percent of Gulf War Illness medical issues were 
approved over the 6-year time period we reviewed in comparison to 57 
percent of all other types of medical issues. \8\ According to VA, 
several factors may contribute to lower approval rates for Gulf War 
Illness medical issues including that these claims are not always well 
understood by VA staff. Additionally, according to some VA staff we 
spoke with, veterans sometimes file for Gulf War Illness disability 
benefits but do not provide sufficient evidence that their symptoms 
have existed for at least 6 months, as generally required by VA 
regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\8\ VBA makes a separate determination on each medical issue 
submitted by the veteran and, therefore, we analyzed approval rates for 
Gulf War Illness claims at the medical issue level.
Accurate Processing of Gulf War Illness Claims Is Hampered by Confusion</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Bergman">about the Gulf War General Medical Exam, and Claim Decision Letters 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Lack Key Information</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Bergman">VBA has clarified its guidance and implemented additional training 
for its claims rating staff, but the agency's ability to accurately 
process Gulf War Illness claims is hampered by inadequate training for 
VHA medical examiners who conduct medical examinations. VBA claims 
rating staff often rely on medical examiners to assess a veteran's 
disability before they make a decision on a claim. Medical examiners we 
interviewed said that conducting Gulf War general medical exams is 
challenging because of the range of symptoms that could qualify as Gulf 
War Illness. The VHA has offered an elective 90 minute web-based Gulf 
War Illness training for its medical examiners since June 2015. 
According to a VHA official, as of February 2017, VHA training data 
show only 10 percent of examiners had taken this training. Federal 
internal control standards call for adequate training for staff so that 
they can correctly carry out an agency's procedures. Medical examiners 
who do not take this Gulf War Illness-specific training may not be able 
to provide information to VBA staff to correctly decide whether to 
grant or deny a veteran's claim. To help ensure that medical examiners 
are well prepared to conduct Gulf War Illness medical examinations, we 
recommended that VA require its medical examiners to complete training, 
such as the 90-minute web-based course developed by VHA, prior to 
conducting Gulf War Illness medical examinations. VA agreed with this 
recommendation and plans to require that all its medical examiners take 
the 90-minute training course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Bergman">We also found that decision letters VA sends to veterans denying 
benefits for Gulf War Illness claims do not always clearly explain to 
the veteran how their Gulf War Illness claim was decided, which can 
leave a veteran uncertain about how the claim was evaluated and 
potentially lead to unnecessary appeals. VA regulations require that a 
clear statement be provided to the veteran regarding the agency's 
decision on each claim. \9\ Without VBA including clear language in its 
decision letters, veterans may be unable to make a fully informed 
decision on whether to appeal VBA's decision. To improve communication 
with and provide more complete information to veterans whose Gulf War 
Illness claims are denied, we recommended that VA require decision 
letters for Gulf War Illness claims to clearly explain how the claim 
was evaluated. VA agreed with our recommendation and is in the process 
of updating its guidance to the regional offices to clarify the 
language required for its Gulf War Illness decision letters.

disability compensation purposes, but it does not have a plan to 
develop a uniformly used case definition of Gulf War Illness. Based on 
research evidence, in 2010, VA added nine infectious diseases to the 
list of recognized Gulf War Illness-related conditions in its 
regulations. \10\ Since then, VA has not identified any new conditions 
that it associates with Gulf War service, but agency officials say that 
they continue to explore whether additional conditions should be added.

    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\10\ Presumptions of Service Connection for Persian Gulf Service, 
75 Fed. Reg. 59,968 (Sept. 29, 2010). In 1998, legislation was enacted 
that required VA to seek to enter into an agreement with the National 
Academy of Sciences to study Gulf War Illness related topics. See Pub. 
L. No. 105-277, Sec.  1603, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-745 (1998). VA relied 
on findings from one of these studies when determining that it should 
provide disability compensation to Gulf War veterans who have these 
nine infectious diseases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Despite the progress made by VA's Gulf War Illness research 
program, VA advisory groups have noted the lack of a single case 
definition that can be uniformly used to study Gulf War Illness, and 
emphasized that establishing a single definition could further improve 
the research, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of veterans with Gulf 
War Illness. VA's advisory groups recommended that in the near-term, 
the agency analyze data from its existing datasets to better understand 
how they can be used to contribute to a single case definition. For 
example, VA has access to dozens of existing large-population datasets 
from federally-sponsored research studies and data contained in several 
federal Gulf War registries that include veterans' health information. 
According to VA, if these data were merged with its administrative 
datasets (for example, those containing clinical and benefits data), 
the information could be leveraged by VA researchers to improve 
understanding of Gulf War Illness and, ultimately, contribute to the 
development of a single case definition. Merging these datasets could 
provide researchers with additional information needed to develop a 
case definition, including information on veterans' service and onset 
of their symptoms. In addition, VA's research advisory groups also 
noted the need for VA to plan for future research that is likely to 
contribute to a single case definition in the long-term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Bergman">VA included in its 2015 Gulf War Research Strategic Plan a 
strategic objective to establish a single case definition, but 
according to a VA official, the agency has no action plan in place to 
achieve it. Federal internal control standards call for agencies to 
have documented plans that include specific action steps associated 
with their objectives. VHA officials told us that they are considering 
how to use existing federal datasets and ongoing research to better 
understand Gulf War Illness but have not laid out specific actions, 
such as what data to use and how using these data would contribute to 
the development of a single case definition. VA officials attributed 
the lack of a specific plan to challenges with developing a single case 
definition and noted that it must be a slow and deliberate process. 
However, without a plan, VA risks engaging in research activities that 
are not cohesively targeted toward its goal of establishing a single 
case definition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Bergman">To increase the likelihood of making progress toward developing a 
single case definition of Gulf War Illness, we recommended that VA 
prepare and document a plan to develop such a definition, including 
near- and long-term goals and specific actions needed to meet those 
goals. In response, VA agreed with this recommendation and will convene 
a group of subject matter experts to work on a plan.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Prepared Statement of Zachary Hearn</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Bergman">In March 2016, The American Legion testified before a joint hearing 
of the Subcommittees on Oversight and Investigation, and Disability 
Assistance and Memorial Affairs to discuss the adjudication of Gulf War 
Illness claims for veterans that served in the Persian Gulf since 
August 2, 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Bergman">These veterans are prideful based on their honorable service, but 
many remain frustrated due to their chronic and unexplained illnesses. 
They defeated an aggressor, liberated a nation, and defended American 
interests, but for some the cost of this service to our nation has 
resulted in many veterans suffering with debilitating symptoms since 
returning from the Persian Gulf. The specific etiology of the 
conditions are mysterious, and the granting of presumptive claims 
related to Persian Gulf service remains a painfully long process that 
could result in years of appeals before receiving the positive 
adjudication they have earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Chairmen Bergman, Bost, Ranking Members Kuster, Esty, and 
distinguished members of the Subcommittees on Oversight and 
Investigations, and Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs; on 
behalf of National Commander Charles E. Schmidt and The American 
Legion, the country's largest patriotic wartime service organization 
for veterans, comprising over 2 million members and serving every man 
and woman who has worn the uniform for this country; thank you for the 
opportunity to testify regarding The American Legion's position on 
"Examining VA's Processing of Gulf War Illness Claims".</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Background</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) currently identifies 
numerous medical conditions or symptoms that are presumptively related 
to Gulf War service. Presumptively awarding service connection for 
conditions due to environmental exposures is not a new concept for VA. 
Conditions such as diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and a variety of 
cancers are presumptively related to herbicide exposure in Vietnam. 
Additionally, veterans of radiation testing have had multiple 
conditions presumptively ascribed to radiation exposure in service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Bergman">For Persian Gulf veterans, they face a unique set of challenges in 
their quest to gain benefits derived from their military service. 
Unlike herbicide and radiation exposed veterans, many Persian Gulf 
veterans must prove they suffer from symptoms, or clusters of symptoms, 
and endure years of medical tests to indicate that they suffer from an 
undiagnosed illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Bergman">"Undiagnosed illness" is a frustrating explanation to a complicated 
medical situation. Numerous medical studies have revealed that veterans 
who returned from Persian Gulf service face serious health concerns 
following their deployments. However, a generation removed from 
Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the medical community is 
still uncertain of how to properly diagnose or treat these veterans 
resulting in VA routinely denying disability compensation to veterans 
seeking service connection for Gulf War related conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Due to the ambiguity in the application of presumptive conditions 
associated with Persian Gulf service and the uncertainty within the 
medical community, veterans have become increasingly frustrated while 
trying to get their claims properly adjudicated. A common problem The 
American Legion finds is that veterans who seek a claim for benefits; 
and because of the complexity of Gulf War Illness (GWI); find that the 
diagnosis may have changed multiple times. VA raters are not medical 
specialists and are often unaware and unable to detect that the rapidly 
changing diagnosis is essentially the same condition. Moreover, the 
situation is further complicated by the fact that if one medical 
professional renders a diagnosis, by definition it is no longer an 
undiagnosed illness; even if the veteran received a multitude of 
differing diagnoses related to the same symptoms; and is therefore no 
longer undiagnosed according to VA raters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The American Legion has over 3,000 accredited representatives 
located throughout the nation. Through their dedicated efforts, The 
American Legion represented over 800,000 veterans in Fiscal Year 2016. 
We are fortunate to have trained professional service officers in each 
of VA's 56 regional offices (VAROs) and were able to refer to our 
national network of service office in March 2016, while testifying 
about Gulf War Illness claims. Some of the veterans' experienced the 
following road blocks while seeking service connection ratings:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  Medical professionals hesitate to connect conditions to 
Persian Gulf service;</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  Some veterans have elected not to pursue benefits because 
a perception exists that there is more desire to service connect 
veterans with service in Vietnam;</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  Medical professionals will assign symptoms to aging; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  Medical professionals suggest the veteran is malingering, 
stating they are too young for the symptoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Bergman">According to American Legion's Department Service Officers (DSOs), 
little if anything has changed regarding the development and 
adjudication of claims in more than a year since the March 2016 
hearing. Many DSOs report limited GWI research combined with 
adjudicators' denial of claims have led to many appeals that result in 
years of waiting and increased anguish for veterans and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The American Legion's concerns were confirmed in the recently 
released Government Accountability Office (GAO) report \1\. GAO concurs 
with years of complaints from veterans and veterans service 
organizations (VSOs) regarding the treatment, development, and 
adjudication of Gulf War Illness claims. GAO's report provides insight 
into VA's lack of providing training to medical staff and VARO 
employees. VA's lack of training has resulted in various 
interpretations of guidance provided by VA Central Office resulting in 
vastly different outcomes for veterans. Furthermore, GAO concludes that 
VA's lack of clarity in its decision letters pertaining to Gulf War 
Illness claims leads to more questions than answers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\1\ Gulf War Illness: Improvements Needed for VA to Better 
Understand, Process, and Communicate Decisions on Claims, GAO, June 
2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Many DSOs and veterans have discovered they may fare better if 
they ultimately appeal Gulf War related conditions to the Board of 
Veterans' Appeals (BVA). One DSO stated that he encourages veterans to 
submit lay statements from friends and family members detailing the 
symptoms the veteran has experienced to bolster the claim. He also 
states that a VA rater will likely ignore the lay statement that may 
detail the chronic symptoms; however, BVA veterans' law judges will 
take the lay statements into consideration when rendering a decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Each year The American Legion visits VAROs to review recently 
adjudicated claims and meet with VA employees. It is not uncommon to 
hear VA employees tell us that BVA has greater latitude than VA raters 
in adjudicating claims. It was concerning when we heard these 
statements from raters and decision review officers (DROs), and it was 
alarming when we heard it from a veterans' service center manager, and 
it was stunning when we heard last year from a senior official within 
the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) that the BVA has greater 
authority. When asked to clarify the statement and cite a regulation or 
statute, the official simply stated, "They just do", when in fact - 
they do NOT. The VA and the Board both adjudicate from the same 
statute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Based on this common misconception The American Legion contacted 
VA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) for input. OGC agrees with The 
American Legion that no greater authority is given to a BVA judge than 
a VA rater or DRO adding, "It is not accurate to say that the Board has 
greater authority than the (VARO) to grant benefits, or any authority 
at all to circumvent the law and award benefits at will." In short, a 
rater has the ability to grant the same claim as the BVA judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Bergman">VBA has routinely stated that BVA's combined 75 percent grant and 
remand rate for all appeals is due largely to the submission of 
additional evidence or the passage of time. There is some truth to that 
statement - however when considering that at least one senior official 
at VA Central Office stated that the BVA has greater authority, and 
numerous individuals at VAROs employed in management, as well as front 
line employee concur with that belief - VBA must own its routine 
inadequate development and premature denial of claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Bergman">OGC's response to why the perception may exist that BVA has greater 
latitude sheds light on one of the issues that hamper VBA - its own 
manual. According to OGC, "One provision that may further misconception 
is 38 C.F.R. Sec.  19.5 which provides that the Board is not bound by 
Department manuals, circulars, or similar administrative issues." VBA's 
manual was designed to provide "procedures for the adjudication of 
claims for compensation, pension, dependency and indemnity 
compensation, accrued benefits and burial allowance." \2\ Considering 
the routinely different outcomes between VBA and BVA decisions, it 
stands to reason that VBA needs to reconsider the manual and its use of 
the document.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\2\ VBA M21-1 Adjudication Procedures
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The use of lay statements in VBA decisions by VBA raters has become 
far less common. One reason for this is VA's implementation of its 
"Evaluation Builder" within the Veterans Benefits Management System. 
The Evaluation Builder tool was designed to provide uniform outcomes in 
decisions regardless of adjudicator. Discussions with line employees 
and VARO management at numerous offices have concluded that lay 
statements cannot be taken into account within the tool. This is 
further complicated by the fact that if a rater overrides the suggested 
decision, the quality review team (QRT) is notified and a review of the 
decision is initiated by QRT. Many employees report they will 
adjudicate in accordance with the Evaluation Builder tool's suggestion 
in order to avoid a QRT review. This lack of use of lay statements 
omits significant evidence, severely disadvantages veterans who submit 
this evidence, and causes significant harm to veterans who are denied 
benefits because raters refuse to consider all legal evidence. As an 
example, statements that support a continuity of symptoms could be 
evidence toward receiving a grant of benefits, or photographs would 
support the existence of an undocumented temporary duty assignment that 
wasn't properly documented in the veteran's official military record. 
It is absolutely critical that all levels of the VBA adjudication 
process fully support the use of lay statements, and The American 
Legion calls on VA to immediately cease the practice of largely 
ignoring this type of important legal evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The American Legion finds that training continues to be an issue at 
VBA. One of our DSOs tells us that according to a VARO employee "VBA 
employees receive less (GWI) training than (VSOs)." The employee 
further states that any training received has been through VA's Talent 
Management System (TMS) web-based training, and that TMS training is 
not typically treated with the same level of focus as classroom 
training which has led to frustration with GWI claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Bergman">DSOs also question the level of training that medical providers are 
receiving regarding Gulf War Illness claims and question if minimal, or 
if any training at all is being provided. VBA's expansion of contract 
compensation and pension exams is also raising concerns. Contractors 
may be hired with little to no training regarding GWI which will result 
in negative nexus statements and an ultimate denial by VBA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The American Legion understands and appreciates the challenges VA 
faces regarding GWI. Unlike Agent Orange related claims or radiation 
exposure claims, a decision has to be rendered on an undiagnosed 
illness creating an inherent ambiguity. The American Legion suggested 
changes to Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) in March 2016 
which have not been adopted. DBQs are a standardized form used by 
medical providers to evaluate the level of disabilities suffered by 
veterans; both VA and private sector medical professionals have the 
ability to access these forms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Bergman">As previously stated, many veterans are denied compensation 
benefits for Persian Gulf related conditions upon receiving a 
diagnosis, even if the diagnosis changes over the course of months or 
years. This lack of access to benefits can result in unequal and 
extraordinary hardship to veterans and their family members - all while 
their health continues to deteriorate. The American Legion calls on VA 
to identify veterans with Persian Gulf service and allow medical 
professionals to opine on DBQs if the sought medical conditions could 
at least as likely as not be related to Persian Gulf service despite 
having a diagnosis. This would provide the necessary path for medical 
providers, VA, and most importantly, our veterans, to finally receive 
their VA disability compensation. Through this additional language 
examiners and VA would have the necessary latitude to provide proper 
benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The American Legion calls on this Committee to have ongoing 
roundtables regarding GWI between Congress, VA, and VSOs so that we can 
improve the delivery of benefits for those suffering GWI. The appeals 
modernization effort that began in 2016 is proof that when we 
collaborate on a common problem, we can arrive at a successful 
solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The American Legion has been concerned about the effects of 
environmental exposure on our servicemembers, and the resulting health 
effects years following service for more than 20 years. During The 
American Legion's 98th National Convention, we called upon "the 
scientific community to focus its efforts on the most likely causes of 
Gulf War veterans' illnesses" and for VA to "closely monitor the 
implementation of changes to title 38, United States Code, section 
1117, to ensure proper application of the law at the Department of 
Veterans Affairs regional office(s)", through passage of American 
Legion Resolution 122. \3\ Additionally, the resolution states The 
American Legion supports a "liberalization of the rules relating to the 
evaluation of studies involving exposure to any environmental hazard 
and that all necessary action be taken by the federal government, both 
administratively and legislatively as appropriate, to ensure that 
veterans are properly compensated for diseases and other disabilities 
scientifically associated with a particular exposure."

    <paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Conclusion:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The American Legion appreciates the level of difficulty associated 
with claims pertaining to Persian Gulf service; however, veterans have 
now suffered for a quarter of a century. VA's continuous reliance on 
the medical community to discover the etiology for a syndrome they have 
yet to define has cost too many veterans years of disability 
compensation. We call for an immediate liberalization in the way Gulf 
War claims are adjudicated so as to provide an opportunity for our Gulf 
War veterans to finally receive the benefits they have earned through 
their honorable service. The American Legion thanks this committee for 
their diligence and commitment to our nation's veterans on this topic.

    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Prepared Statement of Michael Figlioli</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Chairmen Bost and Bergman, Ranking Members Esty and Kuster and 
members of the Subcommittees, on behalf of the men and women of the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) and its Auxiliary, 
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to testify on the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability claims process with 
respect to Gulf War Illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Bergman">As professionally trained, accredited advocates, VFW service 
officers work extraordinarily hard to ensure our veterans and their 
families receive the maximum benefit allowable by law from the VA. All 
too often, however, this does not happen for a myriad of reasons and 
contributing factors. In relation to the topic of today's hearing, I 
refer to a signature condition of the Persian Gulf War referred to 
largely across the veterans' community as Gulf War Illness (GWI) or 
more commonly in VA, as ``Medically Unexplained Chronic Multisymptom 
Illness.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Unlike nearly all other claimed conditions, Gulf War Illness is 
intrinsically difficult to diagnose and treat. GWI has no clear and 
concise set of rules. In other words, no one distinctive set of 
symptoms that allow for a single, unmistakable diagnosis. Gulf War 
Illness presents itself as a conglomeration of possible symptoms to 
which countless members of the general public with no military 
experience can also be subject. As such, Persian Gulf veterans have a 
steeper hill to climb in relating the symptoms to service--the most 
critical link in establishing service- connection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Bergman">None of this is remotely possible without the benefit of a VA 
examination (VAE), either at a VA medical facility or with a VA 
contracted provider. As VA continues to evolve on a number of fronts, 
mostly with regard to the transition to electronic filing and continued 
concentration on managing the current claims inventory, VA developed 
the Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) with an eye towards 
efficiency and timeliness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Last year, the VFW strongly advocated for the elimination of the 
parsing out of symptoms and placing greater concentration on the 
clustering of these indicators of potentially one illness affecting 
multiple body symptoms, as opposed to specific conditions related to 
each symptom. Put more simply, the VFW feels GWI claimants would be 
better served by VA eliminating the assignment of multiple DBQs for 
seemingly unrelated symptoms upon the receipt of a diagnosis, and posit 
from the outset that the evidence meets the criteria for Gulf War 
Illness, as opposed to its current form of considering the possibility 
as a last resort. It was and remains our contention that the current 
system of assigning separate DBQs for each symptom being claimed in 
association with GWI promotes the potential for incorrectly assigning a 
diagnosis to a condition linked to GWI. Thus, either improperly or 
inadvertently negating the requirements of section 3.317 of title 38, 
Code of Federal Regulation (CFR), which ultimately results in the 
veteran's claim being denied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Regrettably, in the 479 days since these distinguished committees 
last met to discuss this topic and pressed VA to develop a single DBQ 
for GWI that would assist in empirically establishing service-
connection, VA's Office of Disability Assistance, has not reported any 
progress in the development of a single Gulf War Illness DBQ as 
Congress suggested, and veterans suffering from these chronic 
conditions that may give the appearance of a confirmed etiology 
continue to have their claims denied. VA continues to rely on a ``Gulf 
War Illness General Medical DBQ'' that is not singular in nature for 
claims of GWI, but instead rely on the subjective, non-medically 
trained construal of a claims assistant to interpret a veteran's 
claimed conditions and schedule the appropriate VA examinations. When 
asked about the possibility of the creation of a more favorable DBQ, 
the response of record was that ``VA would look into the issue'' and 
``First, we have to confirm that [lack of a single DBQ] is a real 
problem.'' However, every Veterans Service Organization sitting at this 
table has offered data, verifiable stories, and written statements as 
to that very point, yet the problems in rating these claims continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Beyond the VFW's continued concern with the illogical requirements 
of service-connection for Gulf War Illness, is the downstream effect of 
the appellate process. VFW advocates who represent those whose claims 
were denied continue to recognize the numerous inconsistencies when 
decisions from the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) are remanded to the 
VA Regional Office. In assessing pending appeals for GWI, the VFW 
professional staff at the BVA notes that VA appears to clearly favor 
finding a diagnosis for each reported system and, thereby, rule out 
GWI, rather than further developing and accurately applying the rating 
schedule to a diagnosis that is even a minimally supported one. The VFW 
urges VA to consider both possibilities as existential. Since the 
preponderance of evidence shows the possibility that GWI may exist, the 
balance of evidence as to GWI's nonexistence is equal or in 
``equipoise.'' Therefore, in accordance with section 3.102 of title 38, 
CFR, there exists enough ``Reasonable Doubt'' that VA should develop 
the claim for the potential grant of Gulf War Illness disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Bergman">The VFW suggested in prior testimony that inconsistencies in the 
application of the rating schedule is universal across the VA Regional 
Office spectrum with regard to claims for Gulf War Illness 
disabilities. While we are not in any way suggesting that this is 
deliberate, we continue to put forward that a grant for Gulf War 
Illness in Maine should be exactly the same in Ohio, Iowa, or any other 
VA Regional Office based on the same evidence and fact pattern. VA's 
Office of Performance Analysis and Integrity has demonstrated their 
capability to track data nearly to the key stroke. This presents the 
perfect opportunity to identify and develop best practices across the 
Veterans Benefits Administration in properly adjudicating claims for 
GWI and eliminate the disparities that currently exist. At the very 
least, now that the National Work Queue (NWQ) is in effect, VA could 
easily distribute these ``specialized'' claims to the regional offices 
that have a proven track record in proper application of section 3.317 
of title 38, CFR, with an eye toward the centralization of Gulf War 
Illness claims as is the case with claims for exposure to toxic water 
at Camp Lejeune, Lewisite, Spina Bifida and other ``non-routine'' 
issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Over the past six years, much of VA's effort has been focused on 
the backlog of existing claims. In the attempt to reduce this inventory 
as efficiently and expeditiously as possible, VA has relied exceedingly 
further on the use of contract examiners to meet demand and relieve the 
burden from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). While this has 
allowed VHA to direct resources to provide health care to those already 
service-connected or otherwise enrolled in the VA health care system, 
far too often we are alerted to contract exams that are hastily 
conducted, not performed to VA standard (not compliant with the DBQ 
required to evaluate the disability), or not properly scheduled. For 
this reason, the VFW believes that developing a single DBQ intended 
specifically for identifying and rating Gulf War Illness and accurate, 
continuous training on how to complete these exams will result in the 
proper application of the law and the veteran receiving the 
appropriately awarded benefit their service has earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Bergman">As one of the nation's largest VSOs responsible for providing 
direct assistance to veterans seeking their earned benefits, the VFW 
continues to urge Congress to employ its oversight authority regarding 
the development of a single use DBQ for Gulf War Illness, proper 
training for VA examiners and claims adjudicators, and the 
consideration of centralizing these claims through the NWQ to ensure 
consistency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Messrs. Chairmen, this concludes my testimony. I will be happy to 
answer any questions you or the Subcommittee members may have.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Prepared Statement of Anthony Hardie</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Thank you, Chairmen Bergman and Bost, Ranking Members Kuster and 
Esty, and Members of the Subcommittees for today's hearing and for the 
invitation to speak with you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Bergman">I'm Anthony Hardie, National Board Chair and Director of Veterans 
for Common Sense (VCS), and a U.S. Army veteran of the 1991 Gulf War 
and Somalia. VCS and I have provided testimony on many previous 
occasions, most recently in February and March 2016 for Gulf War health 
and benefits hearings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Today's hearing is focused on the latest Government Accountability 
(GAO) report related to Gulf War Illness (GWI) issues, with bottom line 
finding of an 87 percent overall denial rate that is three times worse 
than any other type of claim the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) 
adjudicates. However, the GAO report delves deeper into these GWI 
claims issues and their intertwined relationship with medical research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Bergman">These serious issues have profound real-world impact on Gulf War 
veterans. Please see Exhibit 1, attached to this testimony, that 
provides a number of Gulf War veterans' accounts of how their own VA 
claims for GWI issues were denied. The negative impact on these 
veterans compels us today to seek to find solutions to favorably impact 
them and help to relieve their suffering however we can.
2017 GAO REPORT ON GWI CLAIMS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Bergman">Specifically for Gulf War Illness (Chronic Multisymptom (CMI) and 
Undiagnosed Illness (UDX)) claims, this new 2017 GAO report \1\ found:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\1\ U.S. Government Accountability Office, ``Gulf War Illness: 
Improvements Needed for VA to Better Understand, Process, and 
Communicate Decisions on Claims'' (GAO-17-511), June 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  TRIPLE THE DENIAL RATE: ``.the approval rate for Gulf War 
Illness medical issues was 17 percent (about 18,000 of 102,00 issues 
rated), which was about 3 times lower than all other medical issues at 
57 percent (about 14 million of 24.7 million issues rated).''; ``This 
approval rate was consistently lower than that of the non-Gulf War 
Illness medical issues.'' (p. 18)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  WORSE FOR UDX CLAIMS: ``.eight VBA regional offices had 
approval rates of 5 percent or less for undiagnosed illness medical 
issues.'' (p. 22)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  WORSENING OVER TIME: ``Approval rates . decreased from 
fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2015.'' (p. 18)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  VA UNDERREPORTED GWI CLAIMS: ``.the number of completed 
[GWI] claims . may be underreported due to unclear guidance and 
inconsistent data entry over time by VBA's claim rating staff.''; 
``.staff had not been consistently identifying these medical issues as 
Gulf War Illness-related.''; ``[GAO] tested the data to determine the 
potential magnitude of the underreporting [of GWI issues]. and found 
approximately 57,000.''; ``The number of veterans associated with 
claims for these medical issues was about 41,000.''; ``.VBA is not 
planning to correct these data from prior years.'' (pp. 15-16)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  GWI CLAIMS TAKE 50% LONGER: ``.[GWI] claims took about 4 
months longer for VBA to complete than all other types of claims, 
averaging about 1 year compared to about 8 months.'' (p. 17); And, 
``.[GWI] claims with eight or more medical issues took on average 1 
month longer to complete than Gulf War Illness claims with seven or 
fewer medical issue.'' (p. 17, footnote). This means veterans who are 
the worst off have to wait the longest for the help they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  DECISION LETTERS ARE FLAWED: ``.decision letters for 
denied claims do not communicate key information to veterans'', 
including, ``why the claim was denied'' (p. ii), and, ``.could lead the 
veteran to conclude that their claim was denied because . VBA had not 
considered it under the presumptive method of service connection.'' 
(pp. 24-25). This is despite a 2002 GAO report (GAO-02-395) that noted 
that ``unclear decision letters can confuse claimants.'' (p. 25, 
footnote).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  NO CONSISTENCY BETWEEN EXAMINERS: ``Medical examiners 
have different views on and approaches for how to assess veterans for 
undiagnosed illnesses, in part, because of the challenge of identifying 
something as an undiagnosed or unexplainable illness.'' (p. 22)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  UDX IS UNWORKABLE: ``Medical examiners at one clinic told 
us that they could nearly always attribute a veteran's symptoms to a 
diagnosable illness, which would mean the veteran does not qualify for 
benefits under the undiagnosed illness presumptive category.''; ``.two 
examiners said that to determine that a veteran should be categorized 
as having an undiagnosed illness, they would have to rule out all known 
diseases that could cause the veterans symptoms. Doing so, however, is 
beyond the scope of a medical exam for disability compensation 
purposes.'' (p. 22)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  INADEQUATE TRAINING IMPEDES ACCURACY: ``VA's ability to 
accurately process GWI claims is hampered by inadequate training''; 
``VA has developed elective GWI training for its medical examiners, but 
only 10 percent of examiners had taken the training as of February 
2017'' (p. ii), an ``.optional 90-minute web-based training course.'' 
(pp. 22-23). By contrast, ``.they must complete training courses before 
performing certain specialty medical exams, such as for traumatic brain 
injury or post-traumatic stress disorder.'' (p. 23)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  EXAMINERS' ERRORS MAY RESULT IN CLAIM DENIAL: ``.VHA 
medical examiners sometimes provide a medical opinion related to 
service connection when one is not necessary because the veteran has a 
presumptive condition.. This opinion may include language that 
indicates the veteran's presumptive condition may not be relate to 
their service.''; ``.if VBA claim raters do not recognize that the 
medical examiner has provided an unnecessary medical opinion about 
service connection for a presumptive condition, they may inadvertently 
deny a claim that should be presumptively granted.'' (p. 22)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  WITH AN 87% DENIAL RATE, TRAINING ISN'T THE ONLY ISSUE: 
This is evidenced by the finding that ``.98 percent of VBA's rating 
staff had completed . training.'' Despite this level of training, VA 
still denies GWI claims at extraordinary rates. (p. 21, footnote)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  NO CONSISTENCY BETWEEN REGIONAL OFFICES: ``VBA provides 
guidance to its claims staff regarding when to request this medical 
exam; however, we found different interpretations of the guidance among 
staff in the four regional offices we visited.'' (p. 20)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  VA STAFF DON'T UNDERSTAND GWI: ``These Gulf War Illness 
medical issues may be denied at a higher rate, in part, because 
according to VA officials, Gulf War Illness is not always well 
understood by VA staff..'' (p. 19)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  NO GWI CASE DEFINITION, NO ACTION PLAN TO DEVELOP ONE: 
``The National Academy of Medicine and VA's Research Advisory Committee 
on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses both recognize that establishing a 
single case definition has been challenging and noted the risks of 
adopting one that is either too narrow or too broad. Nevertheless, they 
both identified steps VA can take toward this goal.'' (p. 30, 
footnote). ``In its 2015 Gulf War Research Strategic Plan, VA included 
an objective to develop a single case definition, but an official told 
GAO that VA had no action plan in place to achieve it.'' (p. ii); 
``.the persistent lack of a single case definition for Gulf War Illness 
contributes to many of the current challenges with the Gulf War Illness 
disability compensation program.'' . ``Without a documented plan to 
establish a single case definition, VA may miss opportunities to focus 
its efforts and advance knowledge about Gulf War Illness, and 
potentially improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of affected 
veterans.'' (p. 32)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  NO VA REPORTING: ``According to VBA officials, VA does 
not publicly report on the total number of Gulf War veterans who 
receive disability compensation benefits for Gulf War Illness.'' (p. 1)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  VBA CAN'T ADEQUATELY REPORT ON OTHER PRESUMPTIONS: ``VBA 
officials noted that it may be more useful to compare Gulf War Illness 
approval rates to those of other types of presumptive disability 
claims, such as those for presumptive illnesses VA associates with 
exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. However, the data 
provided to us by VBA did not allow us to conduct this analysis.'' (p. 
18, footnote)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  STILL NO CONSISTENT VA USE OF THE TERM ``GULF WAR 
ILLNESS,'' despite strong NAS recommendations to use this term. ``In 
2015, VA's Office of Research and Development officially adopted the 
term `Gulf War Illness presenting as chronic multisymptom illness' to 
describe symptoms of undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained 
chronic multisymptom illness.'' (p. 6, footnote)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  VA DOESN'T HEED RECOMMENDATIONS: ``According to a June 
2014 report published by [a VA] internal workgroup, VA had yet to 
implement many recommendations related to programs and services for 
Gulf War veterans made by internal task forces and external advisory 
committees to senior VA leadership over the years. In June 2014, this 
workgroup's environmental scan identified several deficiencies 
regarding VA's response to Gulf War Illness, including that there is: 
*no overarching Department-level strategy for Gulf War veterans; *no 
well-coordinated process for receiving recommendations or implementing 
plans to respond to recommendations; and *no clear consensus on a 
single case definition for Gulf War Illness.'' (p. 12)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  PROCESS FOR NEW PRESUMPTIVES FLAWED: GAO notes that some 
VA research, ``.is directly relevant to the disability compensation 
program; for example, it has been used to establish additional 
presumptive conditions.'' (p. 26). However, no examples are cited 
because, beyond nine infectious endemic diseases, VA has found none. 
``VA has not identified any new presumptive conditions that it 
associates with Gulf War service since adding the nine infectious 
diseases in 2010.'' (p. 29). ``Some presumptive conditions have been 
added through legislation. As we previously noted, in 1994 a 
presumptive service connection for ``undiagnosed illness'' for Gulf War 
veterans was established, and in 2001 legislation was enacted 
establishing ``medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illnesses'' 
as being presumptively service connected for these veterans.'' (p. 27, 
footnote)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  BRAIN CANCER PRESUMPTIVE DENIED: ``VA officials said the 
agency decided not to proceed, citing limited scientific evidence from 
a 2016 National Academy of Medicine report.'' (p. 29)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  GAO RECOMMENDED VA: ``.require medical examiners to 
complete training . before conducting these exams.''; ``. require that 
decision letters indicate whether Gulf War Illness medical issues were 
evaluated under both a presumptive and direct service connection 
method.''; and, ``...prepare and document a plan to develop a single 
case definition of Gulf War Illness.'' . ``This plan should include 
near- and long-term specific actions, such as analyzing and leveraging 
information in existing datasets and identifying any areas for future 
research to help VA achieve this goal.'' (p. 32)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  VA AGREED: ``VA said it plans to make its 90-minute web-
based training course mandatory for its medical examiners who conduct 
Gulf War Illness exams. VA also stated it will improve how it 
communicates decisions to veterans and is in the process of updating 
its guidance to the regional offices to clarify the language required 
for its Gulf War Illness decision letters. Finally, VA said it will 
convene a group of subject matter experts to work on a plan-as 
described in our report-to establish a single case definition of Gulf 
War Illness.'' (p. 33)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  GAO ADMONISHMENT - ACTION PLANS: ``According to federal 
internal control standards, an agency's objectives should be defined in 
specific terms, including clearly defining how the objective is to be 
achieved and who is responsible for achieving the objective, as well as 
establishing time frames for meeting the agency's goal. These measures 
allow agencies to track progress toward achieving their goals.'' (p. 
31, footnote)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Bergman">&amp;lt;bullet&amp;gt;  GAO ADMONISHMENT - COMPETENCE IS A BASIC PRINCIPLE: 
``Demonstrating a commitment to competence is a principle of federal 
internal control standards.'' (p. 23, footnote)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Bergman">This latest GAO report is just the latest in a long line of GAO, 
Congressional, and other investigations. In 1996, a GAO investigation 
found that VA had denied Gulf War veterans' undiagnosed illness (UDX) 
claims under the 1994 law at a rate of 95 percent. \2\ Additional 
hearings, legislation, advocacy, and major public outcry by the 
nation's ill Gulf War veterans eventually resulted in two major bills 
enacted in 1998 that sought to fix these issues with what appeared to 
be a clear, comprehensive framework for Gulf War veterans' healthcare, 
research, and disability benefits. \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Bergman">\2\ U.S. General Accounting Office, ``Veterans' Compensation: 
Evidence Considered in Persian Gulf War Undiagnosed Illness Claims'' 
(GAO/HEHS-96-112), May 1996, p. 3.</paragraph>

    <option>submission for the record of March 6, 2016 for a joint O&amp;amp;I and 
Disability and Memorial Affairs subcommittees, these were the Persian 
Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998 (Title XVI, P.L. 105-277) and the 
Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-368, Title I-
``Provisions Relating to Veterans of Persian Gulf War and Future 
Conflicts'') were two landmark bills, that, ``for those of us involved 
in fighting for the creation and enactment of these laws, they seemed 
clear and straightforward, with a comprehensive, statutorily-mandated 
plan that would guarantee research, treatments, appropriate benefits, 
and help ensure that lessons learned from our experiences would result 
in never again allowing what happened to us to happen to future 
generations of warriors.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The next major update followed shortly thereafter. Legislation in 
2001 added signs and symptoms of undiagnosed illness, and ``medically 
unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (such as chronic fatigue 
syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome) that is defined 
by a cluster of signs or symptoms.)''. \4\ This was the last 
significant legislative change to Gulf War Illness claims.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ Public Law 107-103, the ``Veterans Education and Benefits 
Expansion Act of 2001,'' was enacted December 27, 2001; Section 202, 
``Payment of Compensation for Persian Gulf War Veterans with Certain 
Chronic Disabilities,'' took effect March 1, 2002.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, as we described last year, the implementation of all of 
these Gulf War laws aimed at helping ill Gulf War veterans has been 
fraught with challenges. Myriad VA-contracted National Academy of 
Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine (IOM)) literature reviews, 
at a cost of millions upon millions of dollars, have resulted in no new 
presumptive conditions related to Gulf War Illness, no new case 
definition of Gulf War Illness, no better assistance for ill Gulf War 
veterans seeking VA healthcare or benefits.
