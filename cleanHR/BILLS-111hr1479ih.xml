			<paragraph id="H23EF58009F3A42488BA75BB9DCD90524"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Because the
			 Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 requires that community needs be met in a
			 safe and sound manner, the Act must be updated and applied to nonbank financial
			 institutions as well as depository institutions.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0EDFFF1A323A4E4EA584269F69FD0000"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Community
			 Reinvestment Act of 1977 promotes community development through financing
			 activities including affordable housing (rental and homeowner), small
			 businesses, and economic development.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0D115A373E854C05B580C21E7D1BC78"><enum>(3)</enum><text>It
			 is necessary to increase homeownership and small business ownership for low-
			 and moderate-income borrowers and persons of color through safe and sound
			 lending. It also is necessary to close the wealth gap in the United States and
			 to increase access to insurance and securities products.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H58AC8D0D125843FF8695F7AE122F66A8"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Community
			 Reinvestment Act of 1977 has been effective in increasing access to credit and
			 capital because it imposes an affirmative and continual obligation on banks and
			 thrifts to meet the needs of the local communities in which they are
			 chartered.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H138E4556ACD34A2B8C8FF632268C6D01"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The Community
			 Reinvestment Act of 1977 has leveraged more than $6,000,000,000,000 in loans
			 and investments for low- and moderate-income communities according to the
			 National Community Reinvestment Coalition.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H3F12670CD2BB47EE9BD1C22DC70241B"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Major studies,
			 including those conducted by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Board of
			 Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Harvard University, have found
			 that the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 increases home mortgage lending to
			 minority and low- and moderate-income communities and that this lending is
			 profitable.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0DEE35229DB44E4DB42BF8A0071CF38"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The Community
			 Reinvestment Act of 1977 has leveraged a tremendous increase in home mortgage
			 lending to minority and low- and moderate-income borrowers as compared to
			 Whites and middle-income borrowers; from 1993 through 2002, home mortgage
			 lending has increased by 79.5 percent to Blacks, by 185.8 percent to Hispanics,
			 by 29.6 percent to Whites, by 90.6 percent to low- and moderate-income
			 borrowers, and by 51.4 percent to middle-income borrowers.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HA2A91396813944E684EBD2315388D77F"><enum>(8)</enum><text>As recorded by
			 data required by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the annual dollar
			 amount of community development loans more than tripled—from $17,700,000,000 in
			 1996 to $63,800,000,000 in 2007. Depository institutions also made 14,800,000
			 small business loans totaling more than $581,000,000,000 in low- and
			 moderate-income neighborhoods from 1996 through 2007.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H35D6A86A63264F34A3A00000EC741947"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Yet, inequalities
			 in access to credit and barriers to healthy product choice remain: the Board of
			 Governors of the Federal Reserve System documents that lenders covered by the
			 Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 are less likely to offer high-cost and risky
			 loan products such as piggyback loans than lenders which are not subject to
			 such Act.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H75373AC520884F6B9053DBE0E5259C1C"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The
			 disproportionate amount of high-cost lending in minority and working class
			 communities would be reduced if the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was
			 expanded to non-bank institutions currently not covered by the Act.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HA25772C5C35D49C0B81052E92D373707"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Wealth
			 inequalities are stark, and could be reduced in reinvestment requirements were
			 extended to other segments of the financial industry.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HB3F59366D2674DD8A3EFD6F789AE8F91"><enum>(12)</enum><text>In 2002, the
			 median net worth for Hispanic and African-American households was $7,932 and
			 $5,988 respectively, while, in sharp contrast, the median net worth for White
			 households was $88,651.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H91BD64801C4F49D2A15FC665CF835EE1"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Access to
			 insurance remains unequal, as research conducted by the chief economist of the
			 National Association of Insurance Commissioners found that after controlling
			 for risk of loss, a 10 percentage point increase in the number of minorities in
			 a zip code is associated with a 2 percentage point increase in the number of
			 <quote>FAIR plans</quote>, which are Government-sponsored insurance plans of
			 last resort for those who cannot obtain insurance in the private market.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HEDAD0570771E4B7AAD68F4EBC4314C92"><enum>(14)</enum><text>In order to
			 increase access to credit, wealth and insurance, it is necessary to modernize
			 the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to reflect shifting trends in the
			 financial services industry as mergers among banks and non-bank financial
			 institutions as well as changes in banking and lending practices.</text>
