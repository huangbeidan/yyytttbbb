<paragraph id="H9A3B169CA1EC46309C2C9811A9620392"><enum>(1)</enum><text>one of the primary missions of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage insurance program is to reach borrowers who are underserved, or not served, by the existing conventional mortgage marketplace;</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H9DA7074E6B3E441900CD6781418DF00"><enum>(2)</enum><text>the FHA program has a long history of innovation, which includes pioneering the 30-year self-amortizing mortgage and a safe-to-seniors reverse mortgage product, both of which were once thought too risky to private lenders;</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H9BE6B26364254B4D92EA9EB8FDF31732"><enum>(3)</enum><text>the FHA single family mortgage insurance program traditionally has been a major provider of mortgage insurance for home purchases;</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H02155CAD031F4F759D9303AA03DADB31"><enum>(4)</enum><text>the FHA mortgage insurance premium structure, as well as FHA’s product offerings, should be revised to reflect FHA’s enhanced ability to determine risk at the loan level and to allow FHA to better respond to changes in the mortgage market;</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H62BC0D93CA9E4FE4BDEDC3397078CA31"><enum>(5)</enum><text>during past recessions, including the oil-patch downturns in the mid-1980s, FHA remained a viable credit enhancer and was therefore instrumental in preventing a more catastrophic collapse in housing markets and a greater loss of homeowner equity; and</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HB9A71F2437B24470B9E7FA1CAF9D7ECB"><enum>(6)</enum><text>as housing price appreciation slows and interest rates rise, many homeowners and prospective homebuyers will need the less-expensive, safer financing alternative that FHA mortgage insurance provides.</text> </paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection id="H4AFFC0FE7F5F45DB96C2228C8E1D049B"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Purposes</header><text>The purposes of this Act are—</text> 
<paragraph id="HD22524506CC5404F9D41B87BEC246223"><enum>(1)</enum><text>to provide flexibility to FHA to allow for the insurance of housing loans for low- and moderate-income homebuyers during all economic cycles in the mortgage market;</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H3255F2EFB9374290988FC21D46722E11"><enum>(2)</enum><text>to modernize the FHA single family mortgage insurance program by making it more reflective of enhancements to loan-level risk assessments and changes to the mortgage market; and</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H1C25D89748674B55B5247D1F3500DA73"><enum>(3)</enum><text>to adjust the loan limits for the single family mortgage insurance program to reflect rising house prices and the increased costs associated with new construction.</text></paragraph></subsection></section>
