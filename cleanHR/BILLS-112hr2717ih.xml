			 strategic position made it vulnerable to enemy attack by German U-boats, which
			 marauded shipping off our beaches. In July 1943, in perhaps the only German
			 attack on the United States, a U-boat fired at the Ethel-Dow chemical plant in
			 Wilmington. Wilmington endured this attack, as well as constant civilian
			 defense restrictions and air raid drills, including black-outs and dim-outs.
			 The city’s population more than doubled with the influx of military personnel,
			 forcing locals to cope with strain on housing and schools, transportation,
			 medical and social services, law enforcement, and food supply.</text>
