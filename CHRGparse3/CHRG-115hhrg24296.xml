    <Statement>
    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY, A</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY">    REPRESENTATIVE FROM TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON ARMED 
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY">    The Chairman. The committee will come to order. Today, we 
have at this portion three items of official business to 
consider: adoption of the rules, the security procedures, and 
the appointment of committee staff.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY">    Before we do that, let me just take a brief moment and 
welcome returning and new members to the committee and also 
express some condolences to those members who are here with us 
for a day and are being forced to leave us after this.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY">    The truth is this is a special committee. Most people 
believe that it is the President or the military's job to 
decide how big the military ought to be and what weapons they 
ought to have and so forth. If you look at Article 1, Section 
8, it says it is Congress' responsibility to raise and support 
armies, to provide and maintain a navy, to make rules for the 
government and regulation of the land and naval forces of the 
United States. That puts the responsibility on our shoulders, 
and it is a significant responsibility because, as we all know, 
men and women volunteer to serve our Nation and defend us and 
put their lives at stake, but they are counting on us.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY">    The rest of the story is, for 55 straight years, 
Congresses, with majorities from both parties, and Presidents 
of both parties have found a way to come together and pass a 
national defense authorization bill, 55 straight years.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY">    Now, there have been some hiccups along the way. It hadn't 
always been easy, but that bipartisan tradition of coming 
together for the men and women who serve for the security of 
our Nation is also something, I think, that weighs on us and 
our responsibilities.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY">    This year, we have got to exercise those responsibilities 
in a world that is growing more dangerous and more complex. We 
are going to work hard. We are going to have lots of sessions 
of various kinds, but I am very excited about the tremendous 
breadth and depth of talent on both sides of the aisle that 
this committee has. And I very much look forward to working 
with each of you and the contributions that each of you will 
make to our product this year.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY">    Let me yield to the distinguished ranking member for any 
comments he makes before we move on to the rules.
STATEMENT OF HON. ADAM SMITH, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM WASHINGTON, 
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="HON. WILLIAM M. ``MAC'' THORNBERRY">          RANKING MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Smith</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Smith"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Smith">    I would merely echo your comments. I think you described 
the job of this committee very well. It is a great committee. I 
have been privileged to serve on it for 20 years under a number 
of different chairs in both parties. I think the fact that we 
work together in a bipartisan way to produce a very important 
product every year makes this committee, frankly, unique in the 
House at this point.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Smith">    And I have enjoyed working with you, respect the way you 
run the committee, and I look forward to an interesting year. 
We have a lot to do, to be sure. But as you said, we have very, 
very talented members of this committee. And I guess the only 
thing I would add, which I know you have said many times as 
well, we also have an incredibly talented staff that does an 
enormous amount of work and makes this possible. So I thank 
them as well and look forward to working with all of you in the 
year ahead.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Smith">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Smith">    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Smith">    Let me go ahead and call up Committee Resolution No. 1, 
regarding the committee rules for the 115th Congress. The clerk 
will read the resolution.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Smith">    Dr. Bright. Committee Resolution No. 1. Resolved, that the 
Committee on Armed Services, U.S. House of Representatives, 
adopt the committee rules for the 115th Congress, which are 
stated in the copy distributed to each member.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Smith">    The Chairman. The proposed committee rules have been 
developed jointly with the ranking member and made available to 
members' offices earlier this week following consultation with 
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Smith">    I ask unanimous consent the resolution be considered as 
read and the resolution be open to amendment at any point.
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Smith">    Without objection, it is so ordered.
