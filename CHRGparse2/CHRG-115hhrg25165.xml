    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TIM MURPHY, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Mr. Murphy&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt; Good morning and welcome to this hearing of the
Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on ``Ways to Improve 
and Strengthen the International Anti-Doping System.''
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    The subcommittee convenes to examine the current state of 
this system, the challenges it faces and areas for reform.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    On the heels of the Summer Games in Rio and less than a 
year away from the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, there is no 
better time to evaluate progress made thus far in reforming the 
international anti-doping system. How fitting that we are 
holding this hearing on February the 28th, as we have the 
greatest Olympic athlete of all time, who has won 28 medals, 
before us today. And I wasn't referring to you, Mr. Griffith, I 
was referring to Michael Phelps.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    Every 2 years, nations are filled with excitement and pride 
as they cheer on their athletes of the Summer and Winter Games. 
It has been a longstanding tradition that should not be 
tarnished by those that choose to cheat. Ultimately, I hope 
that this hearing helps to highlight ways in which we can 
strengthen clean competition and restore public confidence in 
international sports.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    Within the anti-doping community there are concerns 
regarding organizational structure and how the current system 
creates an environment where individuals are both policing and 
promoting sport. Conflicts of interest stemming from the 
composition of the World Anti-Doping Agency's, or WADA, senior 
leadership currently exists as anti-doping decision makers 
often simultaneously hold a policymaking position within a 
sports organization. Such conflicts can have both real and 
perceived effects on the rigorous investigations of possible 
violations as well as the enforcement of anti-doping measures.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    Several anti-doping experts have publicly stated that WADA 
lacks sufficient independence from sports itself. Recent 
proposals have suggested removing sports organizations from 
governance structures to improve independence and operations. 
Today we want to evaluate those concerns and discuss the 
proposed reforms. Further, there needs to be an established 
decision making process and body when it comes to 
investigations and sanctions.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    As we saw leading up to the Summer Games in Rio, the buck 
was passed multiple times between the International Olympic 
Committee, the national anti-doping organizations, and 
international sports federations as to who was in charge of 
making the decisions and whether or not athletes would be able 
to participate in the Summer Games.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    Sanctions and bans on athletes, coaches, NADOs, and anti-
doping laboratories vary from short term to lifetime, but there 
does not appear to be a clear set of guidelines to aid the 
appropriate organization in setting and imposing consistent 
penalties. We need to ensure that the system is fair, and that 
the punishment is appropriate, particularly when the athlete 
knowingly cheated. The general public depends on the governing 
bodies of international sports to ensure that cheating does not 
become the accepted norm, and this is a particularly important 
message for our youth.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    Additionally, recent events highlight the need to examine 
potential improvements with respect to utilizing athletes as 
partners in the anti-doping effort as well as whistleblower 
protections. There will always be athletes and institutions 
that dope in an attempt to gain an unfair competitive 
advantage.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    Athletes and whistleblowers are oftentimes the first to see 
the problems at the ground level and are critical to anti-
doping organizations' ability to identify and investigate 
violations. Therefore, it bears questioning whether the current 
system does enough to encourage, embrace, and protect those 
fighting for clean sport.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    While many summits, conferences, and meetings have occurred 
since the Rio Games, challenges remain and progress towards 
meaningful reform remains unclear. This hearing provides an 
opportunity to learn from past mistakes and examine 
opportunities to move forward in a way that will improve the 
international anti-doping system so that it is effective, fair, 
and nimble for the sake of athletes, clean sport, and integrity 
of the international competition, including the Olympic Games.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    Finally, some may ask why Congress is doing a hearing on 
sports rules and is it because it is a matter of the 
multibillion-dollar sports economy? Maybe. In part it may be 
that. But for the most part, I believe that it is very 
important that we send the right message to the youth and 
future athletes of the world that cheating is not acceptable on 
any level, whether it is in our economy, it is in trade, or it 
is in sports.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    We welcome our all-star panel of witnesses today. Your 
appearance before this subcommittee is vital for us to have an 
honest discussion with key decision makers. We are also excited 
to have Mr. Phelps and Mr. Nelson with us today to share the 
athletes' perspective. These gentlemen have competed at the 
highest level and have invaluable insights into the problems 
and challenges that face the current system as well as a unique 
perspective on improvements that can be made.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Murphy"&gt;    I would like to thank our witnesses for appearing today and 
look forward to an informative discussion.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;

    &lt;opening&gt;OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DEGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO&lt;/opening&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="1" speaker="HON. DIANA DEGETTE"&gt; With that, I now yield 5 minutes to Ms. DeGette
of Colorado.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;speaker&gt;Ms. DeGette&lt;/speaker&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt; Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Another
doping scandal has now shaken the sporting world. This time it 
involves a wide-ranging Russian scheme to circumvent doping 
controls relied on by the global sports community to ensure 
clean sport. After unfortunate delays in investigating serious 
claims made by courageous whistleblowers, the World Anti-Doping 
Agency, or WADA, eventually launched investigations into 
allegations that Russia was systematically involved in doping.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    In July and December of last year, Professor Richard 
McLaren, the person commissioned by WADA as the independent 
expert tasked with looking into these allegations, released his 
findings. What WADA's independent investigations reported was a 
systematic effort by Russia to help its athletes both dope and 
circumvent doping controls.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    The doping was widespread according to WADA's report, 
implicating the London Olympic Games, the Sochi Olympic Games, 
the IAAF World Championships, and many other international 
events. Frankly, we will probably never know the full extent of 
the cheating and who benefited. As many as 1,000 Russian 
athletes across at least 30 sports might have benefited from 
this effort according to WADA's investigation.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
    &lt;paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. DeGette"&gt;    WADA's inquiry also found that the very agencies created to 
police sport from doping, including the Russian National Anti-
Doping Agency, were itself helping to cheat. Even Russia's 
Federal Security Service, or FSB, played a role. Russia's 
behavior raises troubling questions about how the global sports 
community should sanction doping violators and whether they are 
actually committed to that fact. For example, because WADA's 
investigative findings were made weeks before the start of Rio 
Games, confusion surfaced about whether Russia should 
collectively be banned from Rio. WADA recommended to the IOC 
that it prohibit the entire Russian delegation from 
participating.
&lt;/paragraph&gt;
