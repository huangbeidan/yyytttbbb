                     Wednesday, September 27, 2017
            Committee on Veterans' Affairs,
                    U. S. House of Representatives,
                                                   Washington, D.C.
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 3:04 p.m., in 
Room 334, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Jodey Arrington 
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Arrington, Bilirakis, Rutherford, 
Banks, O'Rourke, Takano, and Correa.

    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF JODEY ARRINGTON, CHAIRMAN</opening>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Good afternoon, everyone. I want to welcome
you all to the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity's hearing 
today entitled ``How to Improve Access To GI Bill Approved 
Apprenticeship Programs and How these Programs Benefit our 
Veterans.'' Expanding employment and training opportunities for 
veterans is the core mission of this Subcommittee, and today, 
we are here to review, what I believe to be, one of the best 
unknown and underutilized programs designed to help veterans 
achieve economic success. And we want to change that unknown 
part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Arrington">By using VA's on-the-job training and apprenticeship 
programs, veterans are able to supplement their incomes with 
both the stipend payments from VA for their post-9/11 GI Bill 
benefits as well as the wages from their employer while they 
are a trainee. Most importantly, at the end of their training 
program, they are able to step right into a beneficial career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I strongly believe there is a growing need to better align 
student outcomes to higher education funding, and I have 
commented on that before. And I don't know many majors or 
programs at institutions of higher learning that can guarantee 
a job, essentially, at the end of their programs. This promise 
of employment through apprenticeship training is what makes 
this program so special.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Despite many of its positives, there are--very few veterans 
decide to enroll in an apprenticeship program through their GI 
Bill benefits. In fact, the latest data from the Student 
Veterans of America NVEST project found that only 6 percent of 
students who have used the post-9/11 GI Bill are in an OJT or 
apprenticeship program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Arrington">A 2015 GAO report found that those veterans who do find out 
about this are more likely to obviously avail themselves of the 
program. The report also found out that the VA is not doing a 
sufficient job of educating those veterans in transition. The 
GAO report also mentions the paper-based system that is 
inefficient and burdensome. And, finally, the GAO recommended 
the VA do a better job of tracking student outcomes, which I 
know we all on this Committee are interested in, and to know if 
this program is working and what needs to be fixed to make it 
work better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about VA's 
response to these recommendations and the progress that has 
been made since 2015. I am also concerned about reports we have 
received that the antiquated approval criteria for these 
programs make it incredibly difficult for larger employers to 
create a meaningful apprenticeship program that is approvable 
across State lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I look forward to hearing from Dr. Wescott, with the State 
Approving Agencies, about how we can streamline these 
procedures to incentivize the creation of positive programs 
while maintaining appropriate quality and oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Finally, I am interested in hearing about our private 
sector witnesses, about the great things that they are doing 
for veterans, and their experiences with the OJT and 
apprenticeship programs, as well as why veterans are valuable 
to their programs and workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I do want to mention: I thought it was a little odd that we 
invited the Department of Labor, and they have some policy that 
they can't serve on a panel alongside nongovernment witnesses. 
And I just find that odd, and it certainly is inefficient for 
us to do our job and ascertain information from all 
stakeholders to improve the process, improve the service, and 
help our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Arrington">And I met with the Secretary the other day on an unrelated 
issue, and he seems like a guy who has a good deal of common 
sense and good judgment, and I just can't imagine that he is 
aware of this. I can't imagine that he would support that. So I 
hope that changes so we can do our job and get to the bottom of 
these program inefficiencies, cost-effectiveness, and outcome 
opportunities. And enough about that. I don't want to belabor 
that, but I was surprised by that, and I wanted to note that 
publicly.</paragraph>
    <opening>OPENING STATEMENT OF BETO O'ROURKE, RANKING MEMBER</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="BETO O'ROURKE">With that, I want to recognize my friend and Ranking 
Member, Mr. O'Rourke, for his opening remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="BETO O'ROURKE">Mr. O'Rourke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate 
your work and that of your staff and the minority staff in 
bringing this hearing together. Those who are about to testify, 
some of whom we have heard many times at this table before and 
in roundtables that you have convened on the issue of earned 
educational benefits for veterans and how they transition into 
civilian life and are more successful and competitive by the 
oversight that this Committee, this Congress, and the folks who 
are here to testify are helping with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="BETO O'ROURKE">    Out of interest in hearing from the panel and because I am 
going to leave earlier than I would like, to attend an Armed 
Services Committee hearing, I will conclude my opening 
statement with that and allow you to begin the meeting.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Well, then I am going to cut my introduction
short and just say let's start with General Worley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Arrington">And the rest of the panel, if they would make their way, so 
we can get this hearing started, because I do want the Ranking 
Member to be here as long as he can, maximize his time and--</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    Mr. O'Rourke. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Arrington">You bet. And General Worley is the Director
of VA's Education Service.</paragraph>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II, USAF (RET.)</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">General Worley, thanks again for coming, and you have got 5 
minutes. The floor is yours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">General Worley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, 
Ranking Member O'Rourke, and Members of the Subcommittee. I am 
pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of Veterans 
Affairs' education and benefits programs. My testimony will 
focus on VA's administration of apprenticeship training under 
the post-9/11 GI Bill and other programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">Public Law 111-377 signed into law on January 4, 2011, 
amended the post-9/11 GI Bill and expanded the benefits and 
access to programs available to eligible participants. The 
post-9/11 GI Bill is the most utilized, as you know, of VA's 
educational assistance programs. Apprenticeship programs are 
available to eligible veterans through their VA education 
benefits, including the post-9/11 GI Bill. These programs allow 
veterans to learn a trade or skill through training, instead of 
attending formal classroom instruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">A veteran generally enters into a training contract for a 
specific period with an employer, and at the end of the 
training period, the veteran gains job certifications or 
journey worker status. Veterans pursuing apprenticeship 
training under the post-9/11 GI Bill receive a monthly housing 
allowance which decreases in 6-month increments as wages are 
increased. Participants also receive up to $83 per month for 
books and supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">The law provides that VA may pay educational assistance to 
eligible veterans and other individuals participating in 
approved training programs. The Department of Labor's 
registered apprenticeships are considered deemed approved, as 
are those approved by DOL or State apprenticeship agencies 
recognized by DOL. State Approving Agencies, SAAs, overseeing 
education and training programs for veterans are responsible 
for approving most non-Federal apprenticeship programs in their 
respective States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">Similarly, VA has authority to approve apprenticeship 
programs offered by Federal agencies, including DOL registered 
apprenticeship programs offered in multiple States by carriers 
directly involved in interstate commerce. Over 1.8 million 
individuals have used their post-9/11 GI Bill benefits since 
inception of the program in August of 2009. And looking 
historically, there have been over 9,200 OJT and apprenticeship 
programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">Looking at all benefit types from fiscal year 2012 through 
fiscal year 2016, over 71,000 beneficiaries pursued training 
through OJT or apprenticeships. And in fiscal year 2017, 
approximately 30,000 beneficiaries are pursuing in this 
training through nearly 5,400 unique OJT or apprenticeship 
programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">VA works with State Approving Agencies to streamline and 
standardize the approval process for apprenticeship programs. 
VA also works very closely with the Department of Labor staff 
to ensure registered apprenticeship sponsors understand the 
approval process for GI Bill benefits. This includes 
participating in teleconferences with employers, providing 
information as necessary, and sharing SAA contact information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">In November of 2015, the VA developed and published an 
informational guide for employers offering or considering 
offering on-the-job training or apprenticeship training to 
veterans and their beneficiaries. A second edition was 
published in July of this year. The VA continues to work with 
the National Association of State Approving Agencies to ensure 
SAAs are aware of participating employers that have received 
national approval, as well as any pending approval concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">There are some challenges in the approval process for 
employers because training may take place in multiple States, 
which, consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, 
normally requires a separate approval by each individual State 
Approving Agency. The VA has worked to enhance the promotion of 
available OJT and apprenticeship opportunities through the 
transition assistance program, outreach events, various 
publications, and other platforms and strategies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="MAJOR GENERAL ROBERT M. WORLEY II">In addition to traditional approaches, the VA uses social 
media outlets to provide greater visibility to enhance the 
awareness of these programs.</paragraph>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Major General Robert M. Worley</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Major General Robert M. Worle">    Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. Thank you for 
the opportunity today. I look forward your to questions.

    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Thank you, Mr. Worley.</paragraph>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF DR. JOSEPH W. WESCOTT</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DR. JOSEPH W. WESCOTT">    Dr. Wescott, with the State Approving Agencies, the floor 
is yours for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Wescott">Chairman Arrington, Ranking Member O'Rourke,
Members of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, I am 
pleased to appear before you today on behalf of the 50-member 
State agencies of the National Association of State Approving 
Agencies, and appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on 
apprenticeship training under the GI Bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Wescott">Mr. Chairman, we certainly believe that working with our VA 
and DOL partners, we can improve in real and substantive ways 
the manner we approve and administer apprenticeship programs, 
and we know that there are ways that we can better inform 
eligible men and women about these programs. We strongly agree 
that outreach efforts need to be improved, and we believe that 
State Approving Agencies can provide a major part of the 
solution. With a slight adjustment in our contractual 
requirements, we could provide a more robust outreach to 
potential employers of veterans and their dependents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Wescott">For example, from fiscal year 2008 until fiscal year 2011, 
SAAs working with our VA partners increase the number of 
approved apprenticeship facilities from 4,471 to 5,285. 
However, since then, the number of approved facilities has 
decreased. In fiscal year 2016, the number of facilities was 
only 4,221. We believe the reason for this decrease is that, in 
the past several years, we and our VA partners have been tasked 
with focusing heavily on oversight of institutions. This 
valuable work has been accomplished with--somewhat at the 
expense of our ability to provide outreach for the OJT and 
apprenticeship programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Wescott">While we are deeply appreciative of this Congress, and 
particularly this Committee, in providing additional funding 
for SAAs, it is important that we now renew our focus on 
outreach and technical assistance to our Nation's veterans and 
potential employers about this valuable program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Wescott">In the past several years, despite limited time and 
resources, SAAs have been creative and innovative in attempting 
to reach employers and veterans with the messages that there is 
another path to employment for them other than college, and one 
that could prove equally rewarding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Wescott">For example, Illinois, which had 357 approved and active 
apprenticeship and OJT facilities last year, has a vigorous 
outreach program, including out-of-stop visits to potential 
employers. The Washington SAA is an active participant in the 
Veterans Resource Employment Group, aimed at promoting the 
employment of veterans and program approval of apprenticeships 
and OJT programs in State government. SAAs will continue to 
work closely with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other 
local agencies or institutions. And with an appropriate shift 
in our focus, SAAs will be able to visit more active on-the-job 
and apprenticeship training programs on a regular basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Wescott">We must point out, however, that the current law limits the 
ability of SAAs to be reimbursed under their contract for 
outreach efforts unless the effort can be linked to a travel 
expense. Standard outreach and marketing strategies, such as 
news media and social media advertising cannot be reimbursed. 
NASAA recommends that 38 U.S.C. 3674 be amended to add an 
additional category of reimbursement for outreach and 
marketing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Wescott">NASAA has long sought the automation of the apprenticeship/
OJT process and claims processing. We certainly understand and 
empathize with the challenges faced by our VA partners in the 
automation arena. But it is truly time to replace the fax 
machine and the U.S. Postal Service as the primary means of 
delivering claims forms. Some headway has been made with the 
recent addition of apprenticeship and OJT enrollment 
certifications to the VA-ONCE online system. But complete 
automation would not only provide veterans with a more timely 
payment of benefits but would provide VA and SAAs with the 
ability to accurately track how many veterans are enrolled in 
approved apprenticeship programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Wescott">NASAA supports the efforts of Congress to modify existing 
laws to clarify the authority of State Approving Agencies, to 
approve registered apprenticeship programs that are based or 
headquartered in their respective State with job sites in 
multiple States. This is model already exists within our joint 
apprenticeship and training committees as well as in the manner 
we approve distance education institutions. And the proposed 
legislation in Congress now simply represents a commonsense 
extension of the model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Wescott">NASAA has worked closely with Congressman Ro Khanna from 
California's 17th Congressional District, and we are excited 
about the potential of this new legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Wescott">Mr. Chairman, the apprenticeship programs under the GI Bill 
provide a tremendous opportunity to put our Nation's veterans 
back to work quickly and in meaningful and rewarding careers 
that are needed in our economy. We applaud the efforts of this

    <opening>STATEMENT OF PAUL MARCHAND</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="PAUL MARCHAND">    And now, for 5 minutes, Mr. Paul Marchand, who is the 
executive vice president for human resources for Charter 
Communications. Mr. Marchand.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman
Arrington, Ranking Member O'Rourke, and distinguished Members 
of the Subcommittee. My name, as you said, is Paul Marchand. I 
am head of HR at Charter Communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Thank you for the invitation here this afternoon to discuss 
a topic that we believe is vital, not just to Charter but to 
the country, and that is to improve economic opportunities for 
our brave men and women through GI Bill approved apprenticeship 
programs. I am honored to be sitting alongside these highly 
regarded representatives from both public and private sectors. 
The organizations represented here today are deeply committed 
and passionate in their support of our country's veterans. And 
we appreciate the Committee's bipartisanship and commitment to 
improving the lives of our veterans who have done so much for 
our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Charter is America's fastest growing TV, internet, and 
Voice Company. We are proud to serve more than 26 million 
customers in 41 States across our land. Every day, a highly 
skilled, diverse workforce helps us deliver better products and 
services under the Spectrum Brand to our customers across our 
footprint. In total, we have 92,000 employees, and we are 
committed to hiring 20,000 more by 2020, primarily by ending 
our reliance on off-shore call centers. And at Charter, we are 
proud to say that veterans are a valued member of our team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Today, Charter employs 12,000 veterans, 13 percent of our 
workforce, and essentially we have double the government's 
recommendation of 7 percent. This year alone, between January 
and August, we have hired approximately 4,000 veterans, and we 
are committed to increasing our overall veteran hiring by 5 
percent over the next 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Veterans' skills, you see, translate very well in our 
company. They bring mission-orientated mindset that is 
effective across all of our business units and all levels of 
our organization. Importantly, we don't just want to hire 
veterans. We want to help them build on technical skills they 
gain from military experiences and begin a second and important 
career with Charter Spectrum. So we attract, we hire, and we 
intend to retain these veterans through several programs and 
partnerships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Marchand">We recruit veterans by going where the servicemembers are, 
at military bases in the communities in which we serve. Charter 
is now part of a new career resource center at Fort Bragg in 
North Carolina. Through that partnership, we provide 4 weeks of 
training to Active-Duty men and women who are in their final 
months of military service. This program allows Charter to 
begin a relationship with these servicemembers and provide them 
a taste of what it is like to work as a technician, and it is 
at this start of a pipeline into our Spectrum Broadband 
Technician Apprenticeship Program and a fulfilling career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Marchand">This well-regarded program, our apprenticeship program, 
allows these newly hired technicians to receive certification. 
These qualified veterans who were discharged in the last 10 
years can secure GI benefits by completing the program's 
classroom curriculum, the required on-the-job training, which 
allows them to both earn tax-free money in addition to their 
Charter paycheck. Today, over a thousand technicians are 
currently enrolled in 5 States that are home to large military 
bases in our program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Marchand">One graduate of such a program, Fabian Luna, was hired as 
an insulation technician just out of the United States Army. 
And since being hired, he has been promoted five times and 
currently works as a Spectrum field tech supervisor in 
Morrisville, North Carolina. Our program has been so successful 
that we are working with the Department of Labor to expand it 
to a national level program, ultimately offering it in all 41 
of our States that we operate in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Moving forward, we have a clear sense of what needs to 
happen to reach commitment to increase hiring in the percentage 
of veterans in our workforce. We will do this by the following: 
growing our presence on bases to ensure we are reaching 
veterans before they leave Active Duty; partnering with key 
military and veteran organizations, like the VFW, Hiring our 
Heroes, and many others; increasing awareness by veterans of 
our hiring roles and opportunities; and ensuring that veterans 
that are hired are not just hired to a job but are given 
opportunities to grow and develop their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Finally, we want to move faster and go further with our 
efforts to increase the number of veterans in our workforce. 
Charter stands ready to work with Federal and State agencies to 
build the awareness of these programs through more robust 
communications and improve the overall process and make it 
easier for companies to offer programs and veterans to apply 
for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Marchand">In closing, our veterans served at us at home, abroad, with 
great sacrifice to themselves and their families, and we owe it 
to them to make sure, when they leave Active Duty, they have 
careers that they continue to be proud of and they can support 
their families with good benefits and real pathways to 
advancement.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Thank you, Mr. Marchand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Arrington">And now I ask Mr. Penski for remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    Mr. Penski, Dan Penski, a special assistant to the general 
president of the International Union of Painters and Allied 
Trades.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF DAN PENSKI</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="DAN PENSKI">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Penski">Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member. Thank
you for the chance to share the International Union of Painters 
and Allied Trades' perspective and the great opportunities for 
veterans in the construction and building trades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Penski">As stated, my name is Dan Penski. I serve as special 
assistant to the general president, Mr. Kenneth Rigmaiden. He 
sends his apologies, as he was unable to sit before you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Penski">I served in the U.S. Marine Corps, Marine Corps Reserves, 
Army National Guard, where I retired in 1998. I began in 1974 
as a glazer apprentice in the IUPAT Local 660, Buffalo, New 
York. I continued as an apprenticeship until reaching my 
journeyman status, where I served as a glazer from 1982 to 
1998, before moving into the IUPAT training department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Penski">My responsibility now is to support and shepherd veterans 
into the Painters and Allied Trades Veterans Program. The IUPAT 
represents industrial and commercial painters, drywall 
finishers, glazers, sign and display, floor coverers across 
North American. A few examples of our high-profile work include 
the painting of the Capitol dome, the installation of the 
exterior and interior glass at the Apple's new headquarters. As 
a matter of fact, our glazers set the largest piece of glass 
ever installed in the cafeteria of Apple's new headquarters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Penski">Training and education are the vehicles to performing high-
quality work to maintain a leading edge in our industry. We 
utilize our Finishing Trades Institute, which is the 
educational and training arm of the IUPAT. Our joint labor-
management relationship drives the success in the training of 
apprentice and journey workers. The FTI is in the leading edge 
of curriculum development, training, and utilizing of new 
industry technology for all of the crafts that we represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Penski">The IUPAT apprenticeship program provides an affordable 
education, does not leave its participants with one penny of 
debt. Our apprenticeship programs are linked to jobs in the 
private and public sectors that earn a living wage and 
benefits. The apprenticeship model that the IUPAT uses is also 
the model of the building and construction trades. It is a 
jointly funded, labor-management model. All of our 
apprenticeship funds across the country are funded through 
contributions, agreed to by labor and management, paid on every 
hour worked. The apprenticeship funds are managed in 
partnership with contractors articulating industry concerns and 
needs, along with identifying recruitment and retention goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Penski">Curriculum is developed in-house at the FTI through labor-
management partnership, making our apprenticeship model a 
successful market-driven approach to delivering a highly 
skilled construction worker. This partnership enables our 
membership to pursue lifelong learning opportunities. Nearly 
two-thirds of all registered apprentices in the United States 
work in the construction industry. Among construction 
apprentices, roughly three-quarters are enrolled in a union-
sponsored apprenticeship program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Penski">Our IUPAT Veterans Program, or PAT-VP, began 4 years ago. 
PAT-VP offers transitioning servicemembers a 4-week program 
that blends classroom and hands-on training on the base at our 
training centers and off base. Upon graduation and separation 
from service, the PAT-VP places each graduate in an 
apprenticeship program, applies course credits, and finds them 
a job with one of our signatory contractors wherever they want 
to resettle in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Penski">The inaugural PAT-VP class at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in 
Washington State just graduated from their apprenticeship 
program a couple of weeks ago. We currently work with base 
staff to assist the recruitment and placement of transitioning 
soldiers into our PAT-VP. As the construction industry workers 
meet retirement age, we feel that the veteran community's skill 
set and attributes are a perfect fit for the aging workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Penski">Our expansion is limited by base access in a vibrant 
construction market where signatory contractors have long-term 
job opportunities. To accelerate our placement of veterans, we 
also need access to our National Guard and Reserve centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Penski">Benefits of on-the-job training and apprenticeship are 
available for veterans under the various VA educational 
assistance programs. Utilization of the post-9/11 GI Bill 
benefits vary from apprentice to apprentice. These decisions 
depend on the apprenticeship program they choose and where they 
want to relocate. We encourage veterans who enter our 
apprenticeship program not to use their GI benefits if they 
don't have to. Our apprenticeship program is fully funded so 
their education is free. We advise veterans to use the GI 
benefits to pursue higher education. They may transfer earned 
credits from the apprenticeship program and continue their 
education outside of our training. Some vets use their GI 
benefits to offset housing costs and make up the difference in 
pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Penski">The needs of tomorrow's workforce require us to adjust to 
the rapid changes in the technology of our industry. This 
Committee should consider ways to strongly encourage the use of 
apprentices on Federal construction projects. As we know, this 
is the best way to increase apprenticeship opportunities. This, 
in turn, will increase the number of veterans placed in career 
paths in the construction industry.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Thank you, Mr. Penski.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Arrington">And thank all the witnesses for your testimony, for your 
time and input. It is an exciting opportunity to expand on and 
enhance a program that is working for our economy. It is 
working for our veterans. It is working for companies like 
Charter Communications. And so let's figure out together how we 
can make it easier for veterans and promote this opportunity to 
veterans so they can avail themselves of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I am going to reserve my time and let my colleagues ask 
questions, and I will--I have several, and if they don't ask 
them, I will get to them here at the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    Mr. Takano, I recognize you now for 5 minutes of questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Takano">Thank you, sir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Takano">First of all, let me welcome you all here and thank you all 
for testifying today. I wanted to--where is that question I was 
looking for? General Worley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Takano">General Worley, do we have any data or data on the number 
of veterans using the GI Bill for on-the-job training or about 
which employers are receiving the most GI Bill on-the-job 
training? Do we have any of that data?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Takano">    General Worley. In fiscal year 2017, we have by our records 
about 30,000 individuals in OJT and apprenticeship programs, 
and I will use this together because OJT apprenticeships are 
very similar programs. And I don't, off the top of my head--I 
cannot tell you whether more of them are in one particular 
skill set or another. We can--I can take that for the record, 
Congressman, if you would like me to, but the number of 
individuals or beneficiaries so far this year is about 30,000.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Takano">Okay. Do we know who are the top employers
using the GI Bill for OJT?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Takano">    General Worley. I don't have that information with me, sir. 
I am not sure if NASAA might have some of that data, but we can 
take that for the record.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Takano">Okay. Thank you. We will look forward to that
information. Will there be any earnings data or outcomes data 
on veterans who use on-the-job training?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Takano">General Worley. One of the recommendations in the GAO 
study, as the Chairman pointed out, was focused on outcome 
measures. If I could just take a minute: There were three 
recommendations with the GAO report. The first had to do with 
outreach and publicizing these programs. This is done in a 
number of ways, as I mentioned in my testimony, there are a 
number of ways that we have been doing that through the 
Transition Assistance Program, through our over 50 different 
outreach events that we supported, social media, website, the 
guide that we published for employers who are potentially 
pursuing these kinds of programs. That recommendation has been 
closed out by the GAO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Takano">The second recommendation had to do with getting out of the 
fax business and the paper side of submitting the monthly 
certifications that apprentices and OJT folks have to submit 
through their employers. I am happy to report that we have made 
progress in that regard. We are not where we want to be, but we 
have made progress in that regard. The initial enrollment of 
someone in an OJT is now very similar to the initial enrollment 
of anyone else going to an IHL through our VA-ONCE system. So 
that information--that person can be loaded into our system and 
have that done electronically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Takano">The monthly certification of the work hours by which they 
are paid will be in VA-ONCE by the end of this year. So that 
development has been underway and will be in VA-ONCE. In the 
meantime, that information can be submitted through our Ask A 
Question capability on the GI Bill website, and that in fact is 
being used quite significantly now by employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Takano">    The third, as you mentioned, Congressman Takano, has to do 
with outcome measures. We are working to be able to get that 
data. We don't have it today. Both the completion of OJT and 
apprenticeships is one data point that we want to have as well 
and, more importantly, the information about employment. That 
is still a work in progress for us, along with all the other 
outcome measures we are using.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Takano"> Okay. Dr. Wescott, you mentioned something in
your testimony about marketing, and I was not listening as 
carefully as I should have been. But are there restrictions on 
being able to get marketing to inform veterans about this these 
programs, and is there a prohibition or just not funding for 
it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Wescott"> Well, certainly, we are very pleased with our
increase in funding, but there is no line item in the contract 
as it now stands for outreach and marketing. So, if we are able 
to--one of the things that we will do in marketing as we are 
out on a visit and we have time, we might add a stop to a--even 
if we are at a school, we could potentially, again, if time 
allowed, stop at an employer, potential employer, and talk 
about this program. But any funding that would go to support 
marketing has to be tied to travel. So that is one of our 
concerns, is we would like to see that code rewritten so there 
would be a line item for marketing and outreach so that we 
could pay for advertising, pamphleting, things that wouldn't 
necessarily be associated with marketing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Takano"> So there is no prohibition--there is
prohibition, but there is no funding?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Wescott"> There is--the problem is that there is no line
item to provide for it. It is more like a prohibition.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Takano">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Takano">Thank you, Dr. Wescott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Takano">    I am sorry I went over my time, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Thank you. The gentleman yields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    And I now recognize Mr. Bilarakis. for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilarakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.
And thanks for deferring to us and reserving your time, I 
really appreciate that very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">And I also appreciate the testimony today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">I have one--I have a question for the general with regard 
to the GI Bill and the housing allowance. I understand that the 
current law is that you have to go to a brick-and-mortar school 
maybe full time--you can correct me if I am wrong--to get the 
housing allowance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">Now, there are a lot of veterans, some who are disabled and 
aren't able to take classes at a brick and mortar, or let's say 
it is very inconvenient for them to get to a brick-and-mortar 
school, or it interferes with their work schedule. But there 
are now, you know, you have--of course, we cracked down on the 
fly-by-night schools, but now we have a lot of online schools. 
Of course, the brick-and-mortar schools offer online as well, 
so very credible online schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">Are there any exceptions that we can make for a disabled 
veterans or one that--if you have PTS or what have you, and you 
would like to get your education at home, and still receive the 
housing allowance, are there any exceptions that can be made, 
or do we need to change the law?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">General Worley. Absolutely. The way it works today--and 
this was changed with Public Law 111-377. That was enacted in 
2011. And what that did was, for those taking classes online, 
they do get housing allowance at one-half, 50 percent, of the 
national average. So if you are a full time, online student, 
you will get BAH at that rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">    Now, if you take some of your classes by correspondence or 
online and take some in residence, then your housing allowance 
will be based on the school ZIP Code, the facility code that 
you are going to. So it would be more than--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilarakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">You would get the full allowance if you take
half the courses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">    General Worley. Depending on your benefit level.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilarakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">How do you justify only 50 percent
reimbursement, you know, where they still have to pay--if the 
housing allowance is to pay for your mortgage, what have you, 
or your bills, because you aren't able to work full time, what 
have you, why not get the full allowance?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">    General Worley. To increase that, that would require 
legislation, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilarakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">All right. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">The next question is for Mr. Marchand. I hope I pronounced 
that right. I am very familiar with Charter's infrastructure, 
being from the State of Florida. And I know you all do a lot of 
good in the community and help veterans. Your investments 
coupled with nearly 12,000 veterans who make up your workforce 
help local economies and tie you to communities you serve. And 
I want to thank Mr. Penski as well, again, for hiring our true 
heroes, and they are the best workers because they are 
dedicated; they have the work ethic and the integrity. So I 
appreciate that very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">    Can you expand on your apprenticeship program for veterans 
and whether it is or will be implemented in Florida, as Florida 
is among the most veteran-friendly State, and we have about 2 
million veterans in Florida--in the State of Florida? Sir, can 
you expand on that--on the apprenticeship program?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> Absolutely. Thank you. And, yes, Florida is a
very important State for our--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> Can you push your talk button over there?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> It was talk. Is that better?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Sorry about that. Thank you. The State of
Florida is a very important state in our footprint, as you 
know, and we recently were helping and continue to help recover 
from the hurricanes that have gone through that area. So we 
appreciate the partnership we have had with the state 
legislators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Marchand">    Currently, it is not offered in the State of Florida, but 
it is a state that we are working to roll out the 
apprenticeship program to. We are currently in five states, 
Missouri Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas, 
and our intent is to go after all states that we have our 
business operations in, which would be 41 total states. Some of 
the states that we are going to go after require us to have 
national Department of Labor certification, and some states are 
going to require individual state by state applications and 
processes. So Florida is absolutely in our focus area and will 
be part of where we go next.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilarakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">Thank you very much. This question, again,
is for you, sir, and also Mr. Penski, if he wants to talk as 
well on this subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis">    Are there particular skills that veterans have that make 
them more attractive to an employer like Charter or to the 
Painters Union, what have you? Let's go ahead and start with 
you, sir, Mr. Marchand, and Mr. Penski, if you would like to 
respond as well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Marchand">You know, I think there is a wealth of skills
that veterans have that we have already addressed. You know, 
there is a tremendous amount of technical capability and 
expertise. They are very process orientated, clearly 
collaborative. I would also say that, beyond skills, there is a 
tremendous character. There is a work ethic and character that 
is unquestioned. They are dedicated. They are hard-working. 
They are resilient. They work through things like hurricanes 
with pride and with passion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Marchand">    So I think it is a combination of those two things, 
character and capability, that make them outstanding employees, 
and typically they stay a lot longer than our average 
employees. They retain in the company.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilarakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis"> I agree. Well, my time is expired, but, Mr.
Penski, can you briefly address that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Penski">Thank you. I would add a couple of more things.
Number one, they are mission orientated, and they will get the 
job done. And they are very team orientated, which is very 
important to the construction trades that we represent. Their 
safety is up to standards. And being a former Marine and 
looking at these veterans coming into our program, these 
veterans look out for each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Penski">    And in this apprenticeship program, it is another family 
for them coming, transitioning from the military into these 
apprenticeship programs and getting into our union. It is 
something that just energizes them and motivates them. They are 
there every day to go to work. They understand that making 
money for our employer is huge, and they do it. They do a great 
job.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilarakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis"> Thank you. And thank you for your service. I
am looking forward to you bringing the program to Florida.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Penski"> It is there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bilarakis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Bilarakis"> Mr. Marchand, Charter. Thank you very much,
again.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I want to thank the gentleman from Florida.
He yields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    And I want to recognize my friend from California, Mr. 
Correa, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Correa"> This is a most important hearing, very
important issue, and thank you gentleman for all you do for our 
veterans.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Penski"> You are welcome.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Correa">It is my opinion that the best thing you can do
for a veteran when they come back stateside is to get them a 
job, getting a good middle class job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Correa">And, gentlemen, last week, I was in Los Angeles. I ran into 
the chancellor of the Los Angeles Community College District. 
We struck up on a discussion about construction, bonds issued 
in LA, and project labor agreements. They have a PLA in LA 
Community College. I asked them, I said: Do you have a local 
hiring requirement?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Correa">He said: Yes, we do. We have a local content in--veteran 
content requirement at 35 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Correa">And I said: So what percentage is now veteran and local?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Correa">He said: Fifty-five percent of all the employees LA 
Community College construction are at that level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Correa">In Orange County, a number of schools districts, a number 
of cities are moving in that direction as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Correa">The State of California is just embarking on a massive, 
massive brick-and-mortar construction project throughout the 
State of California. So you got what appears to be massive 
demands for trained folks in the construction industry. A lot 
of them also happen to be retiring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Correa">    And so the general question to all of you gentlemen is, I 
presume you have a plan to hook up with all these folks that 
are going to need all these trained workers. And given all the 
veterans that are coming back, I think we are looking at a gold 
mine if we can figure out how to connect all these veterans 
with all these new jobs that are about to explode, at least in 
the State of California, in my district.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Wescott"> Congressman, let me just say that, we in the
State Approving Agencies are excited about those opportunities. 
I can tell you from my perspective, because I also serve as the 
Executive Director of the North Carolina State Approving 
Agency, we just began working with this contract for 
apprenticeship and OJT this past year. One of the things that I 
did was I met with the president of the North Carolina 
Community College system to talk about how we could promote 
apprenticeships in conjunction with that system. We think there 
is a very real possibility of linking that outreach. I would 
also look forward to meeting with National Guard leadership in 
the State. And also--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Correa"> Thank you very much for that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Wescott"> Yes. So that, again, we could reach out to
these folks and make them aware of this extremely valuable 
program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Correa"> And if I--let me say that a lot of these folks
at the local level that are going to hire these construction 
folks would be more than happy, I am sure, to reach out and 
work with you, really not at very high cost of marketing and 
trying to get your message out there, but just trying to get 
those workers in the front door. I know millennials get a bad 
rap, but I think veterans at the same time get an excellent 
rap. So I think this is a tremendous opportunity to get our 
veterans employed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Wescott"> As a former infantryman, we are not afraid to
get our hands in the dirt. And, yes, we would look forward to 
working with those sectors as well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Correa">And I offer my office as well as a resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Correa">    Mr. Chairman, I yield the remaining of my time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I thank the gentleman from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    I now recognize the distinguished gentleman from Florida, 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">And thank you, panel, I can tell you as a Representative 
from northeast Florida's Fourth Congressional District, which 
has a lot of military installations, and we have about 150,000 
retirees there in northeast Florida. This is really critical I 
think to the economic success of northeast Florida and, quite 
frankly, our country and does a great service to our veterans 
who have put so much on the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">I also want to say a special thank you to Charter and Mr. 
Marchand for the commitment. You know, we just suffered 
Hurricane Irma in the State, and it was devastating, to say the 
least. And I know your company really stepped up in the $1.3 
million help there, and we really appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">    So, Mr. Marchand, let me ask you this question. I was 
reading, and I think you mentioned also that you all are 
intending to hire, if I got the number right, 20,000 workers by 
2020. And can you explain how you intend to, I mean--you talk 
about a marketing nightmare--how are you going to achieve that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Well, first and foremost, we are doing that
because we have a number of our jobs that are located offshore, 
and our mission, our values, our company's operating 
philosophies to have those as American jobs in our American 
soil. And recently in McAllen, Texas, we opened up a 600-person 
call center to serve Spanish-speaking customers across the 
United States where previously that work was done outside of 
the footprint of the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Marchand">So it starts first with the mission of having service and 
resources to our customer base in the communities in which we 
serve. That is so critical. So, if you have a technician who is 
serving you locally and a call center that is serving you in a 
geographic footprint that is near you or a news station, an 
outlet, that is providing information to you locally, that is 
kind of who our company is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Marchand">    How we are going to do that, we have a well-oiled machine 
in terms of recruitment. We are actively sourcing candidates. 
We are actively using all means, whether it is anything from 
local like career fairs or connections with universities and 
colleges and trade schools, or it is the, you know--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"> So people can get an idea how critical
these positions that you are talking about are, can you talk a 
little bit about the benefits for those employers that come 
into that apprentice program?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Marchand">We have outstanding benefits. We provide
wonderful health and welfare benefits. We provide a wonderful 
401(k). We match at 6 percent. We have an additional 3 percent 
non-elective. So, even if you are not a participant in our 
401(k), we automatically enroll you in 3 percent so that you 
can start saving for long-term retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Marchand">    We have ability for you to go back to school at night, if 
you want to do that, if you don't have your undergrad or 
graduate degrees. So we have comprehensive benefits.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> And pay. And our intent is to sort of go out
and find talent that can be part of our future.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">These sound like great positions to raise a
family and create the whole American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">    Dr. Wescott, can you please talk a little bit about why you 
think we have had this drop in the number of approved OJT 
apprentice programs when so much is--you know, since 2011, it 
has actually gone down. And I noticed, when General Worley 
mentioned that you were going to be able to do some of this 
filing with VA-ONCE, you seemed excited about that. Is that 
going to help turn some of these numbers around, do you think?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Wescott">We would certainly hope so. And I am indeed
excited about that. And the fact that that could happen within 
the year will be a real plus, not only in us being able to 
attract what is going on in our States and where we have active 
apprenticeships, but then using that data and information to 
grow those apprenticeships. I think basically one of the 
reasons that our numbers went down--and, again, I want to thank 
this Committee and this Congress for increasing funding for 
SAAs. We were flat-funded for 10 years. And, of course, our 
expenses went up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Wescott">    Also, around 2011, we began helping the VA with their very 
important work with compliant surveys. So we added an 
additional mission as well. So, you know, if you have X number 
of folks and you shift your mission some, then it has to shift 
away from something. We are now excited at the possibility that 
with the increased funding with a renewed focus on 
apprenticeship and OJT, that we can really grow this sector. I, 
for one, am convinced that there are folks who just don't know 
about this benefit at the level which they need to.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"> Yep.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Wescott"> And we want to reach those people.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Rutherford"> Right. And that is why I was asking Mr.
Marchand. Put some of that out there about what kind of 
positions these really are. So thank you, Mr. Chairman, my time 
is up, and I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> The gentleman yields, and now I would
recognize Mr. Banks from the great State of Indiana.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Banks</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Banks">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Banks">    Mr. Penski, could you maybe dig deeper into an explanation 
of how the apprenticeship programs are funded and what portion 
of that funding comes from the Federal Government?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Penski">There is no funding from the Federal
Government. The funding for the IUPAT apprenticeship programs 
are collectively--they are contributions that are collectively 
bargained between both labor and management. So, each year, the 
IUPAT, the contributions may vary within the district council. 
We are broken into district councils. Those are the umbrellas 
under the IUPAT. So those are funded locally. All that training 
is funded locally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Penski">    On the international side, the Finishing Trades Institute, 
that is also funding off of per hour. And through that funding, 
grants go--training grants go down to our training centers 
throughout the IUPAT. In every area of the country, we have 
some very good training programs because of the economy, in 
large numbers. In other areas, we have smaller ones, so they 
get subsidized above and beyond through the Finishing Trades 
Institute or the IUPAT.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Banks</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Banks"> So funded entirely by dues-paying members?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Penski"> Correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Banks</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Banks"> And to expand on that. Can any veteran join an
apprenticeship program, or how do you select the veteran who 
would be able to participate as an apprentice?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Penski">Up at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, there is
consultation--it is getting into the TAP Office, explaining to 
the staff there and to the veterans what the programs are 
about. Then there will be one-on-one consultations, talking 
about the programs, talking about the benefits. Because--it is 
ironic because people hear Painters Union, and they think that 
is all that the program is about painters. Once they really 
understand that, as I said earlier, drywall finishers, glazers, 
so on and so forth, they may have a choice--a wider choice than 
to say what program I would like to get into.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Penski">    At that point, if it is through the base, and we end up 
doing a 4-week immersion program, then we will put those folks 
into the direct apprenticeship program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Banks</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Banks"> But how specifically are they selected?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Penski">Looking at their ASVAB, looking at their--
through their communication, through their interest in the 
programs, we found a little bit in the past where some of the 
veterans came into the TAP office, they wanted to get into the 
apprenticeship program, but it really wasn't for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Penski">Glazing, you can't be afraid of heights. Industrial 
painting, you can't be afraid of heights. So, once some of 
these veterans came in, they decided: Well, maybe I will look 
at another craft, or maybe I will go in a different direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Penski">So it is not for everybody. But the biggest thing that I 
think that the general president's vision is, it is 
opportunities, and it is opening the opportunities for our 
veterans to get into the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Penski">    One of the other methods we have is we have a Painters and 
Allied Trades veterans' website. And I get emails from veterans 
all the time inquiring about the IUPAT. It starts off with a 
few emails. And I will ask for a resume. Then it turns into 
some phone calls. And if this veteran says, you know, I want to 
go to Indianapolis. I will contact the training director there. 
Whatever trade they were looking at, I will walk them through 
all of the crafts that we represent, the timelines of the 
apprenticeship, the benefits that they receive from on-the-job 
learning to getting college credits for the courses they take, 
and the advancements beyond that. Then we will get them put 
into the program or the area that they select to go into.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Banks</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Banks">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Banks">General Worley, does the VA help counsel veterans and help 
them figure out whether an apprenticeship program might be 
better for them than a 4-year degree?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Banks">    General Worley. We don't. At least in education service, we 
do have the resources to counsel individually in the vocational 
rehabilitation area, which is not my lane. But there is 
counseling provided for disabled veterans for their education 
and employment efforts. So our work at having the consumers--
informed consumers is through the various media that I 
mentioned and outreach events and those types of things, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bates</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Bates">So it is a capacity--it is a funding issue to
allow you to give that good counsel, that good advice to 
veterans to help them choose one over the other?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Bates">    General Worley. Well, we have about a million beneficiaries 
a year using the GI Bill benefits that we have, so that is a 
big task to be able to counsel each one of them, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Banks</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Banks"> Thank you. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Arrington">The gentleman yields. And now I will yield
myself 5 minutes. And following on some of these questions--and 
then we may have a second round for those who want to stay. And 
I know Mr. Takano has some follow-up questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Arrington">General Worley, I apologize for not saying General Worley. 
You earned that title, and thank you for your service. This 
notion of a monthly certification by the recipient participant 
in the program and the institution or the company seems a 
little onerous to me. It seems like you could do a semiannual, 
maybe even annual with audits, sort of signed off on by both 
the institution, so you got accountability on both ends, but 
sort of just sample the population and audits, save some money 
there. That was just the first thing that came to mind when I 
was asking--learning about the program and asking questions 
with my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Arrington">So any thoughts about that? So there is not a monthly 
paperwork issue?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Arrington">General Worley. Mr. Chairman, the purpose of the monthly 
certification, and maybe certification is the wrong term, but 
it is to verify to the VA the number of hours that were worked 
so we can put that into the system and pay the beneficiary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    I think as we get better in terms of the technology, this 
will be very easy to do and very unburden some through the VA-
ONCE system. But, I mean, certainly, you know, you could do 
that less frequently, but, again, the purpose is to get those 
work hours and the rate--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Pay them per the amount of time they have
spent up to that point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    General Worley. Exactly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Arrington">So that makes sense. I appreciate that. And
then Ro Khanna, Representative Khanna is a good friend. And I 
am always encouraged when other Members outside of our 
Committee engage their veteran population and come to us with 
ideas on how to fix things and make them easier for our 
veterans and improve the quality of service, et cetera. So I 
really wanted to say, first of all, kudos to Mr. Khanna.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Arrington">And it sounds like a great idea to me that you have a 
company headquartered in X State that has a number of other 
States with a presence that they would be able to or you all 
would be able to safely, responsibly and appropriately certify 
them in a streamlined way in other States, maybe even just with 
one approval that is reciprocated throughout the number of 
States where they have a presence. I mean, common sense, 
doable, still safe, responsible for the veteran and all that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    Any comments, Dr. Wescott?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Wescott">Mr. Chairman, we indeed are very pleased at
this idea. We have been in conversations with the Congressman 
over the past several weeks about this. And when they first 
came to us, we talked with his team and then actually with him 
as well, and talked about how we could do this. It is an 
extension of what we are already doing in the distance learning 
area. It makes sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Wescott">We are making sure that we have the protections and, 
therefore, the veteran, you know, the State out of which this 
national apprenticeship is originating, we will make sure that 
it meets the required standards of the code. The veterans have 
protection. But then, you know, in the training sites where 
those veterans are working, you know, we won't necessarily need 
to be involved in the approval, but if there is an issue, State 
Approving Agencies within that State could address those as 
well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Wescott">    So, yes, sir, we are very pleased with the thought of this 
expansion and anything that will move this program forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Arrington">And let me just say--and I think it goes
without saying--I hope that you guys feel comfortable enough to 
talk to any one of us, but always look for those opportunities. 
I know that sometimes you can flex the policy to the maximum, 
but you run up against a legal barrier, and where it doesn't 
make sense, where technology can improve that or continue that 
in a responsible way. But where there is a legal barrier, 
please let us know so we can work with you to just make things 
better for everybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    I have got other questions. Let me ask my last one for this 
round to Mr. Marchand. Is that how you say it, Marchand?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> That works.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> Marchand?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> Better the second time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I am from west Texas. We, you know, French,
and--you know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Kudos to your company, to Charter and your ethos, your 
values for keeping jobs here--I know that is tough to do these 
days--and also for your commitment to the veteran community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    It seems like you guys have as much of an incentive to 
promote and raise the awareness of this program as the VA. I 
mean, you guys benefit. And what can we do to make it easier 
for you to engage at the right points in the process, whether 
it is on base, offsite? In whatever form or manner, how can we 
open up those opportunities so that you can do the job that all 
stakeholders need to be doing to make these guys aware of the 
program?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Sure. Thank you first for the compliment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Marchand">And I think there are a few things that have been said, but 
I will sort of repeat them. You know, awareness of the program 
is far paramount. You know, letting veterans know that this is 
something they can avail themselves to is so critical. I think 
we will do everything we can, but it has to be sort of a 
collective voice. Right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Marchand">I think awareness of the opportunity to other corporations, 
which is something as I was asked to come here today, was 
really a light bulb that went off that said, you know, what 
more can Charter do with our industry company partners and non-
industry company partners to make them aware of everything we 
are getting out of it that they could join in the cause? Right. 
So that is something I think we will try to take on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Marchand">Embracing digital, there is no question, if we can make 
things more streamlined and easier and more effective. This 
sort of concept of one pass for us across the country, since we 
operate in multiple States, will make it easier. We will do the 
hard work as the pioneering company. I am sure other companies 
behind us would benefit from, yeah, I operate in multiple 
states. Give me sort of the one DOL, sort of one pass, one 
approval to do this. Make it easy for the veteran themselves as 
they are going through it and the hours that they have to put 
in and all the paperwork they have to do. And, you know, I 
think embrace it as much as we have embraced the concept of 
simply hiring veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Marchand">You know, it is this conversation about not every veteran 
has to go to a 4-year institution. Joining companies and 
getting on-the-job work experience that we are committed to 
providing and other companies are committed to providing is a 
great route as well. A lot of times there is a pressure to say, 
okay, go to school, and that is not the answer for everybody. 
Certainly, at a certain life stage, it is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Marchand">    So I applaud everything that is being discussed, and we 
think there is a great opportunity.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Arrington">My time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    I now recognize Mr. Takano for another 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Takano">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Takano">    Mr. Marchand, tell me, how is your program--I imagine the 
company funds the apprenticeships. Is there any cost to the 
veteran to participate in this apprenticeship?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> There is no cost. We are fully funding both
the on-the-job training, we are paying their salaries. We are 
investing in future talent for our company.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Takano"> And you have various kinds of apprenticeships.
Do they lead to any kind of certifications?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> They lead to this broadband certification.
Yes, they lead to certification of being a technician.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Takano"> And does this certification only allow them to
work at Charter, or could they take that certification and work 
for any--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> It is transferrable.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Takano"> That is really amazing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> We are helping them be active workers in the
workforce in general. We will do everything to retain them, but 
if they choose to go, they can land other roles.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Takano"> And do you understand the distinction between a
registered apprenticeships versus an apprenticeship that is not 
registered? Is that a concept that is familiar to you?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Marchand</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Marchand"> You mean registered like--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Takano"> There is such a thing as registered
apprenticeships and not. Does the State Approving Agency 
understand what I am trying to talk about here? You might want 
to comment on that briefly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Wescott">I will be glad to, Congressman. Basically, of
course, registered, they have to go over to the Department of 
Labor or to the State departments of labor and register that 
apprenticeship. If for some reason they don't want to do that 
or do not wish to do that, then we can--we could work with them 
to develop an apprenticeship, a nonregistered apprenticeship, 
and then the veterans could use their benefits in that program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Wescott">    Obviously, if it meets the qualifications for a registered 
apprenticeship, we will always encourage them to engage with, 
you know, our State departments there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Takano">My understanding from counsel is that Charter's
apprenticeships are registered. The benefit of the registration 
is that there is the recognizable, they are a certification 
that is recognized. And hence, your apprentices, once they have 
completed the program, are able to work anywhere. That is an 
important thing to me, this distinction of registered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Takano">Some people think it is too cumbersome to get this done, 
but I think the due diligence is really of service to the 
veteran and anybody who participates in an apprenticeship. So I 
really congratulate Charter for doing that, for registering the 
apprenticeship and for offering that extra value. You are 
taking a risk, to some extent, of training somebody that could 
actually leave you and go someplace else. I doubly offer you 
kudos for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Takano">    Mr. Penski, a little bit more about the Project Labor 
Agreements and how they help apprentices. What I know about 
Project Labor Agreements is the negotiation that happens with 
an entity, a public entity. And what happens in these 
agreements is that a certain amount is set aside for 
apprentices and for veteran hire and local hire. Is that not 
correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Penski"> You are absolutely correct on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Takano"> And what I find remarkable in the question of
my colleague Mr. Banks is that no Federal dollars are involved 
in paying for these apprenticeships. And, again, is there any 
cost to the veteran or the apprentices to participate in your 
programs?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Penski"> There is no cost at all. It is all self-funded
through the IUPAT and the affiliates in the IUPAT.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Takano"> And is the IUPAT, like many other labor unions,
do they have training facilities? Do you have a training 
facility where you train your apprentices?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Penski"> Currently, I believe there are 107 multicraft
training centers throughout the IUPAT today.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Takano"> And who pays for those? Who pays for those
facilities? Who funds those facilities?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Penski"> Those are built by labor and management, their
contributions. In some cases, if there may be a government 
grant available for something through our government affairs 
departments, they may seek out grants. As a matter of fact, I 
believe right now there are three of our training--our district 
councils that are accredited through the COE, and we are 
working on the majority of our training centers to become 
accredited. So they are going to become colleges, self-funded.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Takano"> That is really quite remarkable. But the bulk
of the funding comes through these shared agreements between 
labor and management, the contributions?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Penski"> The majority of that money, yes, comes through
the collective bargaining agreements collectively bargained 
between labor and management.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Takano">I would love to find out how to visit one of
your training centers. I have visited some centers from other 
labor, but, in my estimation, no one does it better than the 
craft unions and the labor unions. So I congratulate the 
investment and commitment you have to your members and to 
apprentices and to our veterans. So thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Takano">    And my understanding is that these Project Labor Agreements 
are one of the few ways in which we can give preferences to 
local hires and to veterans and to actually build those 
preferences into those agreements.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Penski">You are absolutely right. And I think that is
probably the best avenue to make sure that we get these 
veterans onto these Project Labor Agreements in those local 
communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Penski">    And I just would like to add too, I mentioned earlier about 
the National Guard and the Reserve centers. Those folks live in 
those communities already. They spend in those communities. 
Their children go to school there. To invest in those veterans 
coming out of those National Guard centers locally and then 
putting them onto a project labor agreement is just a--is a 
total win-win. Not to take away from our veterans who may want 
to transition out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord or Andrews and 
move somewhere else, but investing locally in those veterans 
and putting them to work is phenomenal.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Takano"> Mr. Chairman, before I yield back, I just want
to say that in this Congress and in previous Congresses, I have 
noticed there has been a bipartisan majority that backs the 
concept of the Project Labor Agreements. And I am really 
pleased to know that members of your party and my party have 
joined together with the craft unions to protect that 
principle. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Thank you for your comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    The gentleman yields. And I now recognize Mr. Rutherford 
for another 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">I want to follow up on Mr. Takano's first question dealing 
with the registration of programs and the chartering of 
programs. I think, Mr. Wescott, when you responded, it sounded 
like it was either DOL can offer that certification or the 
State authorizing agency can do that or--well, you didn't get 
into this, but in the material it says or the VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">    So my question is, seems like we have three bodies here 
that you guys are having to suffer under for these 
certifications and regulations. You know, is there some way--
and it seems like the State authorizing agencies would be the 
place to go because they know the particular certifying 
requirements for licensing and things within their 
jurisdiction. Is it an and, or is it an or? It sounds like an 
and to me.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Wescott">I think both of us can speak to that. I will
speak to what I know of in North Carolina, because I have 
become remarkably acquainted with this sector having picked up 
this contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Wescott">It really is an and, and it works well as long as the 
liaison is there. And we have worked hard in North Carolina to 
make it work. We work very closely with our State office. So 
that if a business owner calls in, he is interested in setting 
up a program for veterans, an apprenticeship, we will then 
connect him with the State office so that they will work with 
him to set up a registered apprenticeship that will be 
available for all of his employees. And then if he has some of 
those employees that are veterans, he then sends them back to 
us, provides us--he or she sends them back to us, provides us 
with the information we need to then add a couple of documents 
in our office and work with him to explain how it will work 
with the GI Bill. And then we send that over to the VA, and 
they process that, give him a facility code, and he is now 
able, that veteran is now able to undertake his training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Wescott">    It is a smooth process, but certainly for the veteran, he 
gets a little--and I am proud of this--a little higher degree 
of protection and attention, because we are involved in there 
making sure that the employer is fully aware of what needs to 
be done.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">General?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">General Worley. Thank you. If I might add, think about it 
in a couple of different ways. DOL registered apprenticeships, 
the employer has to go through a certain, you know, set of 
requirements and meet certain criteria and standards to be a 
DOL registered apprenticeship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">    In the law, that is a deemed--from the GI Bill perspective, 
that is a deemed approved apprenticeship for GI Bill. So they 
don't have to reinvent the wheel when they go to the State 
Approving Agency. They have to provide a notification. There is 
a certifying official and an application and then the training 
package that they already had. So it is a streamlined process 
to get GI Bill approved, if you are already a DOL registered 
apprenticeship. If you are not a DOL registered apprenticeship, 
then the SAA has the responsibility and authority to review the 
training plan and make sure the wages are there and all of 
those things.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">So those are the employers that we are
hearing from, the ones that aren't in those already certified 
or registered programs that say they are double-working 
everything. Is that correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">    General Worley. There might be that complaint out there. I 
don't know. But there was a significant effort back in 2015 
that has progressed to today to try to streamline that process 
and reach out to DOL registered apprenticeship employers and 
let them know, if they didn't already know, that it is just a 
couple more steps to be a GI Bill approved apprenticeship.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rutherford</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">To kind of follow up on the offer by the
Chairman, if you would, if you think there is a need for a 
legislative fix to streamline that for those employers out 
there, let us know. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Rutherford">    I yield back my time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Arrington">The gentleman yields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    And the chair would offer any comments from Mr. Correa. Mr. 
Correa, if you have comments.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Correa"> Conclusion, or are we having the last round?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> No, we are going to keep going as long as
you have questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Correa">Very quickly, do we have, gentlemen, any
thoughts of following up on how veterans do after they finish 
your apprenticeship programs, a few years later to follow up to 
make sure that veterans are actually staying there, progressing 
in their careers, or maybe they need additional help to get 
over any of those invisible wounds they bring back from the 
theatres of war?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Correa">    General Worley. I will just respond to that by saying that 
we are working on outcome measures and employment. I am not 
sure about the longer term. Our initial effort is to find and 
track completion and employment, initial employment. But your 
point is well taken, Congressman, and we need to be looking 
long-term at that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Correa"> And if I may, ultimately, what we are doing
here is connected to the VA and services down the road. So I 
know it is a little bit hard to make the jump, but they are all 
connected ultimately. And just some food for thought into how 
we can maybe make that jump and make the system seamless for 
some of these veterans who a few years later find out that, 
again, these invisible wounds come to the front.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wescott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Wescott">You know, one of the things that State
Approving Agencies would like to do, Congressman--and thank you 
for that question--is, again, to focus more of our efforts in 
this area. We would like to make more visits to apprenticeship 
sites and able to talk with veterans at those sites and find 
out what is working, and also find out, while we are there on 
that visit, where there may be other opportunities that we can 
also reach out and make others aware of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Wescott">    So we do want--we are very much interested in not just the 
initial approval, but in following up on what is going on after 
that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Correa"> Mr. Chair, I yield the remainder of my time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Arrington">The gentleman yields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I yield myself 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Tracking results, outcomes is the key for us and for you 
all to know what is working and how we can improve on the 
programs or when we need to move on to another program that 
will work. And so I am always concerned when there is an issue 
with just collecting data, outcome data, or if the metrics are 
not the right metrics, they are inputs, not outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Arrington">And so, General, tell me what we are collecting now to know 
if this--intuitively, we believe it works. We have an example, 
a fine example here today, but we have got to look at the rest 
of the country, and we want to reward those people where the 
engagement is working and et cetera. What are you tracking now? 
What needs to be tracked? Give us kind of an update on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Arrington">General Worley. We have been working for some time broadly 
on outcome measures for the whole program. Those have been 
fairly traditional measures, graduation rates, certificate of 
completion, retention, persistence, those kinds of things. As I 
testified back in the hearing after the GAO report was 
published, we hadn't really focused much, and the report 
identified that, on OJT and apprenticeship results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Arrington">So as we have continued to work and refine these things, 
again, we have work underway with the Census Bureau to develop 
an MOU with them to help us look at employment. Data mining in 
our business is a challenge, we will be candid with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    So when we move the enrollment--now that we have moved the 
enrollment certification of OJTs and apprenticeships into the 
VA-ONCE system, which is what the schools use and the employers 
use now, we will be better able to track completion rates for 
OJTs and apprenticeships, because that will be right in our 
system. And then we will continue to work on, more importantly, 
did they get the job that they were OJTing for, as an 
apprentice for, either in that company or elsewhere. So it is 
still a work in progress, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Arrington">It seems, to your last point, you know, did
they get the job, and how have they progressed, and now that 
they have this certification that is transferrable, now they 
are more marketable. And so whether they are at the job where 
they completed the program and then beyond, it seems really 
straightforward to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Arrington">And I just--I would encourage you, because it has been 2 
years since the GAO report. I know how good you are and earnest 
you are to serve. These guys, these are your colleagues, but we 
cannot get excited about, I can't personally, unless I know 
something is working. And without data, you know, I can't say 
that they are all like Mr. Marchand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Arrington">So please expedite that so that when we have another 
discussion, you can tell us exactly how things are going in 
that regard and that we, in fact, are collecting data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Anything on the GAO front that you think is worth talking 
about in terms of what you believe is on the money and that you 
have already begun the process of implementing so we can make 
this a better program, other than the tracking and the 
education and promotion? Is there anything else?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    General Worley. Nothing else. As you know, there were three 
recommendations. Two of them are closed out.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I guess I should say anything beyond that
that you think we need to be doing?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    General Worley. Beyond that? Not at this point. I think 
mention has already been made of looking at ways to facilitate 
national approvals. And I think that would be very helpful, but 
nothing else beyond that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> I will yield any other time necessary for
final comments or questions. Mr. Takano?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Takano">Just briefly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Takano">    Mr. Penski, you looked like you wanted to say something 
earlier, and I don't think my colleague Mr. Correa saw you. Do 
you want to respond to something he said earlier?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> Did Mr. Correa have his glasses on?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Correa"> It does not help much these days.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> Go ahead, Mr. Penski.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Penski</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Penski">I just wanted to comment, you made mention of
our veterans who may be struggling from physical or mental 
scars or where are they later on in the program. This goes into 
tracking a little bit that the IUPAT does, but one of the 
things that I was getting antsy in my seat over was we are 
creating a veterans' mentoring program for our veterans coming 
into our training centers. It is no different than our VFWs or 
American Legions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Penski">These veterans, now they are carrying whatever they had 
from their time in service, and they are starting this new 
career into whatever trade it may be, getting into a union, 
meeting new brothers and sisters within the union. They have 
concerns and issues, and we need to mentor them along into the 
family of the organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Penski">But they also--what we are creating, and General President 
Rigmaiden is looking at this program. We have a mentoring 
program, but not for veterans at this point. Solid into a 
training program. But we want them to be able to sit and 
express issues that they had or frustrations that they might 
have had on a job site that might have just been ready to send 
them over an edge. So we are looking at that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Penski">Mr. Chairman, I do want to comment about the tracking. As 
these veterans come into the program and they make application, 
on their application it says apprentice. When they go through 
their training program and complete and become a journey 
worker, their status goes to journeyman. They receive their 
certificates from the Department of Labor of completion, and 
they have their certificate from the IUPAT, which is 
transferrable to any IUPAT craft within the IUPAT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Penski">So we know if they are being dropped. We know if they are 
being suspended. We can track it through our integrated 
management system through the IUPAT, which cycles up from our 
district councils. So this is really building--and our general 
president is very huge on requesting from me constantly about 
how many veterans are we hiring? Where are we with our veteran 
employment? Where are we with getting them through the system?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Penski">    So I just wanted to add to that, that under the direction 
of our general president, this is an issue that is very near 
and dear to him, because, again, we are bringing in new family 
members, and we want to make sure we are just not bringing them 
in and say, have a great life; bring them in and nurture them 
along throughout the process.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> Will the gentlemen gentleman yield? I just
want to say that is a--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Takano"> Of course, I will.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Thanks for bringing that up, because, again,
I don't care what the program is or what the hearing is about. 
It seems to me that that becomes my biggest frustration, is 
that I don't have any instrumentation to guide this thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    And so the fact that you guys are doing it, as the union, 
what can I say? Great job. And I would expect that the same 
attention to those metrics are applied to all parties sitting 
at the table so that we can, again, ascertain what is working, 
what is not, and how we can turn the dials to improve it. That 
is all we want to do. That is all you want to do. But without 
information, it makes it really hard. So great job.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Takano"> Mr. Chairman, just briefly as I wrap up.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Arrington"> Sure.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Takano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Takano">Thank you so much for this hearing. I share
your concerns about the metrics and the follow-up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Takano">And both of you, both Charter and the IUPAT, are great 
exemplars of how you track and you take care of your 
apprentices. And, Dr. Wescott, I hope that makes you more 
excited about trying to get this going some more, because if 
the metrics are good, we should really be doing all we can to 
get more apprentices. And I think this opportunity really isn't 
as well known among our veterans as it ought to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Takano">And, Mr. Chairman, I hope we can get together and figure 
out how, if it is funding a line item for more marketing, you 
know, I think there is a lot of value in getting people into 
the trades and getting people into tracks that aren't 
necessarily having to go to a 4-year university, at least not 
right away. And I think not only veterans, not only the veteran 
population, but our country is hungry for these kinds of 
opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Takano">    Now I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I want to thank the gentleman for his
comments, as well as Representative Correa, and our panelists 
for your time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Arrington">    Mr. Correa, last comments.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Correa">Mr. Chairman, if I may have a couple of closing
comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Correa">    I just wanted to reiterate again my thanks for your 
leadership on this issue, to our panelists for being here and 
doing the good work you do. And, Mr. Chairman, I just want to 
let you know that in my district, we do have a lot of veterans 
and they are not going to go to 4-year colleges. A lot of them 
just want to get that good-paying job to support their 
families. That is what this country owes them. I think through 
your leadership here, I think we can come up with some good 
common sense solutions to these challenges of giving our vets 
what they have earned, which is a good-paying job in this 
country. So look forward to continuing to work with you on 
these issues, sir.

    <speaker>Mr. Arrington</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Arrington">I heartily agree with my colleagues. I am
always a little nervous when I am getting so agreeable with 
these guys, but, you know, what can I say? Again, we want our 
veterans to succeed. There is a great need in this country and 
a gap in skills and a need for labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Arrington">And on this day when my colleagues and I on the other side 
of the aisle have been talking about making it easier for 
capital to flow efficiently to new investments and 
opportunities, to create higher wages through tax reform, and 
that is just one part of the productivity equation. The other 
is labor. And what better story than filling that labor need 
with our veterans, but they have to be trained and they have to 
have charter communications companies step up, and they have to 
have the leadership of the VA being vigilant to make it easy 
for charters and for the veterans. So there is not a doubt in 
my mind that every one of us here involved in this discussion 
wants that to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Arrington">A lot of these ideas I notice in my short time here will 
come with the folks on the front lines, the folks on the panel. 
So please, again, bring those ideas to us and don't be bashful 
and, again, especially when it is a bright line that you have a 
legal barrier. And I know we will work together in a bipartisan 
way to solve problems here. That is what we are all here for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Arrington">With that, I want to remind all Members that you have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend your remarks and include 
any extraneous material in the record of today's hearing. 
Hearing no objection, so ordered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Arrington">If there is nothing further, this hearing is adjourned.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Prepared Statement of Robert M. Worley II</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member O'Rourke, and Members 
of the Subcommittee. I am pleased to be here today to discuss the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) education benefits programs. My 
testimony will focus on VA's administration of apprenticeship training 
under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Arrington">The Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) was enacted with the passage of 
Public Law (P.L.) 110-252, effective August 1, 2009. Chapter 33 
provides eligible Veterans, Servicemembers, dependents, and survivors 
with educational assistance, generally in the form of tuition and fees, 
monthly housing allowance, and a stipend for books-and-supplies - all 
to assist these men and women in reaching their educational or 
vocational goals. P.L. 111-377, signed into law on January 4, 2011, 
amended the Post-9/11 GI Bill and expanded the benefits and access to 
programs available to eligible participants. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is 
the most utilized of VA's educational assistance programs.
Background on VA Apprenticeship Programs</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Apprenticeship programs are available for Veterans using their VA 
education benefits, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill. These programs 
allow Veterans to learn a trade or skill through training, while 
simultaneously earning a paycheck. A Veteran generally enters into a 
training contract for a specific period with an employer, and at the 
end of the training period the Veteran typically earns an 
apprenticeship program completion certificate and job certifications, 
in addition to ``journeyworker'' status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Arrington">Veterans pursuing apprenticeship training under the Post-9/11 GI 
Bill may also receive a monthly housing allowance in addition to their 
apprenticeship wages. The housing allowance is based on a percentage of 
the Department of Defense (DoD) Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for 
an E-5 with dependents (based on the location of the employer), payable 
at the rate of 100 percent during the first six months; 80 percent 
during the second six months; 60 percent during the third six months; 
40 percent during the fourth six months; and 20 percent during any 
remaining months of training. Participants may also receive up to $83 
per month for books and supplies.
Approval and Participation in VA Apprenticeship Programs</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Arrington">The law provides that VA may pay educational assistance to eligible 
Veterans and other individuals participating in approved training 
programs. Department of Labor (DOL) Registered Apprenticeships are 
``deemed approved,'' as are those approved by DOL or State 
Apprenticeship Agencies recognized by DOL, subject to the requirements 
in Section 3672(b)(2)(A)(iii) of Title 38 U.S.C., and unregistered 
apprenticeship programs may be approved as long as the criteria in 
section 3687 of title 38 U.S.C. are met. State Approving Agencies 
(SAAs) overseeing education and training programs for Veterans are 
responsible for approving most non-Federal apprenticeship programs in 
their respective states. Similarly, VA has authority to approve 
apprenticeship programs offered by Federal agencies, including DOL 
registered programs offered in multiple states by carriers directly 
engaged in interstate commerce.
Partnerships</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Arrington">VA works with SAAs to streamline and standardize the approval 
process for DOL Registered Apprenticeship programs. SAAs must utilize 
VA's standard application process for employers seeking GI Bill 
approval of DOL Registered Apprenticeship programs. VA also works 
closely with DOL staff to ensure Registered Apprenticeship sponsors 
understand the approval process for GI Bill benefits. This includes 
participating in teleconferences with employers, providing information 
as necessary, and sharing SAA contact information. In November 2015, VA 
developed and published an informational guide for employers offering, 
or considering offering, On-the-Job (OJT) or Apprenticeship training to 
Veterans and their beneficiaries. The guide can be found at https://
www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/docs/job--aids/OJT--APPInfoGuide.pdf. A 
second edition was published in July 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Arrington">VA continues to work with the National Association of State 
Approving Agencies (NASAA) to ensure SAAs are aware of participating 
employers that have received national approval as well as any pending 
approval concerns. There are some challenges in the approval process 
for employers because training, at times, is taking place in numerous 
states, and VA's regulations require that the State Approving Agency 
where the training takes place may approve the course for VA training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Arrington">To promote outreach to employers that had received registration and 
approval of their apprenticeship programs from DOL, VA requested that 
SAAs contact those employers in their states to ensure that the 
employers are aware of the advantages of GI Bill program approval for 
Veterans.
Outreach</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Arrington">VA promotes available apprenticeship opportunities through the use 
of various platforms and strategies. For example, VA leverages the 
Community Veteran Engagement Boards, and Office of Economic Opportunity 
personnel to engage in nation-wide awareness of the economic impact of 
apprenticeships. In addition to traditional approaches, VA is utilizing 
social media outlets to provide greater visibility and enhance the 
awareness of these programs.
