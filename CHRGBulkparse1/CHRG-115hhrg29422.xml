                              ----------                              
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:22 p.m., in 
room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Tom McClintock 
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives McClintock, Labrador, Tipton, 
Westerman, Bergman, Cheney, Gianforte; and Hanabusa.
    Also present: Representatives Simpson, Hurd, Johnson, 
Graves; and Huffman.
    Mr. McClintock. The Subcommittee on Federal Lands will come 
to order, and I apologize for our delayed convening, but votes 
summoned us on the Floor.
    We are here today to hear two bills. I would begin by 
asking unanimous consent that all Members on the witness list 
testifying on today's panel be allowed to sit with the 
Subcommittee, give their testimony, and participate on the 
hearing from the dais. That would be Mr. Hurd, Mr. Simpson, Mr. 
Johnson, Mr. Graves, and Mr. Huffman.
    Without objection.
    In addition, I would remind the Committee that under 
Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at hearings 
are limited to the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and Vice 
Chairman to allow us to hear from our witnesses. I would ask 
unanimous consent that all other Members' opening statements be 
made part of the hearing record if they are submitted to the 
Subcommittee Clerk by 5:00 p.m. today.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    I will now begin my opening statement.

    <option>             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
    Mr. McClintock. The Subcommittee meets today to hear 
testimony on two bills that seek to reduce the National Park 
Service's $11.6 billion deferred maintenance backlog.
    Two weeks ago, the Natural Resources Committee held an 
oversight hearing to explore the maintenance backlogs facing 
our Nation's public land management agencies. Last week, the 
Committee heard testimony from Secretary Zinke, and much of the 
conversation focused on finding a solution to the Department's 
maintenance backlog, the majority of which lies in the National 
Park Service.
    The Federal Lands Subcommittee has three principal goals: 
to restore public access to the public lands, to restore sound 
management to the public lands, and restore the Federal 
Government as a good neighbor to those communities most 
impacted by the Federal lands.
    Several years ago, I asked John Jervis, the Director of the 
National Park Service, whether, if he had a choice, would he 
put new dollars into land acquisition or into deferred 
maintenance. He chose maintenance. Instead, we have continued 
to add new holdings to the Federal estate, while continuing to 
neglect the land we already hold.
    Louie Gohmert, a few years ago, compared this policy to the 
town miser whose mansion has become a town eyesore while he 
spends all of his money buying up his neighbors' properties.
    We took these lands into trust for the American public's 
use, resort, and recreation. This responsibility requires 
active management, not benign neglect. Fortunately, our public 
lands, properly managed, also produce revenues that can and 
ought to be used for their perpetual restoration, management, 
and enhancement.
    Today, we will be discussing bills introduced by 
Congressman Simpson and Congressman Hurd seeking new funding 
sources for critical public lands infrastructure.
    H.R. 2584, the National Park Service Legacy Act, by 
Congressman Hurd, would provide direct financing for the high-
priority deferred maintenance needs of the National Park 
Service. The fund draws from 30 years of mineral revenues from 
2018 to 2047 not already allocated by law. Eighty percent of 
the fund will be used to repair assets, including historic 
structures, visitor facilities, trails, water and utility 
systems, and enhancing access, health and safety, and 
recreation. The other 20 percent will be used to restore 
transportation-related infrastructure such as roads, tunnels, 
and bridges. The bill also promotes public-private 
collaboration by incentivizing projects that have a private 
donation cost-share component.
    H.R. 5210, introduced by Congressman Simpson of Idaho would 
establish the National Park Restoration Fund. This bill 
provides mandatory funding to address the deferred maintenance 
backlog of the National Park Service. The new fund will receive 
50 percent of all energy production on Federal lands, including 
renewable energy, over the amounts already expected, that are 
not already allocated to other purposes. The program expires 
after 10 years, or sooner if it has received deposits of $18 
billion. This would assure that we are not adding to a deficit 
that now imperils all government responsibilities.
    I would like to thank our witnesses for appearing before 
the Subcommittee today and look forward to hearing their 
testimony.

                                 ______
    Mr. McClintock. I am now pleased to yield to the 
gentlelady, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Ms. 
Hanabusa.
</option>
    <option>               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF HAWAII
    Ms. Hanabusa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to say 
that I am pleased we are able to have this hearing on both of 
these proposals to address deferred maintenance at our national 
parks and public lands. Both bills propose strategies to 
finance deferred maintenance and infrastructure needs across 
the National Park System.
    As we heard from the Secretary last week, addressing 
deferred maintenance is a huge priority that requires a 
significant dedicated funding stream. National parks are more 
popular than ever. Annual visitation numbers continue to break 
records, with over 330 million visits last year alone, with 
visitors spending an estimated $18.4 billion in local gateway 
regions.
    Unfortunately, current funding and revenue streams have not 
been able to address the needs of aging assets and 
infrastructure.
    Our local superintendents are struggling to keep up with 
repairs and rehabilitation, due to shrinking appropriations and 
aging infrastructure. We see it in my home state of Hawaii, 
where there is nearly $12 million of deferred maintenance at 
Pearl Harbor alone, and $85 million at the Hawaii Volcanoes 
National Park.
    In 2016, the National Park Service celebrated its 
Centennial, which was an incredible milestone and reminder that 
many of our parks are old. In the same year, Chairman Bishop 
and Ranking Member Grijalva worked together to pass the 
National Park Service Centennial Act to celebrate the first 100 
years of national parks. That bill included new revenue streams 
to support visitor services and created programs to leverage 
private philanthropy.
    This was a great first step, but to paraphrase Chairman 
Bishop, we can't expect revenues from cake sales to cover the 
$11.6 billion backlog of deferred maintenance--$11.6 billion 
backlog. This is why I am an original co-sponsor of the 
National Park Service Legacy Act, with Representatives Hurd, 
Kilmer, and Reichert, and why I co-sponsored the National Park 
Restoration Act, introduced by Representatives Simpson and 
Schrader.
    If we all agree that addressing deferred maintenance at our 
parks and public lands is a priority, then we should be able to 
find a bipartisan solution that would allow the National Park 
Service adequate resources to seriously address its maintenance 
backlog.
    Our national parks are a public legacy, and it is our 
responsibility to ensure that they thrive for many generations 
to come. Of course, addressing deferred maintenance is just one 
piece of the puzzle. We must remember that sufficient resources 
are also provided for day-to-day operations and partnerships to 
ensure visitor satisfaction.
    With that, I look forward to today's discussion about the 
two proposals before us.
    I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. Chairman.

    <option>   Prepared Statement of the Hon. Colleen Hanabusa, Ranking Member, 
</option>
    <option>Subcommittee on Federal Lands</option>
    <option>    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to say that I'm pleased we 
are able to have this hearing on both of these proposals to address 
deferred maintenance at our national parks and public lands. Both bills 
propose strategies to finance deferred maintenance and infrastructure 
needs across the National Park System.
    As we heard from the Secretary last week, addressing deferred 
maintenance is a huge priority that requires a significant dedicated 
funding stream. National parks are more popular than ever--annual 
visitation numbers continue to break records, with over 330 million 
visits last year alone, with visitors spending an estimated $18.4 
billion in local gateway regions.
    Unfortunately, current funding and revenue streams have not been 
able to address the needs of aging assets and infrastructure.
    Our local superintendents are struggling to keep up with repairs 
and rehabilitation due to shrinking appropriations and aging 
infrastructure. We see it in my home state of Hawaii, where there is 
nearly $12 million of deferred maintenance at Pearl Harbor and $85 
million at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
    In 2016, the National Park Service celebrated its Centennial, which 
was an incredible milestone, and a reminder that many of our parks are 
old. In the same year, Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva 
worked together to pass the National Park Service Centennial Act to 
celebrate the first 100 years of national parks. That bill included new 
revenue streams to support visitor services and created programs to 
leverage private philanthropy.
    This was a great first step, but to paraphrase Chairman Bishop, we 
can't expect revenues from cake sales to cover the $11.6 billion 
backlog of deferred maintenance. This is why I am an original co-
sponsor of the National Park Service Legacy Act, with Representatives 
Hurd, Kilmer, and Reichert and why I co-sponsored the National Park 
Restoration Act, introduced by Representatives Simpson and Schrader.
    If we all agree that addressing deferred maintenance at our parks 
and public lands is a priority, then we should be able to find a 
bipartisan solution that would allow the National Park Service adequate 
resources to seriously address its maintenance backlog.
    Our national parks are a public legacy, and it is our 
responsibility to ensure that they thrive for many generations to come. 
Of course, addressing deferred maintenance is just one piece of the 
puzzle. We must remember that sufficient resources are also provided 
for day-to-day operations and partnerships to ensure visitor 
satisfaction.
    With that, I look forward to today's discussion about the two 
proposals before us and yield back the remainder of my time.
                                 ______
    Mr. McClintock. Great. Thank you very much. We will next 
proceed to Congressman Michael Simpson, who represents Idaho's 
2nd District for 5 minutes.
</option>
    <option>                CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF IDAHO
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairman McClintock. Let me begin 
by thanking you for allowing me to testify in front of your 
Subcommittee. Also, thank you to Ranking Member Hanabusa for 
co-sponsoring both this legislation and Congressman Hurd's 
legislation. You have an important job of overseeing our 
Federal lands, and it is vital that we care for them because 
they belong to all of us.
    Our national parks have long been thought of as America's 
best idea. In fact, they have other complimentary names, such 
as our crown jewels. But more than anything, they are ours. The 
parks belong to the American people, and we should care for 
them as our own.
    It is long past due that we discuss the backlog maintenance 
in our national parks. Growing up in eastern Idaho, it was a 
regular event to pack up the car each weekend and visit 
Yellowstone. It was easy to spend a day in the park and not 
have to wait in any lines.
    However, that was a different time. Today, Yellowstone has 
nearly 4 million annual visitors, and the backlog in 
maintenance is upwards of $500 million. As a member of the 
House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I can tell you that 
their annual appropriated budget of $2.9 billion for the entire 
agency simply won't be able to account for the $11.6 billion 
backlog in maintenance.
    To start the conversation toward solving this problem, I 
introduced the Lands Act to help pay for both backlog 
maintenance and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I was 
careful when writing the bill to not dip into the LWCF funds to 
pay for the backlog maintenance. That is an important concept 
that has guided this effort. I am pleased all of the bills we 
are considering today honor that promise, and I look forward to 
working with Chairman Bishop and this Subcommittee to address 
the LWCF, as well.
    Moving forward, I began working with Secretary Zinke, 
Senators Alexander and King, and Congressman Schrader on a 
proposal that we could all support to fix the parks, the 
National Park Restoration Act. This legislation uses 
unobligated revenues from all energy sources, including 
renewable energies, to pay for the backlog maintenance in 
national parks.
    The bill uses the exact same funding mechanism as popular 
programs like LWCF and the Historic Preservation Fund without 
compromising their revenues. It only draws on revenues that 
would be due to the Treasury.
    The bill is projected to raise over $6.8 billion over 10 
years, which would make a significant dent in the backlog 
maintenance. I am thankful to Congressman Hurd, Ranking Member 
Hanabusa, Congressman Garamendi, and Congressman Schrader for 
supporting this bill in an effort to fix our parks. As a 
supporter of the Bureau of Indian Education schools, I also 
look forward to addressing that critical need in this process, 
as Secretary Zinke has suggested.
    We are also considering the Legacy Act, introduced by 
Congressman Hurd. We all share the common goal of fixing this 
growing problem, and the Legacy Act is another positive 
addition to the conversation. I do not view these proposals as 
competing; they are complementary. They both use the same 
revenue source to pay for backlog maintenance, and both have 
bipartisan support.
    A key element to enacting policy in this environment is 
advocating for fiscally responsible legislation. The National 
Park Restoration Act does that by creating a baseline of 
projected energy revenue that must be exceeded before revenues 
could occur to the fund. This mechanism was put in place to 
control the costs associated with the bill, and is a 
fundamental component to winning support from the House, 
Senate, and Administration, a required step to become law.
    As a supporter of the national parks, LWCF, and other 
important programs that are critical to taking care of our 
public lands, I am asking that the members of the Committee 
examine the legislation for what it is, an honest effort to fix 
the parks. I don't want to pit any programs against each other, 
I simply want to focus our efforts on using the long-time 
practice of existing energy revenues to fix public lands. I 
think that if this Committee can look at the various proposals 
that have been made, they can take the best of each and get a 
bill that will be bipartisan and that we can all support.
    Thank you again, Chairman McClintock and Ranking Member 
Hanabusa, and I look forward to working with all advocates for 
our national parks to fix the backlog maintenance.

    Mr. McClintock. Great. Thank you.
    Now we will hear from Congressman Hurd, representing Texas' 
23rd District.
</option>
    <option>                    FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS
    Mr. Hurd. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member. As the 
Representative from the 23rd Congressional District of Texas, I 
have the distinct honor of advocating for eight incredible 
national parks. Our national parks are an integral part of the 
American experience, as we all know. And I have seen firsthand 
how the eight parks in my district, including Big Bend and the 
San Antonio missions, provide immeasurable cultural, 
environmental, and economic benefits.
    Each park's landscape has a unique story that allows us to 
understand our past, appreciate our present, and ensure they 
are all available in the future.
    For these parks to remain beautiful and accessible, we have 
a responsibility as a Nation to care for them and maintain 
them. The National Park Service was created just over 100 years 
ago to do just that. But unfortunately, NPS currently faces a 
nationwide backlog of more than $11 billion to repair roads, 
visitor facilities, trails, and other park structures--$147 
million of that backlogged maintenance is in Texas alone.
    I have seen how much of an impact this has on the 
maintenance of our parks, which is why I introduced the 
National Park Service Legacy Act of 2017 with my colleagues, 
including the distinguished Ranking Member from Hawaii, 
Representative Hanabusa. The bipartisan, bicameral bill would 
address the present backlog by distributing currently 
unassigned Federal mineral revenues back into a restoration 
fund. The funds can be used for overdue repairs so that our 
parks can remain beautiful and accessible for future 
generations of park-goers to enjoy.
    My bill demonstrates that the call for Congress to fix our 
aging parks is being heard, and has been endorsed by park 
champions like the National Parks Conservation Association, Pew 
Charitable Trusts, whom I would like to thank for being here 
today, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
    But our bill is not the only solution to this expanding and 
pervasive problem. My colleague and friend from the great state 
of Idaho has worked tirelessly on his bill, which, if enacted, 
would accomplish these same goals. I am tremendously supportive 
of the Chairman's efforts, and I strongly encourage my 
colleagues to support both my bill and Chairman Simpson's bill.
    I want to thank the Committee for allowing me to speak, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.

    <option>Prepared Statement of the Hon. Will Hurd, a Representative in Congress

                                 ______
    Mr. McClintock. Thank you.
    We will now hear from our four witnesses, and begin with 
Mr. P. Daniel Smith, Deputy Director of the National Park 
Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, who comes to us all 
the way from Washington, DC.
</option>
    <option>    SERVICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, WASHINGTON, DC
    Mr. Smith. Chairman McClintock, Ranking Member Hanabusa, 
and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
present the Department of the Interior's views on H.R. 2584, 
the National Park Service Legacy Act, and H.R. 5210, the 
National Park Restoration Act. I will summarize my testimony 
and submit my full statement for the record.
    The Department supports H.R. 5210, the National Park 
Restoration Act. We recommend amending the bill to make the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
Education eligible for funding that would be available through 
the bill's proposed National Park Restoration Fund. This would 
make the bill consistent with the President's Fiscal Year 2019 
budget proposal.
    We appreciate that H.R. 2584 seeks to accomplish the same 
goal of providing dedicated funding for the deferred 
maintenance backlog, but we believe that H.R. 5210 would be a 
better approach to addressing the problem.
    H.R. 5210 would establish a permanent treasury account 
called the National Park Restoration Fund. Energy development 
revenues from both renewable and conventional sources would be 
deposited into the fund. The fund would sunset after 10 years, 
or once it reaches its $18 billion cap, whichever happens 
first.
    H.R. 5210 protects established revenue-sharing payments to 
the states under the Mineral Leasing Act, the Gulf of Mexico 
Energy Security Act, and other statutes, as well as allocations 
made to other established funds such as the Reclamation Fund, 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and all other dedicated 
uses of onshore and offshore revenues. These existing uses 
would receive their funding before the Restoration Fund 
receives anything.
    The bill identifies total energy revenue collection 
thresholds for each of the next 10 years. If collections exceed 
those amounts, and after all existing obligations are met, half 
of the revenue above that baseline would go to the National 
Park Service maintenance backlog. The other half would go to 
the Treasury.
    The Restoration Fund would receive revenue from all energy 
development occurring on public lands and waters, unlike the 
LWCF and the Legacy Fund, which rely solely on mineral 
revenues. The Administration's all-of-the-above energy 
development strategy aligns with the funding mechanism for the 
Restoration Fund.
    H.R. 2584 would establish the National Park Legacy Fund 
from Federal mineral revenues. The bill requires 80 percent of 
funds to be used for building, utilities, and visitor 
facilities, and 20 percent to be used for transportation 
assets. Deposits would be made to the Legacy Fund from 2018 to 
2047, ranging from $50 million to $500 million per year.
    We believe H.R. 5210 holds greater potential for providing 
significant near-term funding than H.R. 2584 does. According to 
the Office of Management and Budget, the Public Lands 
Infrastructure Fund, which is the blueprint for H.R. 5210, 
would produce an estimated $6.8 billion in expenditures for 
deferred maintenance over the next 10 years, versus less than 
$2 billion in the next 10 years under H.R. 2584.
    Appropriated funds are the current primary source of 
funding for deferred maintenance. But as the Secretary noted 
last week in his budget hearings, we cannot rely solely on 
appropriated dollars to address this problem. The backlog of 
projects at our national parks limits access, lessens visitor 
experiences, impacts recreational opportunities, and 
compromises public health and safety. The networks of roads, 
trails, restrooms, water treatment systems, and visitor centers 
are aging and are exceeding the capacity of visitors they were 
designed to hold and support.
    In conclusion, I would like to reiterate a few key points 
regarding H.R. 5210.
    One, this bill does not interfere with GOMESA, LWCF, or any 
other dedicated funds.
    Two, nothing in this bill authorizes new areas for energy 
development, nor is there any proposal to increase energy 
production in our national parks.
    Three, this bill is not an incentive to develop more 
energy. The Administration remains very clear that it supports 
American energy dominance. The question before us today is how 
we come together to reinvest revenues back into our public 
lands.
    We greatly appreciate the efforts of Chairman Bishop and 
this Subcommittee for today's hearing. We also thank Chairman 
Simpson and Ranking Member Hanabusa and all of your House and 
Senate colleagues for your support of H.R. 5210. The 
Administration looks forward to continuing the same bipartisan, 
bicameral approach as we move forward.
    Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement. I look forward 
to answering any questions.

    <option> Prepared Statement of P. Daniel Smith, Deputy Director, National Park 
  Service, U.S. Department of the Interior on H.R. 5210 and H.R. 2584
    Chairman McClintock, Ranking Member Hanabusa, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department 
of the Interior's views on H.R. 2584, the National Park Service Legacy 
Act of 2017, and H.R. 5210, the National Park Restoration Act. My name 
is P. Daniel Smith and I serve as the Deputy Director of the National 
Park Service.
    The Department supports H.R. 5210, but recommends amending the bill 
to include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian 
Education for funding that would be available through the bill's 
proposed National Park Restoration Fund. Adding those two bureaus would 
make the bill consistent the President's FY 2019 budget proposal. In 
addition, we would like to work with the Committee on technical 
amendments to H.R. 5210. While we appreciate that H.R. 2584 seeks to 
accomplish the same goal of providing dedicated funding for the 
deferred maintenance backlog, we believe that H.R. 5210 would be a 
better approach to addressing the problem.
    H.R. 5210 would establish a separate account within the United 
States Treasury called the National Park Restoration Fund (Restoration 
Fund). The additional funding deposited in the Restoration Fund would 
help reduce the National Park Service's (NPS) $11.6 billion deferred 
maintenance backlog. Energy development revenues from renewable 
sources, as well as from conventional sources (oil, gas, and coal), 
would be deposited into the Restoration Fund. Once the Fund accumulates 
$18 billion or 10 years have passed, which ever happens first, deposits 
to the fund would cease.
    The National Park Restoration Act would not change or modify 
established revenue sharing payments to the states under the Mineral 
Leasing Act (MLA), the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) or 
other statutes, nor would it affect deposits to other established 
funds, such as the Reclamation Fund, the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund (LWCF), or other dedicated uses of onshore and offshore revenues. 
These existing uses would receive all of their dedicated funding before 
the Restoration Fund receives anything. The bill identifies total 
energy revenue collection thresholds for each of the next 10 years; if 
collections exceed those amounts and after all existing obligations are 
met, half of the revenue above that baseline that would otherwise be 
deposited as miscellaneous receipts would be deposited in the 
Restoration Fund to address the NPS maintenance backlog, and the other 
half would go to the Treasury for deficit reduction.
    The Restoration Fund would be available for use, without further 
appropriation or fiscal year limitations, for the high-priority 
deferred maintenance needs that support critical infrastructure and 
visitor services, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior and 
the Director of the National Park Service. Funding could not be used 
for the acquisition of land. The bill also requires annual updates and 
reporting to Congress on the projects funded each year.
    H.R. 2584 would establish the National Park Legacy Fund (Legacy 
Fund), a dedicated fund from Federal mineral revenues that would 
otherwise not be credited to other accounts, and would be available to 
the NPS to use for high priority deferred maintenance needs. The bill 
requires 80 percent of funds to be used for building, utilities, and 
visitor facilities and 20 percent to be used for transportation assets. 
The bill would provide deposits to the Legacy Fund from 2018 to 2047, 
ranging from $50 million in each of Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020, 
to $500 million in each of Fiscal Years 2027 through 2047.
    The Department appreciates the effort of all members who co-
sponsored H.R. 2584, and the Secretary believes it is important to work 
with anyone who is willing to tackle this important cause. However, the 
Department supports H.R. 5210, the National Park Restoration Act, 
because it is more closely aligned with the legislative proposal in the 
President's FY 2019 Budget.
    If H.R. 5210 is enacted, the Restoration Fund would receive revenue 
from all energy development occurring on public lands and waters, 
including alternative and renewable sources such as solar, wind, and 
geothermal, unlike the LWCF and the Legacy Fund, which rely solely on 
mineral revenues. The Administration's ``all-of-the-above'' energy 
development strategy aligns with H.R. 5210's funding mechanism for the 
Restoration Fund.
    We believe H.R. 5210 also holds greater potential for providing 
significant near-term funding than H.R. 2584 does. H.R. 5210 would 
generate up to $18 billion over the next 10 years, versus less than $2 
billion in the next 10 years generated under H.R. 2584. The 
Department's maintenance needs are immediate and we support the 
proposal that we believe would result in more funding and in a more 
immediate fashion. Of note, the President's Fiscal Year 2019 Budget 
assumed that its legislative fund proposal, which the sponsors used as 
a reference in drafting H.R. 5210, would also allow up to $18 billion 
over the next 10 years and would result in an estimated $6.8 billion in 
expenditures for repairs and improvements over the 10-year period.
    Appropriated funds are currently the primary source of funding for 
deferred maintenance. However, as Secretary Zinke indicated before the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we cannot rely on solely 
on appropriated dollars to address this problem. Without a dedicated 
funding source, the deferred maintenance backlog will continue to grow. 
The backlog of projects at our national parks limit access, impair 
visitor experiences and impact recreational opportunities. The network 
of roads, trails, restrooms, water treatment systems, drinking water, 
and visitor centers are aging and are exceeding a capacity they were 
often never designed to hold and support.
    The Administration appreciates Congress' effort to author 
legislation that follows the blueprint laid out in the FY 2019 Budget. 
Although not identical, of the two funds, the National Park Restoration 
Fund is the Administration's preferred proposal to addressing the $11.6 
billion maintenance backlog that the National Park Service faces.
    As Secretary Zinke said when announcing the FY 2019 budget, 
``President Trump is absolutely right to call for a robust 
infrastructure plan that rebuilds our national parks, refuges, and 
Indian schools, and I look forward to helping him deliver on that 
historic mission . . . This is not a Republican or Democrat issue, this 
is an American issue, and the President and I are ready to work with 
absolutely anyone in Congress who is willing to get the work done.''
    We greatly appreciate the effort of this Committee, Chairmen Bishop 
and Simpson, Congresswoman Hanabusa, Senator Alexander, Senator Portman 
and all your colleagues in Congress who have sought to craft real 
solutions to our maintenance backlog. The bills we are discussing today 
reflect a bipartisan, bicameral approach that the Administration 
believes is necessary to achieve our end goals. We look forward to 
continuing to work with each of you on this issue in a collaborative 
manner that preserves and maintains our national treasures for 
generations to come.
    Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to 
answer any questions you or other members of the Committee may have.

    Director, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior
                   Question Submitted by Rep. Bishop
    Question 1. Conservation Corps accomplish millions of dollars of 
important work on maintenance, infrastructure, recreation, and wildfire 
remediation that address the priorities of the Department of the 
Interior each year. This work requires a good faith understanding that 
the project development and financial agreement approval process will 
move forward in a timely fashion, in order to recruit and train 
Corpsmembers, field staff and buy supplies like trucks and chainsaws, 
tents and boots. This work is also often seasonal, meaning there's a 
short window when the work can be accomplished without further adding 
to the maintenance backlog.
    We understand there is a financial agreement review process in 
place for any project over $50,000 which has temporarily frozen nearly 
all of these projects around the country. Please share with the 
Committee what steps the Department is taking to ensure these projects 
will continue to meet Interior's needs, Corps won't have to turn away 
thousands of young adults and veterans this year, and the projects they 
have been developing with Interior will move forward in time to 
accomplish this work during the 2018 field season.
    Answer. The Department is committed to appropriately administering 
a grant and cooperative agreement program that distributed over $5.5 
billion of taxpayer money each year. Upon arriving at the Department, 
Secretary Zinke began a review of the Department's financial assistance 
programs, which included a review of the audits and investigation on 
these programs that have been conducted by the Department's Office of 
the Inspector General. To ensure the proper management and 
implementation of the Department's grants and cooperative agreements, 
the Department provided guidance to Bureaus to improve the process for 
managing discretionary financial assistance programs. With an eye on 
establishing a reasonable path forward--although minimum thresholds for 
review were initially set--the process for review is an evolving one.
    For Fiscal Year 2018 financial assistance obligations, final 
approval is required from the National Park Service (NPS) Deputy 
Director if the amount of proposed funding is under $50,000. If the 
amount is more than $50,000, the financial assistance agreement must be 
reviewed by the Senior Advisor to the Assistant Secretary Policy, 
Management, and Budget prior to award.
    In order to manage and expedite this process, the NPS established 
an internal online review system. Projects are submitted for review to 
a central database that tracks budget information, project objectives, 
and public benefits. NPS staff review each project to ensure that they 
meet Departmental and NPS priorities. Then, either the NPS Deputy 
Director or the Senior Advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Policy, 
Management, and Budget takes action on the project.
    The NPS has worked diligently to ensure that projects are 
internally reviewed and approved to allow sufficient time for funds to 
be obligated and for work to be accomplished during the 2018 field 
season.
                  Question Submitted by Rep. Grijalva
    Question 1. In H.R. 5210, the baseline for Fiscal Year 2019 is $8 
billion. In this year's budget, the Interior Department projects that 
in Fiscal Year 2019, we will collect just under $7.8 billion. So, if we 
collect $7.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2019 as expected, and the number in 
the bill for 2019 is $8 billion, no money would go to the National Park 
Restoration Fund in Fiscal Year 2019.
    However, in the budget, the Department projects $760 million going 
to the Fund in Fiscal Year 2019. Using the Depatiment's projections, no 
money would be going to fix National Park infrastructure, but then you 
also say you expect $760 million.
    How does the Department come up with that $760 million dollar 
estimate?
    Answer. The Department's budget proposal caps the funds that could 
be deposited into the Public Lands Infrastructure Fund at $18 billion. 
The budget estimated that there would be $8 billion in deposits and 
$6.8 billion in expenditures from the Fund over the course of that 10 
years. Importantly, because the deposited funds would be available 
without further appropriation, this fund would be consequential for 
facilities that currently must rely on annual appropriations to address 
the maintenance backlog at national parks, wildlife refuges and Bureau 
of Indian Education schools.
             Additional Information Provided for the Record
    Several questions were asked of Deputy Director Smith during the 
hearing that required follow-up information. That information is 
provided here.
Representative McClintock asked if the NPS was able to provide an 
answer to his question asked during the House Natural Resources 
Committee oversight hearing held on March 6, 2018, about regulations 
adding to the cost of deferred maintenance.
    Answer. The current estimated $11.6 billion NPS maintenance backlog 
reflects the labor and material costs associated with maintenance work 
that has been deferred for at least 1 year. The costs for completing 
National Environmental Policy Act and National Historic Preservation 
Act (NEPA/NHPA) compliance, planning, design, construction management 
services, and construction contingency are not included in the $11.6 
billion figure. These costs are developed at the project formulation 
stage and applied on a project-by-project basis.
    The deferred maintenance backlog estimate also does not include 
non-deferred maintenance costs. Most projects, however, include both 
deferred and non-deferred maintenance components. Correcting code 
deficiencies is an example of a non-deferred maintenance activity. The 
activity does not relate to the failure to perform scheduled 
maintenance (resulting in a deferral), but relates to upgrades needed 
to meet evolving code compliance.
    As an example, at Yosemite National Park, the Fiscal Year 2018 Line 
Item Construction (LIC) project to rehabilitate the Wawona Wastewater 
Treatment Plant includes both deferred maintenance and code compliance 
components. Much of the work involves constructing new systems needed 
to prevent effluent discharge in the Merced River as the state will no 
longer permit such discharge. The project's total net construction 
amount is $18.286 million, of which 20 percent is deferred maintenance. 
After construction contingency and construction management services are 
included, the Fiscal Year 2018 LIC project list is $21.578 million.
    As another example, at Mammoth Cave National Park, the Fiscal Year 
2018 LIC project to Reconstruct Unsafe Cave Trails has a net 
construction value of $11,775 million, of which 90 percent is deferred 
maintenance. The only non-deferred maintenance component relates to the 
addition of handrails, stairs, and ramps in some areas to enhance 
safety. After construction contingency and construction management 
services are included, the Fiscal Year 2018 LIC project list is $13,894 
million.
    The LIC program typically budgets 22 percent of the estimated net 
construction costs for compliance, and planning and design, which are 
ideally funded 1 to 2 years prior to the construction budget request. 
Because these costs are calculated for projects that combine deferred 
and non-deferred maintenance elements, we are not able to determine the 
portion of these costs that are associated only with the deferred 
maintenance components of NPS projects.
Representative Labrador asked for an example of compounding costs the 
longer a project is deferred.
    Answer. The longer that an asset's deferred maintenance goes 
unaddressed, the faster that asset will deteriorate. The industry 
standard facility backlog deterioration rate varies between 2 percent 
and 10 percent annually (http://bokcms.appa.org/pdfs/131-05281612.pdf). 
This deterioration causes the cost of repair to grow at an increasing 
rate each year. The following is a detailed example:
    Cantilever Structure--The ``Cantilever Structure'' on the Clara 
Barton Parkway (part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway) 
provides a good example of repair work that originally was less 
expensive and less complicated when the defect originally occurred. In 
2009, a large pothole (6' by 4') was found in the Cantilever 
structure's deck. At that time, the repair would have required closing 
that lane of the bridge and possibly the lanes of traffic below (part 
of the Westbound roadway overhangs the Eastbound roadway for 0.27 
miles; this is the ``cantilever''). NPS staff completed a temporary fix 
by filling the pothole, which maintained the safety of the public using 
the bridge. The more extensive and expensive fix was delayed for a 
number of reasons including the complexity of the long-term repair that 
was beyond the capability of the park's maintenance staff and a desire 
save costs by lumping the repair with a more extensive project planned 
for the Clara Barton Parkway which would reduce mobilization and 
demobilization costs.
    Currently, the pothole has grown both in area and in depth and now 
measures about 20' by 10'. The deterioration requires different 
materials to repair, including repairs to the steel reinforcing 
material, which is more expensive than concrete. In addition, the 
larger and deeper repair requires that the structure be supported from 
underneath (from the lower roadway) during work. The more extensive 
repair combined with the need to close more of the road for a longer 
time leads to an increase in workzone costs. The total project cost of 
this repair is now approximately $200,000, far more than it would have 
been if the pothole had been fully repaired at the time it was first 
discovered.
Representative Gianforte asked for prioritized deferred maintenance 
projects in Montana and inquired how fast work could begin on these 
projects.
    Answer. The table below shows the maintenance projects that are 
underway or planned for Fiscal Year 2018 and Fiscal Year 2019 that have 
a deferred maintenance component. These projects will begin either in 
2018 or 2019.

Representative Gianforte also asked about the percentages of energy 
development revenues that come from conventional energy sources (oil, 
gas, and coal), and from renewable energy sources.
    Answer. In Fiscal Year 2017, 98.7 percent of revenues were from 
conventional sources and 1.3 percent were from renewable sources.
                                 ______
    Mr. McClintock. Great. Thank you very much for your 
testimony.
    We next welcome Ms. Marcia Argust, Director of Restore 
America's Parks for the Pew Charitable Trusts, also in 
Washington, DC.
</option>
    <option>           THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS, WASHINGTON, DC
    Ms. Argust. Thank you. Chairman McClintock, Ranking Member 
Hanabusa, and members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the 
invitation to discuss two important legislative measures that 
seek to address the deferred maintenance issue within the 
National Park System. These measures are the National Park 
Service Legacy Act and the National Park Restoration Act. And I 
want to thank Representatives Hurd, Simpson, and Hanabusa for 
their support of these measures.
    Addressing the Park Service backlog and keeping it from 
escalating will require a bipartisan approach and 
collaboration. Bills introduced this Congress, the 
Administration's recognition of the need to resolve the 
maintenance backlog, and this hearing are signs that we are 
headed in the right direction, as well as the opening 
statements that we have heard here today.
    The National Park Service estimates that repairs at sites 
nationwide total $11.6 billion, based on 2017 data. As the 
Agency manages these sites, it is responsible for the care and 
operation of over 75,000 assets such as trails, roads, 
thousands of buildings and historic structures, battlefields, 
recreation amenities, and electrical and water systems.
    Aside from the Department of Defense, the Park Service is 
responsible for maintaining more assets than any other Federal 
agency. Over half of these assets have deferred maintenance. 
The reasons for this are aging infrastructure, visitation 
pressures, and inconsistent maintenance funding. Of the $11.6 
billion backlog, $8.8 billion is attributed to highest and 
high-priority assets, which are considered critical or very 
important to the operations and mission of a park site.
    Restoring our national parks is about much more than the 
physical integrity of a trail or a building. Restoring our 
parks is about preservation, access, and economics. In addition 
to documenting our Nation's history for future generations and 
providing visitors with access to recreation opportunities, 
parks are proven economic engines for rural and urban 
communities.
    I have submitted with my written testimony a list of almost 
3,000 organizations that support directing more resources to 
park maintenance. These groups include counties and cities, the 
state of California, the state of Louisiana, businesses, 
veterans, the tourism industry, conservation groups, unions, 
and infrastructure groups, among others.
    There are a number of important similarities between the 
Legacy Act and the Restoration Act that I would like to 
highlight. They both establish funds in the general Treasury to 
direct annual Federal funding to park repairs. They both 
prohibit funds from being used for land acquisition. They 
discourage funds from supplanting discretionary funding of Park 
Service maintenance needs. They use mineral revenues from 
energy development on Federal lands and waters as their revenue 
stream. Each contain provisions ensuring that monies going into 
their respective maintenance funds would not come from revenues 
obligated for other purposes under law, such as the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, the Historic Preservation Fund, or 
state funds. And the bills share a number of the same sponsors 
and co-sponsors.
    Pew endorses the National Park Service Legacy Act without 
reservation.
    We offer our support of the National Park Restoration Act 
with improvements. We would like to work with the bill's 
sponsors to implement the following modifications.
    A funding mechanism that reflects a specific annual dollar 
amount is needed, ensuring a consistent source of park 
maintenance funding. As currently written, the Restoration Act 
relies on a percentage figure that means annual intake will 
vary from year to year.
    We would also like to see the addition of language to 
ensure funding parity between transportation and non-
transportation assets.
    While not on the hearing docket today, Pew also endorses 
the Land Act authored by Representative Simpson. The 
legislation seeks to provide dedicated annual funding for 
maintenance needs within public land agencies and to provide 
dedicated funding for LWCF.
    We are committed to working with the sponsors of all of 
these bills to incorporate the best provisions of each into a 
final proposal that will provide significant reduction of the 
park's backlog. Thank you.

    <option>Prepared Statement of Marcia Argust, The Pew Charitable Trusts on H.R. 
                           5210 and H.R. 2584
    Chairman McClintock, Ranking Member Hanabusa, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to discuss dedicated Federal 
funding as a means to help address the multi-billion dollar maintenance 
needs within our National Park System. I also want to thank Chairman 
Bishop and Rep. Grijalva for their attention to the deferred 
maintenance backlog. I request that my full written statement and 
accompanying documents be submitted for the record.
    The Restore America's Parks campaign at The Pew Charitable Trusts 
seeks to conserve the natural and cultural assets of the National Park 
System by providing common-sense, long-term solutions to the deferred 
maintenance challenge facing the National Park Service (NPS).
   the deferred maintenance challenge within the national park system
    At present, NPS estimates that repairs at its more than 400 sites 
total $11.6 billion based on FY 2017 data [see Figure 1]. At these 
diverse sites--national parks, historic sites, national monuments, 
battlefields, seashores and lakeshores, national recreation areas--the 
agency is responsible for the care and operation of over 75,000 assets.
                                Figure 1
    .epsThese assets include over 12,000 miles of roads (over 5,000 of 
which are paved), nearly 1,500 bridges and 60 tunnels, 18,000 miles of 
trails, more than 28,000 buildings and historic structures, 
approximately 1,800 waste water systems, former military installations, 
parking lots, waterfronts, campgrounds, electrical and water systems, 
interpretive facilities, and iconic monuments and memorials.
    Aside from the Department of Defense, NPS maintains more assets 
than any other Federal agency. Over half of its 75,000 assets have 
deferred maintenance. ``Highest'' and ``high'' priority assets account 
for $8.8 billion (or 75 percent) of the $11.6 billion backlog [see 
Figure 2]. Highest priority assets are considered critical to the 
operations and mission of a park site while high priority assets are 
considered very important.
                                Figure 2
    .epsPew has completed a number of case studies that document the 
breadth of maintenance challenges plaguing our parks, along with a 
compilation of testimonials from local officials, community leaders, 
and businesses that depend on well-maintained, safe, and accessible 
parks to help sustain healthy local economies. The case studies and 
testimonials can be viewed on our webpage: http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/
research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2017/05/national-park-case-studies.
    Of specific note, Utah is known worldwide for its national parks 
units. They attracted over 14 million visits in 2016, which translated 
to $1 billion in direct spending in local communities, $1.5 billion in 
state economic output and over 17,000 jobs. Yet our national parks in 
Utah have maintenance needs totaling $266 million. Zion National Park, 
one of the most visited sites, needs $65 million worth of repairs, 
primarily for roads that provide access to park resources. The floor of 
the Valley Road that runs through Zion Canyon, the park's most popular 
destination, is now accessed only by shuttle or tour buses 9 months of 
the year. It was originally built to withstand the weight of cars, but 
its heavy use by larger vehicles caused almost $3 million in damage. 
Millions more are needed to fix roads to Zion's campgrounds and visitor 
centers, and their accompanying parking lots, bridges, and tunnels.
    In California, national park units drew nearly 42 million 
recreation visits in 2016, leading to $2 billion in direct spending in 
gateway communities, $2.9 billion in state economic output, and more 
than 28,000 jobs. Despite the proven economic benefits that parks 
provide to the state of California, they have a maintenance backlog 
estimated at $1.8 billion. Yosemite National Park alone has $582 
million in repairs, over $200 million of which is attributed to roads. 
But once visitors get out of their cars, they find walking, hiking, and 
biking trails are often in disrepair as well, including the historic 
Yosemite Bike Path. Yosemite's famed Mariposa Grove has been impacted 
by a 1930s water line system that was leaking chlorinated water into 
the grove at a rate of 39,500 gallons per day, affecting the growth and 
longevity of the mature sequoias. The area will reopen this summer, 
after being closed for several years to replace the waterline system 
and other restoration efforts done in partnership with the Yosemite 
Conservancy. Aging historic properties within the park have problems 
too, including the Ansel Adams Gallery, and account for over $100 
million repair needs.
                   the causes of deferred maintenance
    Due to aging facilities, strain on resources caused by increased 
visitation in certain park sites, and unreliable funding, NPS has been 
unable to keep pace with necessary infrastructure repairs.
    &lt;bullet&gt; Aging infrastructure: Our National Park System is over 100 
            years old and many park units are showing their age. 
            According to a December 2016 Government Accounting Office 
            (GAO) report, most of the NPS maintenance backlog is 
            attributed to older park sites, stating specifically that 
            ``about $10.5 billion in deferred maintenance was for park 
            units established more than 40 years ago.'' Most 
            infrastructures have a finite life span, due to factors 
            such as material longevity, weather, use, and design.
     Mirroring the infrastructure problems of both urban and rural 
            areas across the country, transportation needs comprise 
            more than half of the NPS maintenance backlog and represent 
            some of the most costly infrastructure projects, including 
            roads, tunnels, and bridges.
    &lt;bullet&gt; Rising visitation pressures: In addition to aging 
            infrastructure, the high level of visitors that many park 
            sites have been experiencing in recent years is placing 
            increasing pressures on resources that are often already 
            showing signs of deterioration.
    &lt;bullet&gt; Unreliable funding: Years of underfunding compound the 
            challenges of preserving the physical integrity of NPS 
            assets. From FY 2006-FY 2015, Federal funding for the 
            repair and rehabilitation, cyclic maintenance, and line-
            item construction portions of the NPS budget declined by 33 
            percent.
     The agency is typically $250-$320 million short of the $800 
            million it estimates it needs each year to maintain 
            transportation and non-transportation assets at existing 
            conditions. We greatly appreciate the increased allocations 
            Congress has provided for NPS maintenance accounts over the 
            past several years, but more consistent, reliable funding 
            is needed to close this recurring maintenance gap and start 
            reducing the large cumulative deficit.
              why we need to address deferred maintenance
    Accompanying this statement is a list of almost 3,000 organizations 
across the Nation that support directing more resources to fixing our 
parks. These groups--counties and cities, local officials, businesses, 
veterans, the hotel and restaurant industry, conservation groups, 
unions, the recreation industry, infrastructure groups, state tourism 
societies--recognize the importance of investing in park maintenance 
for the following reasons:
    &lt;bullet&gt; Restoring our parks preserves and documents our Nation's 
            history for future generations.
    &lt;bullet&gt; Parks are economic engines for rural and urban 
            communities. Based on FY 2016 records, 330 million park 
            visits translated to $18 billion in direct spending to 
            local communities and regions, generating nearly $35 
            billion in national economic output and 318,000 jobs. A Pew 
            study commissioned last year found that fully addressing 
            the national park backlog has the potential to create and 
            support more than 110,000 additional infrastructure-related 
            jobs nationwide: http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-
            analysis/blogs/compass-points/2017/12/01/job-creation-
            potential-if-we-restore-our-parks.
    &lt;bullet&gt; Safe and accessible roads, trails and facilities are 
            needed so visitors can access and enjoy park resources.
    &lt;bullet&gt; Investing in park maintenance provides a cost-savings, as 
            postponement of projects can lead to more costly and 
            extensive repairs.
                     dedicated funding legislation
    Drawing down and preventing the escalation of a multi-billion 
maintenance backlog that has accrued over decades requires multiple 
approaches. Pew's Restore America's Parks campaign is pursuing a range 
of solutions including dedicated annual Federal funding, continued 
robust annual appropriations funding, legislative and administrative 
policy reforms, increased opportunities for public-private 
partnerships, and leveraging technology to achieve efficiencies as well 
as help generate revenue.
    Of all of these avenues, dedicated annual funding is core to 
ensuring that the NPS can keep pace with priority repairs and keep 
deferred maintenance from escalating. When Congress established the 
Park Service over 100 years ago, it mandated the agency ``. . . to 
conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the 
wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such 
manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the 
enjoyment of future generations.'' Congress has a responsibility to 
ensure that NPS has adequate resources to fulfill the mission it gave 
the agency.
    Several bipartisan bills have been introduced this Congress to 
tackle the deferred maintenance challenge within our parks, 
specifically the National Park Service Legacy Act (H.R. 2584/S. 751) 
and the National Park Restoration Act (H.R. 5210/S. 2509). We applaud 
the sponsors and co-sponsors of all of these measures for their 
commitment to our national parks and for responding to the diverse 
voices across the Nation calling on Congress to fix our parks.
    There are a number of similarities between the Legacy Act and the 
Restoration Act. Each would establish a fund in the U.S. General 
Treasury to direct dedicated Federal funding each year to park 
maintenance needs. Both measures prohibit funds from being used for 
land acquisition and would discourage funds from replacing 
discretionary funding for NPS facility maintenance needs. The revenue 
stream for the Legacy Act and the Restoration Act would be royalties 
from energy development on Federal lands and waters that are paid into 
the General Treasury (it should be noted that the Restoration Act would 
also use revenues from renewables). Using revenues from energy 
development for mitigation purposes is not a new concept. The onshore 
and offshore mineral revenue system is an existing system set up 
decades ago under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and the Outer 
Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953. Both proposals contain language to 
ensure that monies going into the maintenance funds would not come from 
royalties payments that are obligated for other purposes under law 
(such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Historic 
Preservation Fund, and state funds). Additionally, the bills share a 
number of the same co-sponsors.
    Pew endorses the National Park Service Legacy Act, introduced by 
Senators Warner (D-VA) and Portman (R-OH) and Representatives Hurd (R-
TX), Reichert (R-WA), Kilmer (D-WA), and Hanabusa (D-HI), without 
reservation. In addition to the provisions outlined above, the 
legislation would provide that 80 percent of the fund be used for 
repairs to non-transportation assets (such as historic structures, 
visitor facilities, trails, water utility systems, and assets that 
impact disability access, health and safety, and recreation) and 20 
percent be used to restore transportation-related infrastructure such 
as roads, bridges, and tunnels. This breakdown is intended to ensure 
parity for non-transportation assets, as NPS receives some dedicated 
funding from the Highway Trust Fund to address transportation needs 
(though the annual amount is far from adequate). The Legacy Act would 
direct monies from the fund to ramp up over 30 years: $50,000,000 for 
the first 3 years, $150,000,000 for the next 3 years, and $250,000,000 
for the following 3 years, and $500,000,000 for each successive year. 
This consistent, reliable annual funding is critical and would allow 
for more planning and integration of projects, cost-effectiveness, and 
the ability to tackle complicated, larger-scale maintenance issues. The 
measure also contains a provision to encourage public-private 
collaboration by incentivizing projects that have a cost-share 
component.
    Pew offers support of the National Park Restoration Act, introduced 
by Representatives Simpson (R-ID) and Schrader (D-OR) and Senators 
Alexander (R-TN), King (I-ME), Heinrich (D-NM), Daines (R-MT), Gardner 
(R-CO), Tillis (R-NC), Moore Capitol (R-WV), Manchin (D-WV), with 
improvements. We would like to work with the bill sponsors to implement 
the following improvements:
    &lt;bullet&gt; Modification of the funding mechanism to reflect a 
            specific annual dollar amount, ensuring a consistent, 
            reliable source of park maintenance funding. A successful 
            dedicated funding measure must provide certain and robust 
            annual funding to effectively address long overdue park 
            repairs. As currently written, the Restoration Fund would 
            take in 50 percent of energy development revenues over a 
            baseline figure projected for each of 10 years. Reliance on 
            a percentage figure means that the annual intake will vary 
            from year to year.
    &lt;bullet&gt; Addition of language to ensure funding parity between 
            transportation and non-transportation assets.
    While not on the hearing docket today, Pew also endorses the Land 
and National Park Deferred Maintenance Act (H.R. 2863) authored by Rep. 
Simpson. The legislation seeks to provide dedicated annual funding for 
maintenance needs within public land agencies and to provide dedicated 
funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund over a 7-year period.
                               conclusion
    Deferred maintenance within our National Park System is a critical 
issue that needs to be addressed. It will require a bipartisan approach 
and collaboration. The bipartisan bills that have been introduced this 
Congress, the Administration's recognition of the need to resolve the 
maintenance backlog, and this hearing are signs that we're headed in 
the right direction. Pew is committed to working with the sponsors of 
all of the deferred maintenance measures to incorporate the best 
provisions of each into a final proposal that can be enacted and will 
provide a significant reduction to the national parks backlog.
    Thank you for your consideration of these views and for the 
Subcommittee's interest in addressing the maintenance backlog plaguing 
our national parks.

    Mr. McClintock. Thank you for your testimony.
    Next, we welcome Mr. Matt Lee-Ashley, Senior Fellow at the

    <option>               AMERICAN PROGRESS, WASHINGTON, DC
    Mr. Lee-Ashley. Thank you Chairman McClintock and Ranking 
Member Hanabusa for the opportunity to testify today. My name 
is Matt Lee-Ashley, I am a Senior Fellow at the Center for 
American Progress, where I focus on natural resources, 
conservation, and public lands policy.
    Today's hearing, which focuses on strengthening our 
investments in our national parks and public lands, could not 
be more timely. The immense challenges facing our public lands 
today include the rapid loss of natural areas and wildlife 
driven by development; climate change and other stressors; and 
the need to ensure that all our parks and public lands better 
reflect the history, cultures, and needs of all Americans.
    The two bills that the Committee is discussing today aim to 
address just one element of the many challenges facing our 
public lands: how to invest in and care for the physical, 
human-built infrastructure in our national parks, and only in 
our national parks.
    To be sure, this is a vital public policy priority, but it 
is a manageable problem if we keep three things in mind.
    First, the actual size of the deferred maintenance backlog. 
The Center for American Progress' review of the National Park 
Service's maintenance database found that if you strip out the 
projects that should be paid for by private hotels and 
restaurants that operate in the parks, and the road projects 
that should be addressed through the highway bill, the backlog 
is reduced by 50 percent.
    Further, only $1.3 billion is actually listed as ``critical 
systems deferred maintenance,'' and considered by the Agency as 
their highest priority for necessary maintenance. $1.3 billion 
is still a large number, but with smart budgeting, it is 
manageable.
    Second, we need balanced and comprehensive investment in 
all our public lands. In 2016, the U.S. Forest Service, the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land 
Management had a combined maintenance backlog approaching $8 
billion. The Trump administration's budget, meanwhile, proposes 
massive reductions in operation funding for all these agencies, 
including the elimination of 2,000 park rangers and 
professionals. Piecemeal investments to fix parking lots and 
potholes will not overcome the damage that would be done by the 
Trump administration's proposed budget cuts.
    And third, our investments in our great outdoors should 
come from predictable and sustainable funding sources, and not 
undermine the conservation values the National Park Service is 
obligated to protect. We are not a country that should have to 
allow mining in national monuments to pay for the bathrooms in 
our parks.
    The National Park Restoration Act, H.R. 5210, mirrors the 
Trump administration's Public Land Infrastructure Fund, which 
Secretary Zinke discussed last week when he appeared before 
this Committee. H.R. 5210 is burdened by many of the same 
policy shortcomings as the Administration's proposal. It would 
invest solely in the built infrastructure in the parks, roads, 
bathrooms, concessionaire facilities, but does not help the 
Park Service fulfill its mission of, for example, protecting a 
Civil War battlefield from being turned into a big box store, 
or creating a new access point for kids to go fishing.
    The bill also does not acknowledge the pressing needs of 
the other land management agencies.
    But the biggest shortcoming of H.R. 5210 is that there is 
no guarantee that even a single penny will flow to the fund. 
For the national parks to receive any benefit from this 
proposal, the Federal Government would have to collect more 
than $7.8 billion in energy revenues in 2018, a threshold that 
rises steadily to $9.4 billion by 2027. This is a dubious, 
speculative, and uncertain approach to infrastructure 
investment.
    The condition of our national parks under no circumstances 
should be dependent on the price of oil and the decisions of 
OPEC, on whether or not we drill in the Arctic refuge or near 
the coasts of Florida or North Carolina, or whether we permit a 
new coal mine near a national monument.
    The National Park Service Legacy Act of 2017, H.R. 2584, 
presents a more balanced and realistic approach. It would 
dedicate a portion of existing Federal energy revenues to 
national park maintenance projects, thus providing clear, 
certain, and stable investments through 2047. Under the bill, 
between 2018 and 2026, $1.35 billion would go to national park 
maintenance needs, which along with sensible annual 
appropriations, would fund the Agency's highest priority 
projects.
    Paired with sustained and balanced appropriations for the 
land management agencies and significant, permanent, and 
dedicated investments in conservation through the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund and other funding streams, H.R. 2584 
can contribute to sound public lands stewardship over the next 
several decades. Thank you.

    <option>   Prepared Statement of Matt Lee-Ashley, Senior Fellow, Center for 
              American Progress on H.R. 5210 and H.R. 2584
    Thank you, Chairman McClintock and Ranking Member Hanabusa, for the 
opportunity to testify on H.R. 5210, the National Park Restoration Act 
and H.R. 2584, The National Park Service Legacy Act of 2017.
    My name is Matt Lee-Ashley. I am a senior fellow at the Center for 
American Progress, where I focus on natural resources, conservation, 
and public lands policy. Previously, I served as deputy chief of staff 
and communications director for the U.S. Department of the Interior. I 
have also had the honor for working in the U.S. Senate for then-Senator 
Ken Salazar, on behalf of my home state of Colorado.
    When Congress passed the Organic Act that established the National 
Park Service in 1916, it directed the agency ``to conserve the scenery 
and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to 
provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means 
as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future 
generations.'' \1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    By its founding legislation, the National Park Service has a dual 
mission of protecting--unimpaired--the natural, cultural, and historic 
resources with which it is entrusted and helping Americans see and 
experience them. Conservation and enjoyment.
    Today's hearing, which focuses on strengthening our investments in 
our national parks and public lands, could not be more timely in light 
of the challenges we are experiencing in the stewardship of our natural 
and cultural resources and in protecting and expanding access to the 
great outdoors.
    This Committee well knows the conservation challenges facing our 
national parks, wildlife, and cultural and historic resources. To list 
a few:
    &lt;bullet&gt; We are losing our remaining wild places in the United 
            States at an alarming rate. Between 2001 and 2011 in the 
            West, we lost an average of one football field worth of 
            natural area every 2\1/2\ minutes.\2\

    Alongside the real and pressing conservation problems with which we 
are confronted, we are grappling with how to ensure that current and 
future generations of Americans have the opportunity to get outdoors 
and experience the natural, historic, and cultural wonders that belong 
to them. For example:
    &lt;bullet&gt; A growing population needs more ways and more places to 
            get outdoors. Case in point: our national parks welcomed 
            nearly 331 million visitors in 2016 and 2017--a record 
            level of visitation.\5\ This is wonderful news, but unless 
            we expand close-to-home recreation opportunities and 
            protect other deserving places, we are going to see more 
            and more crowding and pressure on our park system.

    &lt;bullet&gt; We need to be doing more to engage all Americans--from all 
            backgrounds and all walks of life--in our public lands. For 
            the National Park Service, that means protecting places 
            that help tell the story of all Americans. A recent Center 
            for Progress analysis found that only a small portion of 
            national park sites has a focus on communities of color and 
            traditionally under-represented communities. Only 9 of more 
            than 400 national park units, for example, have a primary 
            focus on the contributions of women to our history. Only 
            three have a primary focus on Asian-American history.\6\

    &lt;bullet&gt; As a result of checkerboard land ownership patterns in 
            some areas of the country, too many public lands are not 
            actually publicly accessible. According to one study, more 
            than 4 million acres of public lands in the West--an area 
            nearly twice the size of Yellowstone National Park--are off 
            limits to the public because visitors would have to cross 
            private land or because there are no legal entry points.\7\

    &lt;bullet&gt; Finally, to welcome visitors to our public lands, we need 
            to invest in the physical infrastructure that visitors need 
            and want, including roads, bathrooms, and campgrounds. But 
            we also need to support the rangers, law enforcement 
            personnel, scientists, and other professionals who help

            take care of the resources and who protect public safety.
               maintenance projects in the national parks
    The two bills that the Committee is discussing today aim to address 
just one element of the many challenges I mentioned: how to invest in 
and care for the physical, human-built infrastructure in our national 
parks.
    To be sure, this is a vital public policy priority, but, with the 
right approach and investments, it is a manageable problem.
    First, it is important to clarify the scale and scope of the 
problem we are trying to solve. The National Park Service reports that 
it has more than $11 billion in ``deferred maintenance'' needs.\8\ That 
staggering number has rightly caused widespread concern. Congress, 
however, should scrutinize this number carefully to understand the 
highest and most pressing needs and tailor solutions accordingly. 
Maintenance of roads, tunnels, and parking lots accounts for roughly 
half of that figure; the U.S. Department of Transportation and their 
Federal highway programs therefore play a critical role in addressing 
the backlog.\9\

Backlog: Frequently Asked Questions,'' Congressional Research Service,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A Center for American Progress review of the Park Service's 
``deferred maintenance'' database also found $389 million in projects 
on concessionaire-operated facilities in the parks. These are privately 
run, for-profit enterprises; these companies, not U.S. taxpayers, 
should be paying for the upkeep of the facilities they are using.
    Further, our review of the Park Service's database found that only 
$3.5 billion--less than 30 percent--of the National Park Service's 
$11.9 billion maintenance backlog is labeled as ``critical systems 
deferred maintenance.'' Of that, only $1.3 billion--or about 10 percent 
of the total backlog--is serious enough for the agency to consider it a 
priority for necessary maintenance.\10\ To be sure, $1.3 billion is a 
large number, but this understanding of the truly high priority 
maintenance needs should inform Congress' budgetary decisions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, the maintenance needs in our national parks should be 
assessed in the context of the maintenance needs on other public lands 
as well--in our national forests, wildlife refuges, and national 
conservation lands. Yes, national parks are remarkable places. But so 
many of our children's first experiences in the outdoors are at a 
campground in a national forest, visiting a national wildlife refuge on 
a school trip, or going fishing in one of the BLM's national 
conservation areas.
    The maintenance challenges at these other agencies are just as 
pressing as in the national parks. In 2016, the U.S. Forest Service 
estimated that it had $5.49 billion in maintenance needs, while the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated $1.4 billion and the BLM $810 
million.\11\

            national parks and at other land management agencies.
    &lt;bullet&gt; Requires for-profit entities operating on national parks 
            and public lands to pay for the maintenance costs 
            associated with the facilities they are using. Taxpayers 
            should not be subsidizing corporate hotel chains in the 
            national parks, for example.

            including through the protection of new parks and open 
            spaces, and by working toward a more inclusive system of 
            parks and public lands.
   the administration's ``public lands infrastructure fund'' proposal
    In his Fiscal Year 2019 budget request of Congress, the President 
has asked Congress to establish what it has labeled a ``Public Lands 
Infrastructure Fund.'' The proposal would use Federal energy and 
mineral revenues that are above current budget projections to help fund 
maintenance projects in the national parks.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In testimony to Congress last week, Secretary of the Interior Ryan 
Zinke said the proposal would generate up to $18 billion in funding for 
national parks and public lands. He stated that this would be the 
``largest investment in public lands infrastructure in our Nation's 
history.'' \13\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This claim is not factually accurate. President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps employed more than 3 million 
Americans in restoring, protecting, and creating infrastructure for our 
parks, forests, and public lands. Adjusted for inflation to 2018 
dollars, Congress invested $58 billion in America's public lands 
through the CCC, far more than is promised through the Administration's 
proposal.\14\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The problems with the Public Lands Infrastructure Fund, however, 
are not merely rhetorical. The Administration put forward its proposal 
for maintenance projects in the parks while simultaneously proposing to 
slash the National Park Service's overall budget by 7 percent and the 
Interior Department as a whole by 16 percent. This would result in the 
elimination of up to 2,000 park rangers.\15\ America's most effective 
conservation program, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, would be 
effectively eliminated. And the Administration is proposing to increase 
visitor fees at national parks, which would price many families out.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Furthermore, the financing mechanism for the Administration's 
``Public Lands Infrastructure Fund'' is highly speculative and, 
unfortunately, in conflict with the conservation mission of the 
National Park Service. The problem, simply put is this: in order for 
park bathrooms to get fixed, the Federal Government would have to start 
collecting a lot more money from oil, gas, and mining companies.
    The three scenarios under which the Federal Government could 
theoretically generate $18 billion in additional revenues over the next 
10 years from energy and mineral extraction on taxpayer-owned lands and 
waters are:
  A.  If oil, coal, or natural gas prices rise dramatically;
  B.  If Federal agencies increase royalty rates, rents, and bonus bids 
            it collects from energy extraction--or requires hardrock 
            mining companies to pay more than zero dollars for mining 
            taxpayer-owned resources; or
  C.  If the Administration sells off mining and drilling rights in 
            areas of America's public lands and oceans that are 
            currently considered too special to sacrifice, such as the 
            Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Atlantic, Pacific, and 
            Arctic coasts, on the doorstep of national monuments and 
            national parks, and in national forest watersheds that 
            supply drinking water to nearby communities.
    Each of these scenarios is either unlikely or undesirable. Funding 
for America's national parks should not be dependent on the price of 
oil and the decisions that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) makes. This Administration is also signaling its 
desire to reduce--not increase--royalty rates for energy extraction on 
Federal lands and waters. And we are not a country that should have to 
drill a national wildlife refuge or mine a national monument to be able 
to fix some potholes in national park roads.
    For these reasons, the Administration's promise that ``up to $18 
billion'' would flow to the Public Lands Infrastructure Fund is 
unrealistic and in conflict with America's conservation values.
                        h.r. 5210 and h.r. 2584
    The National Park Restoration Act (H.R. 5210), in its current form, 
mirrors the Trump administration's ``Public Lands Infrastructure Fund'' 
and is therefore burdened by many of the same policy shortcomings.
    The bill narrowly focuses on maintenance projects in the national 
parks and does not make needed investments in our national wildlife 
refuges, national forests, national monuments and other public lands. 
It would invest solely in the built infrastructure in the parks--roads, 
bathrooms, concessionaire facilities--but does not help the Park 
Service address the problems of inholdings, encroaching development, or 
threats to the natural resources it is protecting. In fact, it 
explicitly prohibits the National Park Service from using the funds to 
purchase land that might serve as a new trailhead or to save a former 
Civil War battlefield from being turned into a parking lot for a retail 
store.
    Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the current version of H.R. 5210 
is that there is no guarantee that any money will flow to the fund. For 
the national parks to receive any benefit from this proposal, the 
Federal Government would have to collect more than $7.8 billion in 
energy revenues in 2018--a threshold that rises steadily to $9.4 
billion by 2027. This is a speculative and uncertain approach to 
infrastructure investment. The condition of our national parks should 
under no circumstance be dependent on the price of oil, on whether or 
not we drill near the coasts of Florida or South Carolina, or whether 
we permit a new coal mine near a national monument.
    The National Park Service Legacy Act of 2017, H.R. 2584, presents a 
more balanced and realistic approach. It would dedicate a portion of 
existing Federal energy revenues to national park maintenance projects, 
thus providing clear, certain, and stable investments through 2047. 
Importantly, it also clarifies that the bill would not affect other 
existing commitments of energy revenues, including the share of energy 
revenues that goes to states, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and 
the Historic Preservation Fund. Under the bill, between 2018 and 2026, 
$1.35 billion would go to national park maintenance needs, which--along 
with sensible annual appropriations--would fund the agency's highest 
priority projects.
    Paired with significant investments in conservation through the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund, contributions from the Department of 
Transportation's Federal highway programs, appropriate franchise fees 
from private concessioners, and sustained and balanced investments in 
operations and maintenance of the U.S. Forest Service, BLM, and 
National Park Service, H.R. 2584 could help us lay a strong foundation 
for conservation and public lands stewardship for the next 50 years.
                               conclusion
    Congress was truly wise when it endowed the National Park Service 
with the twin missions of preserving America's treasures and providing 
for their enjoyment. Over the past 102 years, the National Park Service 
has proven that these two missions are co-dependent. To successfully 
preserve Yellowstone National Park, the Cesar Chavez National Monument, 
or the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom sites, the American 
public must be able to see, know, and learn about these places. And for 
American families to have a rewarding experience when they visit, our 
public lands must be healthy, our wildlife must be abundant, and our 
parks should reflect the rich diversity of our history, geography, 
cultures, and peoples.
    To be sure, we have periodically heard arguments for prioritizing 
public use over conservation in the national parks. These arguments, 
however, present a false choice. The maintenance needs in the national 
parks are no reason to eliminate or divert money from the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, to stop conserving at-risk places, to slow the 
restoration of wildlife habitat, to price American families out of 
parks, or to undercut the rangers and professionals who care for these 
places. For more than a century--through two world wars, the Great 
Depression, and plenty of moments of national trial--our country has 
steadily made America's best idea even better. We have done so by 
remaining faithful to Congress' original vision that our national parks 
are to be enjoyed and conserved.
    Thank you.

    Mr. McClintock. Our final witness is Ms. Callie Hoyt. She 
is Manager for Federal Affairs for the Motorcycle Industry 
Council. She has traveled here the farthest to be with us 
today. She has come all the way from Arlington, Virginia.

    Mr. McClintock. Welcome.

    <option>             INDUSTRY COUNCIL, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA
    Ms. Hoyt. Thank you. Chairman McClintock, Ranking Member 
Hanabusa, and members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the 
opportunity to appear before you today to share the views of 
the Motorcycle Industry Council and views of other outdoor 
recreation interests, on potential solutions to reduce the 
deferred maintenance and repair backlog of the Department of 
the Interior, as well as that of the U.S. Forest Service.
    The Motorcycle Industry Council is a not-for-profit, 
national trade association representing over 600 manufacturers, 
distributors, dealers, and retailers of motorcycles, scooters, 
motorcycle and ATV parts, accessories and related goods and 
services, and members of allied trades. Our member companies 
and their customers, over 50 million off-highway motorcycle, 
side-by-side, and all-terrain vehicle riders, many of whom 
recreate on Federal lands, are very concerned over the 
Department of the Interior's and the U.S. Forest Service's 
growing deferred maintenance backlogs.
    Roads, trails, campgrounds, water systems and more 
recreational infrastructure suffer from this accumulated 
problem that is negatively impacting visitor access, enjoyment, 
and safety on public lands for the rapidly growing community of 
outdoor recreation enthusiasts.
    In 2017, 330 million people visited the 417 National Park 
Service sites across the country. The National Park Service 
completed over 650 million in maintenance and repair work in 
Fiscal Year 2017, but aging facilities, high visitation, and 
resource constraints have kept the maintenance backlog between 
$11 billion and $12 billion since 2010.
    The National Park Legacy Restoration Fund and the National 
Park Restoration Act are significant efforts to overcome the 
National Park Service's $11.6 billion maintenance backlog, an 
amount that is nearly four times the Agency's annual 
appropriations. Directing Federal receipts associated with the 
sale of publicly-owned energy resources toward addressing the 
maintenance backlog creates an opportunity to make a strategic 
contribution to our national parks early in the second century 
of the National Park Service.
    Establishing a sustainable source of funding for rebuilding 
recreational infrastructure is an investment, not an expense. A 
recent report from the Department of Commerce's Bureau of 
Economic Analysis calculated the outdoor recreation industry's 
annual gross output to be $673 billion, surpassing other 
sectors such as agriculture, petroleum and coal, and computer 
and electronic products. The BEA report also determined that 
outdoor recreation makes up 2 percent of the U.S. GDP, and the 
outdoor recreation industry's GDP has increased an average of 
4.4 percent since 2012, significantly greater than the 3.6 
percent average increase in the overall U.S. GDP.
    The outdoor recreation economy is among our Nation's 
largest economic sectors, and public lands are the backbone of 
our industry. These measures you are considering today would be 
the largest investment the Nation has ever made in its national 
park system.
    National parks and other public lands and waters account 
for $45 billion in economic output and 396,000 jobs, 
nationwide. These public areas provide significant economic 
benefits, particularly for nearby rural communities. Ensuring 
maintenance of roads and trails is critical in many rural areas 
of the county that depend on those routes to provide access to 
important energy structures or infrastructure, connectivity for 
residents, and tourism.
    While the Park Service holds the largest share of the 
Interior Department's overall $16 billion maintenance backlog, 
it is important to shine a light on other land management 
agencies that are struggling to address mounting deferred 
maintenance backlogs from a lack of adequate resources. The 
Bureau of Land Management's total backlog is estimated at $810 
million, which has increased 65 percent over the past decade.
    It is important to note that the BLM is one of the few 
Federal agencies that brings in more revenue than it spends 
through timber harvesting, livestock grazing, recreation, and 
energy development. The U.S. Forest Service's $5.49 billion 
backlog interferes with the Agency's ability to provide access 
and safe passage on its more than 158,000 miles of trails. Due 
to growing visitor use and limited funding compounded by the 
rising costs of wildfire suppression and the associated 
decrease of nearly 40 percent in non-fire personnel, the Forest 
Service lacks capacity and resources for achieving a 
sustainable trail system.
    The Forest Service currently manages 192.9 million acres, 
and the BLM manages 248.3 million acres of public land and 
administers 700 million acres of Federal subsurface mineral 
estate throughout the Nation. Maintenance of Forest Service and 
BLM roads and trails is imperative because these two agencies 
maintain multiple-use missions that support a variety of 
activities and programs. Through this multiple use management 
model, the outdoor recreation industry thrives on Forest 
Service and BLM lands.
    To emphasize that point, more than 99 percent of BLM-
administered lands are available for recreation use with no 
fees. When one Forest Service or BLM road or trail goes out of 
service, it is indefinitely placed on the backlog and can 
negatively impact a number of outdoor recreational pursuits, 
energy development, livestock grazing, and timber harvesting.
    The MIC and our outdoor recreational business community 
partners urge the Committee and Administration to broaden this 
funding measure to include maintenance of roads and trails 
managed by the Forest Service and BLM in order to establish a 
comprehensive solution to our public lands management agencies' 
deferred maintenance backlogs.
    Thank you. That concludes my statement.
