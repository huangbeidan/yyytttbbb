HON. RICHARD M. NOLAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nolan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Nolan"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members of
the committee, and thank you for all the great work you have 
done.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> Turn your mic on, please.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nolan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Nolan">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, members
of the committee, for hearing from us, and thank you for all 
the great work that this committee has done for this country. 
Much appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Nolan">I wanted to just briefly talk about the Poe Lock at the Soo 
Narrows, and I am sure you are probably familiar with it, but I 
do want to remind you that about a year-and-a-half, 2 years 
ago, Homeland Security did a study, and they found that 13 
percent of the Nation's gross national product goes through the 
locks at the Soo Narrows, and that is how all the mining in 
business and agriculture and industry from Lake Superior gets 
into the Great Lakes and into the Saint Lawrence Seaway. 
Thirteen percent of Nation's gross national product goes 
through those locks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Nolan">And Homeland Security concluded, among other things, that 
if those locks failed us for any reason, it would throw the 
country into a great depression, put as many as 7 to 10 million 
people out of work, and countless businesses out of business, 
not just throughout the midwest, but as far west as California 
and as far east as New York, and as far south as Florida and 
Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Nolan">Why? Well, much of that product that goes through there is 
ore from the mines in Minnesota, Wisconsin; and they, of 
course, fuel the steel mills of the Great Lakes which, in turn, 
fund the--or supply the automobile industry and all the 
manufacturing and industries throughout the Great Lakes region. 
It is a very, very powerful part of our country. In fact, the 
study concluded that the economy of the Great Lakes, if it were 
a nation by itself, would be the fourth most powerful economic 
nation in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Nolan">So that is why we have military protection at the Soo Locks 
to protect us against some kind of, you know, terrorist or 
asymmetrical military attack. But the simple truth is, the 
locks are becoming very, very obsolete, and badly in need of 
repair. They are not large enough to accommodate the--today's 
most modern Lakers, the ships that haul so much of the grain 
and the iron ore, and they are badly and desperately in need of 
replacement. The price tag is enormous. It is estimated to be 
as much as $600 million to replace that Poe Lock, which is 
falling apart, and to create a redundancy and a support of lock 
to keep that commerce flowing throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Nolan">I want to applaud this committee for appropriating $1.35 
million to do a cost-and-feasibility analysis so that we could 
get on with repairing this critically important part of our 
national security and our national economy, but bring to the 
attention of the committee the profound need to begin the 
process of funding this new lock, which is so critical to our 
economy, so that we can protect ourselves, continue to protect 
ourselves from a military attack, from natural disaster, or 
something we are totally in control of which is protect 
ourselves against negligence, and not stepping up to do the 
kinds of replacements and repairs that are necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Nolan">So beyond that, Mr. Chairman, I won't take a whole lot of 
your time. I want to thank you for the work that you have done 
on invasive species as well. Up in my district in particular, 
we have the Mississippi watershed, we have the St. Louis 
watershed going into the Great Lakes, we have the Rainy Lake 
watershed going up into the boundary waters. We are water rich, 
and among other things, we need to protect that and protect 
ourselves from the multitude of invasive species that threaten 
the health of our fish and wildlife and waters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Nolan">So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Be glad to take any 
questions any of you might have, and thank you for the work 
that you do here. It is very important to our country, our 
economy, and I would hope that this could be part of President 
Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure plan. It certainly needs to 
be considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Nolan">    [The information follows:]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> Thank you, Congressman. Does any member have
any questions? Ms. Kaptur.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Kaptur"> You know I can't let this moment go by.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> I knew that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,
Representative Nolan. What an outstanding representative you 
are, including for the Great Lakes, and I just wanted to ask 
you: Obviously, I am a great supporter of the study that is--we 
have funded, but I wondered if you have been privy, as a 
representative from Duluth, of any engineering studies that may 
have been done by the private sector that talk about the future 
of the seaway as a modern seaway. It was built during the 
Eisenhower era. It is over a half century old now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">    In terms of the width of the locks, right now you mention 
in your testimony, 13 Lakers heavily involved in the steel 
industry hauling ore, but what would be the proper width? What 
would be the proper dimension of the seaway from your region on 
down all the way to Messina? Have you seen such an engineering 
study to modernize the seaway?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nolan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Nolan">Well, I have seen some of them. I can tell you
right now, that the Lakers are operating at only about 80 
percent of capacity just because there has not been enough 
money put into the necessary dredging programs, and the locks 
are not even capable of handling the larger Lakers or the next 
generation of Lakers, and this is costing our country, oh, my 
gosh, the estimates are, you know, up into the billions of 
economic growth and income to the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Nolan">    So I should know this, but is this committee responsible 
for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Nolan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Nolan">Well, that is what I thought, and you know, I
think there is a balance in there of about $7 billion, and we 
all applaud bipartisanship, and to be sure, we should. I must 
say, there are cases where bipartisanship is not necessarily so 
good, because I think both Democrats and Republicans have 
raided that fund for other purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Nolan">    So I would strongly urge the committee, when it comes to 
that Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, to see to it that more of 
those monies, which are paid for by the Lakers, that is a use 
tax, to maintain and upgrade the Great Lakes seaway system, 
which has just fallen terribly far behind, and I would strongly 
urge you to use your authority here to make sure that more of 
those Harbor Maintenance Trust Funds are dedicated to what they 
were established for, which is maintaining the Great Lakes 
seaway system. It is so vital to our economy and our well-being 
and the creation of good-paying jobs in this country.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I thank you for making that linkage, and also
just to say, in closing, that if you have recommendations of 
firms, of studies, of individuals on the engineering side that 
could meet with our Great Lakes task force and provide 
information to this committee, this subcommittee, I think I 
would be very appreciative of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We have our regular big meeting in May coming up, but I 
think we need have a vision of the seaway and where the locks 
you referenced fit. But there is a bigger vision that, I think, 
actually, this committee has not been apprised of and of 
options, and other places in the country are much better 
organized, speaking very frankly, in terms of a vision for how 
to modernize their coastal ports or their regional assets, and 
I think that we need stronger voices, and yours is one of 
those. So I would just urge you to help us pull together that 
information in a coherent manner, and I thank you very much for 
your testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence and the 
committee's indulgence.

    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Any other members have any question?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Yeah, and I appreciate your point now. I think it is about 
$9 billion that is in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. We 
haven't used it for anything else. We can't use it within our 
budget, which is kind of weird, because of budget rules and 
what it would do to our overall budget and stuff, so we have 
got to find a way around that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Simpson">    The Transportation Committee tried to do that last year and 
was kind of shot down on it, but we are working on it. That is 
something we still need to do, because you shouldn't be 
collecting a tax to address a need and just growing more and 
more money in that if you are not addressing the need. That is 
something this committee recognizes, and we need to get 
Congress to recognize that also. So I appreciate your 
testimony, and thank you for being here today.

HON. FRANCIS ROONEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rooney</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Rooney">Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee for giving me the opportunity to speak today about 
the Everglades as well as for all of the important things you 
have done in the past for the Everglades for so many important 
infrastructure projects in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Rooney">The Everglades and Lake Okeechobee watershed include 16 
counties and 164 cities. It has a $2 trillion economic impact 
on the State of Florida, and supports 55 percent, 1.3 trillion 
of the real estate value in Florida. For every dollar invested 
in the Everglades and Okeechobee watershed, $4 of economic 
benefits are produced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Rooney">Due to a century of development, the greater Everglades' 
ecosystem is now less than one-half of its original size. The 
rest of it is Miami and Ft. Lauderdale now, and Lake Okeechobee 
fills up six times faster than it can be drained, which results 
in massive discharges into the adjacent rivers and marshes, and 
sends untreated water down into them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Rooney">It also impacts the delicate balance of fresh and saline 
water in the ecosystem. The Comprehensive Everglades 
Restoration Plan, or CERP, seeks to restore the balance to 
these delicate ecosystems and reduce harmful discharges in the 
Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries and send clean water 
south into the marshes of the Everglades of Florida Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Rooney">CERP was created by the Congress in the State of Florida in 
2000. It includes 68 projects that will combine to create 
storage, treatment, and flow southward into the marshes of the 
Everglades; storage and treatment of water entering into Lake 
Okeechobee from the north, and you all have funded the 
Kissimmee restoration, which is a big part of that; and 
balancing of the flows to control salinity. CERP was set up to 
share the cost 50/50 between the State and the Federal 
Government, and as of December 2016, the State had expended 
about $2.2 billion, and the Federal Government had contributed 
about $1.26 billion, so it is a 63 to 37 percent split instead 
of 50/50, and so we think that the Federal Government has some 
catching up to do if we could get the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Rooney">In fact, there are three projects that were authorized way 
back in the 19--in the 2007 WRRDA bill, which are still 
incomplete, the site 1 impoundment over by Palm Beach in the 
Loxahatchee Wildlife Refuge, the Picayune Strand project in 
Collier County, and the Indian River Lagoon, or C-44, along the 
St. Lucie Canal. The cost to complete these three projects is 
$3.3 billion, most of which is centered in the C-44 basin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Rooney">Additionally, there are four projects from the 2014 WRRDA 
bill which have not been completed; the C-43 West Storage Basin 
in LaBelle; the C-111 Spreader Canal on the east side of 
Miami--west side of the Miami, and what this will do is keep 
Miami pollution from seeping back into the Everglades from the 
east; the Broward County water preserve area; and the Biscayne 
Bay Coastal Wetlands project. You can see they are all around 
the lake; it is not just centered in one area. Each of these 
projects is essential to completing the whole mosaic of 
restoring the watershed and the Everglades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Rooney">The cost to complete these projects is $1.7 billion, but 
the State of Florida will pay $800 million of that to complete 
C-43. It is worth noting how robust and vibrant is the 
partnership between South Florida Water Management and the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers. It is a great example of two areas of 
government working very well together. In the case of C-43, 
there were no Federal appropriations, so the State decided to 
go ahead and do the whole thing, and hopefully the Federal 
Government can catch up on some of these other projects that 
would offset that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Rooney">The 2016 WRRDA bill contained several new CERP 
authorizations, one of which is the Central Everglades Planning 
Project, which is six projects for $1.9 billion, which 
constructs a whole series of projects to bring 210,000-acre 
feet of Lake Okeechobee water down into the Everglades into 
storage treatment basins, and then into the water conservation 
areas and down into the national park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Rooney">The CERP includes several features, including backfilling 
of some canals that impede the flow of the water, and removing 
of some old levees and roads, and construction of a 15,000-acre 
foot Flow Equalization Basin, just west of an existing one that 
was recently built by the State of Florida. The one that was 
built by the State of Florida was taking in water of 400 parts 
per billion of dissolved pollutants, mostly phosphates, and 
turning it out at 10 or 12. So these are very effective 
devices, and so this is a great opportunity to expand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Rooney">The second WRRDA authorization project is to finish the 
Picayune Strand. That is a 55,000-acre of drained wetlands in 
Collier County, which also has flood control aspects of 
draining several neighborhoods to the north and it is last 133 
million of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Rooney">So and lastly, in addition to these projects, the Corps is 
responsible for the repair and replacement of the Hoover Dike, 
which was built in the 1930s to prevent some of the terrible 
floods that happened then. And it wasn't constructed all that 
well. Construction back then was done differently than 
constructions done now, and the Corps has done the first 40 
miles, and there is about two-thirds left to complete. That is 
$800 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Rooney">So basically, the Corps has supplied a high of $120 million 
back in 2010, and we are down to a low of, like, $69 million 
last year, so we are hoping that we can continue to demonstrate 
how important these projects are, and that we try to keep them 
moving forward to the extent that the committee can fit that 
into your, I know, very difficult work schedule and great 
demands for your money, but I appreciate your time today. Thank 
you very much.</paragraph>

Rooney for being such an articulate spokesman for the 
Everglades and for your region. You really fight for her. Your 
constituents are fortunate.

    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> This committee has a lot to do with it, too.
Obviously, from the Interior Subcommittee, so both the 
committee--the Interior Committee have a lot to do with funding 
the restoration of the Everglades and trying to get it back 
into shape, and we will be down there as soon as you get rid of 
those pythons.

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joyce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Joyce">I would like to point out that I had the
opportunity to go down and tour with the Everglades Foundation, 
and they have the same algal water problem, algal blooms, that 
we suffer in Lake Erie, and there are a lot of good projects 
that are being done, and so any way we could help Congressman 
Rooney along these lines would be, I am sure, deeply 
appreciated by the people down there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Joyce">    It is hard to fathom that they push out a half trillion 
gallons of freshwater into the ocean every year because they 
can't contain it in the Everglades, and as we all know, those 
are nature's kidneys, so the more we can do to help them, the 
better off the Everglades will be.

HON. JAMES COMER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Comer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Comer">Thank you. Chairman Simpson, Ranking Member
Kaptur, thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding the 
fiscal year 2018 Energy and Water Development and Related 
Agencies Appropriations bill. I testify to urge adequate 
funding for two very important projects to the First District 
of Kentucky, the Paducah Department of Energy cleanup site, and 
the Kentucky Lock Addition Project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Comer">First, I ask this committee to fully fund the Paducah 
Department of Energy cleanup site. As you may know, in 1959, 
the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant opened to support this 
country's nuclear weapons program, and later transitioned to 
produce nuclear fuel for commercial power plants. Because of 
this work, significant amounts of contaminated soil and 
groundwater remain at the site. Deactivation and cleanup work 
began in July 2014, and while much progress has been made, 
there is still much work yet to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Comer">Funding closer to the fiscal year 2014 level is imperative 
to allow the Department of Energy to accelerate the C-400 
building cleanout project, which is connected to hazards 
associated with historic groundwater contamination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Comer">Second, I ask this committee to adequately fund the Army 
Corps of Engineers' construction account to continue the work 
of upgrading our waterways infrastructure. The Kentucky Lock 
Addition Project in my district is an example of a much-needed 
project that would benefit from adequate funding for Corps 
construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Comer">The Kentucky Lock Addition Project was authorized in the 
Water Resources Development Act of 1996. This project includes 
design and construction of a new 110-by-1200 lock to be located 
landward of the existing 110-by-600 lock. Products originated--
originating from or designated to 20 States pass through 
Kentucky Lock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Comer">Since most of the tows are greater than 600 feet in length, 
they must perform a very time-consuming double lockage to 
transit through the existing 600-foot--600-foot long Kentucky 
Lock. As a result, Kentucky Lock has some of the longest 
average delay times of any lock in the inland waterway system, 
with the average delay of over 8 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Comer">Recently, the Inland Waterways User Board learned that the 
total project cost would increase by $380 million to $1.2 
billion due to the uncertainty of sufficient funding. Without 
sufficient funding, the expected completion date of 2024 will 
add at least 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Comer">Therefore, I respectfully request that the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers' construction account receive sufficient funding 
to avoid delays to completion of projects like the Kentucky 
Lock Addition and escalating project prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Comer">Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and if 
anyone has any questions, I will be happy to answer them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Comer">    [The information follows:]

    <speaker>Mr. Newhouse</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Newhouse"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to say
that I appreciate Mr. Comer's bringing to our attention the 
nuclear waste issues that you have in your district. I can 
certainly relate to the challenges and the importance of 
nuclear waste cleanup. We have a similar situation in my own 
district, and I just wanted to thank you for pointing that out, 
and also talking about the urgency of getting that kind of work 
done.

are kind of waiting for the next ones to show up here, but let 
me just take a moment to welcome the three new members that are

HON. JIMMY PANETTA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Panetta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate
that, Ranking Member Kaptur, other members of the committee. 
Thank you very much for this opportunity. I appreciate it. It 
is an honor to be here, as always.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Panetta">As many of you know or may not know, my family, I represent 
California's 20th Congressional District on the central coast. 
My family has deep roots in that area. My grandfather, an 
Italian immigrant, came to that area, my father was raised in 
that area, I was raised in that area, and now it is where my 
wife and I raise our two daughters. I am proud of that area not 
only because it is my home, but because I feel it has the most 
beautiful environment as well as the most bountiful 
agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Panetta">With both those traits, as you can imagine, we are 
constantly trying to find a balance, environmentally, 
economically, obviously politically, and with both those 
qualities, though, we are also trying to find effective water 
infrastructure, which is critical to that area. It ensures the 
environmental protection and it--which facilitates the economic 
activity of that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Panetta">And so today, I want to bring to your attention an ongoing 
Army Corps of Engineering project that does threaten the safety 
of the residents of a certain area in my district and the 
viability of the agricultural businesses of that same area. It 
is the Pajaro River Project. That consists of a series of 
levees built to protect the cities of Watsonville and Pajaro 
from flooding. Originally, these towns were settled by a large 
Croatian, Japanese, and Italian immigrant communities who came 
there to work the land, and yes, like my grandfather, to live 
the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Today, immigrants, mainly of Latino descent, continue to 
come to this area, work in the fields, and yes, contribute to 
our community. The Pajaro River Project was originally 
constructed in 1949 to protect the people of those communities. 
However, the Corps and the community have recognized that that 
project's flood protection has been inadequate. Watsonville 
only has a 25-year flood protection, and the town of Pajaro 
only has a 7-year protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Panetta">The levees have received a patchwork of repairs over the 
years, but that does not address the necessary flood 
protection, nor does it safeguard the citizens from harm, and 
even the Corps has estimated that there is an 82 percent threat 
of flood in the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Panetta">One of the most glaring examples of this type of threat was 
in 1995, where there was a large flood that dramatically 
impacted the locals in that area. It resulted in over $95 
million in damage to the surrounding communities, and hundreds 
of people were displaced as a result of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Panetta">One local who was personally impacted by that flood was a 
rose grower named Eugene Tsugi, T-s-u-g-i. His business, 2G 
Roses, was inundated with floodwaters. His home, as well as his 
sister's home, were damaged by floodwater. In fact, the damages 
that he sustained were well over $1 million. He used to joke 
that his son, who was born 2 days after the flood, would go to 
college before the levees in that area were repaired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Panetta">Well, unfortunately, due to a lack of action by the Army 
Corps of Engineers, that prediction was true. His son today is 
now an All American gymnast and a junior at the University of 
Washington near Seattle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Panetta">In 2015, the Pajaro Project was incorporated into the Corps 
3 years SMART planning timeline, with a deadline of March 2018 
for the completion of a feasibility study, and environmental 
impact statement. The Corps has failed to keep the project on 
schedule. Though the locals have fronted 3.2 million to date to 
keep the project moving, the project is still an estimated 18 
months behind schedule. It is an ongoing threat to the 
community. In the last 8 months, the community has spent 1.5 
million on emergency damage response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Panetta">The local non-Federal sponsors would like to keep this 
project moving, but they feel the Corps are not responsive, and 
it continues to be a threat to the safety of its local 
residents. Although last month, I met with Major General 
Jackson from the Army Corps to discuss the delays associated 
with this project, I found him to be very responsive. In fact, 
he is going to be traveling to the district to witness the 
project firsthand, and I hope that he sees the communities 
affected by the flooding, and he gets to hear from individuals 
who have suffered the damages from flooding, either to the 
property, and especially the agricultural businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Panetta">So today, I ask the committee for continued funding for 
these water projects. It is an investment in these projects 
that are critical for the communities who rely on them for 
safety and economic prosperity. When making these investments, 
we should ensure that we are holding the Corps accountable to 
their own timelines. I urge the inclusion of report language 
requiring the Corps to provide an update on the current status 
and timeline moving forward of all projects subject to the 3-
year SMART planning criteria within 90 days of the passage of 
this act. This would allow for increased oversight for the 
committee, while also increasing the accountability to local 
non-Federal sponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Panetta">To ensure that the value of agriculture land is 
appropriately calculated when conducting cost-benefit analysis, 
more work is needed. Agricultural land in the Pajaro Valley is 
some of the most valuable in the county. When flooding, these 
farms often miss multiple growing seasons as they address 
environmental and flood safety concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I have heard from locals that they believe that their 
agricultural land has been undervalued because the only value 
of the physical crop damage was accounted for. I also urge the 
inclusion of report language directing the Corps to incorporate 
the full economic value of agricultural land when completing 
its cost-benefit analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Panetta">This would make projects in rural communities more 
competitive for adoption into the Corps work plan by more 
accurately valuing the economic impact of agricultural 
production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Panetta">I thank you for your time. I look forward to working with 
you to advance the health, safety, and economic liability of 
our rural communities depending on these investments and our 
water infrastructure. Thank you.</paragraph>

there, but can you give us a bit of flavor?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Panetta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Panetta"> Of course. Look, in that area, it is the salad
bowl of the world, as you know, Pete. It is an area that has, 
you name it, we got it. Strawberries are the main crop in that 
area, brussel sprouts, raspberries, artichokes, leafy greens, 
spinach, you know, I can go on and on. There is over--that area 
has over 100 crops. More crops on the central coast are grown 
than any other single State. These are areas that basically 
feed the Nation. It puts these types of crops onto the shelves 
of our stores, and eventually onto the tables that our 
families--so our families can eat it.

    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> Mr. Newhouse.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Newhouse</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Newhouse"> I appreciate that. Thank you. First of all, I
wanted to compliment your constituents' excellent choice of 
looking north for quality education, but in light--and thank 
you for your effort to preserve valuable farmland in the State 
of California. In light of all the precipitation that we have 
gotten in the West Coast this year, is that exacerbating the 
problem as far as the flood concerns are right there in that 
area?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Panetta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Panetta">You know, the obvious answer is yes, there is
no doubt about that. But it is funny, during last year, you 
know, I went to a meeting where hundreds of community members 
showed up before the rains, and it has been an ongoing issue 
with them. So it is not just the rains that have highlighted 
this issue. This is something that if you live in that area, if 
you work in that area, if you do agriculture in this area, you 
know the risk that it can pose to that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Panetta">    And so, yes, it is obviously highlighted. They had to put 
$1.5 million in damage repair because of the flooding that we 
experienced, but this is going to keep on going and going if it 
is not fixed any time soon.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Newhouse</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Newhouse"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> I will say this, Congressman Farr, your
predecessor, approached me even a couple of years ago about 
this while it was not all these heavy rains and everything was 
not the issue. It was that there was no water at the time, but 
he still recognized the problem that we had there, so thank you 
for carrying on on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Panetta</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Panetta"> You bet. Thank you. Thank you to the
committee.

HON. BRIAN J. MAST, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Mast">I appreciate it, sir. Chairman, Ranking Member
Kaptur, the rest of you members here, I appreciate you letting 
me address you. I am here to advocate on behalf of robust 
funding to for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, basically to 
advance and expand their river and harbor maintenance, flood 
and storm damage reduction, shore protection, and environmental 
restoration missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Mast">In my Florida congressional district, which spans St. 
Lucie, Martin, and Palm Beach Counties, the most pressing issue 
that folks face really, there are harmful and unnatural massive 
discharges, sometimes up to 7 million gallons of freshwater per 
minute that are directed by the Corps of Engineers out of Lake 
Okeechobee and into the heart of our coastal saltwater 
community. These discharges, they are imposed by the Federal 
Government, and they turn the St. Lucie River and our 
Nation's--really the Nation's most species-diverse saltwater 
estuary, the Indian River Lagoon, into an algae-infested toxic 
waterway that surrounds hundreds of thousands of residents, and 
the resulting algal blooms, they kill beloved wildlife, like 
manatees and dolphins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Mast">These toxins that are released by the algal blooms, they 
hurt people through air and water, children can't go swimming 
or play near the water, the elderly residents must stay, you 
know, really inside of their homes if they live near the toxic 
air. These blooms also destroy our economy, because you can't 
sell a house that sits on top of toxic water. Nobody wants to 
go on vacation near toxic water. Nobody wants to go boating or 
fishing or anything like that in a giant stew of algae.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Mast">As a result, local and small businesses, our bars, our 
shops, our restaurants, paddle board companies, outdoor 
recreation stores, gas stations, fishing charters, they are all 
suffering. After fouling our community, the discharged water is 
simply lost out to sea. It is wasted, when it really could have 
been put to important use had it not been discharged in the 
first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Mast">Every time the Federal Government imposes these discharges, 
it means that hundreds of millions of gallons of water are less 
for drought reduction, hundreds of millions of gallons less for 
Everglades in Florida Bay, hundreds of millions of gallons less 
to replenish our Florida aquifers, the drinking water source 
for 8 million south Floridians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Mast">I can tell you these people in the Treasure Coastal of 
Florida, they understand the critical need for flood protection 
in the area and other communities surrounding ours, those south 
of Lake Okeechobee that prompt these discharges. However, my 
constituents back home, they just can't accept that despite a 
scientifically sound and decades'-old action plan, the State of 
Florida is fulfilling its financial responsibilities; the 
Federal attention and resources don't seem to respond to our 
water woes in the same way, regardless of how large the problem 
grows at either end of the Everglades ecosystem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Mast">The lack of responsiveness from Federal Government on 
Everglades restoration, it stems from one of three different 
places, different processes, all that feed into one another: 
project administration, project authorization, and project 
appropriations, and really delays in any one process. They 
impose further delays on the other processes, and when you are 
talking about more than 60 individual comprehensive Everglades 
ecosystem restoration plan projects, it can really add up in 
the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Mast">So administratively, the Army Corps of Engineers is 
reluctant to marry their flood control mission with their Lake 
Okeechobee and ecological restoration mission in the 
Everglades, but coordinating these missions is the key to 
ensuring that more water is directed towards Everglades 
National Park, and away from coastal communities like my own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Mast">As vice chair of the Water Resources and Environment 
Subcommittee, you can count on it being my priority to pass 
Water Resources Development Act that includes more CERP project 
authorizations, and from an appropriations standpoint, I can 
tell you there is more funding is needed to allow the Corps of 
Engineers to quicken the pace of rehabilitation of Herbert 
Hoover Dike around Lake Okeechobee. You know, just my ask to 
you all, let's get this done. Let's get it off the books, and 
let's get Florida's water system repaired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Mast">More funding is needed to accelerate the construction of 
these already authorized CERP projects, the Indian River 
Lagoon-South, the Central Everglades Project, among others. 
There is a number of CERP projects that are still awaiting 
authorization in part, because funding and legal limitations on 
the Corps of Engineers with respect to investigations and 
studies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Mast">I would respectfully ask that the subcommittee consider 
increasing the appropriations for the Army Corps investigations 
and to raise the cap on the number of study starts for 
environmental restoration projects the Secretary of the Army 
can green light in each fiscal year. One a year simply isn't 
sufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Mast">And, finally, I would like to welcome the Chairman, the 
Ranking Member, every member of this subcommittee down to the 
Treasure Coast to witness firsthand the devastating impacts 
that we see around Lake Okeechobee discharges and the harmful 
algal blooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Mast">I thank you all for your time and your important efforts to 
craft an Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill that 
reflects the concerns and the priorities of the American 
people. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Mast">    [The information follows:]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> Thank you. Other questions?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Mast"> Yes, ma'am.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> Ms. Kaptur.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Mast,
thank you so much for being here this morning. I wanted to ask 
you, you are in a really important position as vice chair of 
WRRDA, of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee and 
Transportation and Infrastructure. Your statement in the 
testimony, reluctant--``Army Corps is reluctant to marry their 
flood control mission at Lake Okeechobee with their ecological 
restoration mission in the Everglades,'' and you specifically 
mention algal blooms, which is a gigantic problem in the lake 
that I represent, Lake Erie in the north.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">    I am interested in that dysfunction. Why do you think that 
happens? It is really important that you recognize that in your 
testimony, reluctant to marry their flood control mission with 
their ecological restoration mission? Is there something wrong 
with the authorizing legislation?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Mast">Well, you know, when we look at the flood control
mission, they are taking water that naturally flows south 
towards the Florida Bay, and instead, they are sending it out 
the East Coast and the West Coast of Florida in a very 
unnatural way, and that is in the aim of flood protection, but 
at the same time, that water is, quite literally, needed in the 
Florida Everglades. The Florida Everglades are dry, they are 
drying up. They don't have the water that they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Mast">So at one point we are sending freshwater in directions 
where it is not naturally meant to go. The coastal estuaries 
are, by nature, saltwater, and we are releasing freshwater into 
them. So by nature, it is harmful, before you even talk about 
the added nutrients that are in the water, and that is water 
that is actually needed for ecosystem restoration further 
south, which is where we want to see it head to and where all 
of these existing projects, should they be brought to 
completion, they will work towards moving that water south.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Mast">    And so unfortunately, when it is not prioritized in that 
way, we end up causing damage to both ecosystems when sending 
water in one direction would really help both ecosystems.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Ms. Kaptur"> Were they badly designed in the beginning?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Mast">When you talk about ``badly designed in the
beginning,'' we are talking about going back, you know, 100-
plus years to when Lake Okeechobee was dammed up to begin with 
because it did used to naturally flow down to the Florida Bay, 
so we are talking about a very, very old problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Mast">But in that, yes. It is badly designed in that these 
projects are not being allowed to come to completion. The point 
that I make to people is this often, when you are talking about 
the design of this. The Hoover Dam, not the Herbert Hoover 
Dike, that was the Nation's biggest infrastructure project. 
That was built in 5 years. This project is literally taking 
decades. And when you consider how much smaller it is, that is 
something that should trouble every one of us, especially when 
you are talking about doing that kind of damage to both 
ecosystems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Mast">    We have to prioritize, you know, these projects, get them 
done, you know, in orders, you know, in the order that they 
give, so that we can see one after another after another come 
to completion, and end up not harming both ecosystems in the 
end.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Ms. Kaptur"> And could you describe the source of the algal
blooms?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Mast"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Ms. Kaptur"> The nutrients?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Mast">Yes, ma'am. So during, primarily, the summer
months, when there is an excess of rain that fills up the 
Florida watersheds, as we know, most water flows south, so when 
you get water north of Lake Okeechobee coming in on the 
Kissimmee River, which is also an issue. It was straightened by 
the Corps of Engineers. It used to run like a snake, but it was 
straightened out, so now the lake fills up something about six 
times faster than what it was originally designed to fill up 
at. That is what causes this need for releasing the water to 
the east and the west, because it can't get that water out of 
there quick enough. So you know, when we get those summer rains 
and it fills up that much, and there is added heat and that 
freshwater comes out into our coastal estuaries, that is how we 
get those algal blooms combined with the additional nutrients 
that are in this water to which I would make this point:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Mast">    For the Florida Everglades largely inhabited by snakes, 
turtles, alligators, and fowl, waterfowl, there are water 
standards for 10 parts per billion of phosphorous that can go 
down into the Florida Everglades. For the water that goes out 
to the East Coast and the West Coast of Florida where there are 
hundreds of thousands of residents, there are no water quality 
standards. Now, that is a State issue, but that is something 
that should be very troubling.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Ms. Kaptur"> Does agriculture contribute to the nutrients
loading?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Mast"> Without question. When you have agriculture in
and around, you know, any area that feeds into the watershed, 
absolutely, anything that goes onto those agriculture products 
are going to feed into that watershed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Ms. Kaptur"> Not knowing your area, is it animal
agriculture, or is it vegetables or fruits?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Mast"> So there is a plethora of agriculture. As I said,
you have a watershed that feeds from, you know, hundreds of 
miles north, from 100 miles north, you know near the Kissimmee 
River, that feeds in, all the agriculture surrounding that 
feeds into Lake Okeechobee, all of the agriculture fields, 
there is an entire area surrounding Lake Okeechobee called the 
Everglades Agricultural Area. It is all farming, and all of 
those areas and what is put on those crops, absolutely, that 
plays a role into what is going into Lake Okeechobee, and what 
is spilling out into the coastal estuaries.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I thank the gentleman. I thank the chairman for
your indulgence because Congressman Joyce and I share a very 
serious issue in Lake Erie, shallows to the Great Lakes that is 
moving toward death right now as we sit here, and it drains the 
largest watershed in the Great Lakes region, and all the 
instrumentalities we have have not put us on pathway to really 
solve that problem fast enough. And, so, I look at your area 
and I am listening and I am saying, huh, there is some 
similarities here in this 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">    We have to look at these watersheds, and we have to have a 
different way of approaching them more quickly, and we don't 
have that mechanism yet that some of our prior witnesses talked 
about the State government having responsibility for certain 
projects, working with the Federal Government, and the Federal 
Government doesn't fund its share, but this is--this is a 21st 
century problem, and we don't have the proper structure to move 
quickly enough. So I appreciate your testimony, and I 
appreciate the----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Mast">Can I give you one other point on that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Mast">    Ms. Kaptur [continuing].--Chair's indulgence. Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Mast">Just on your point just now. You know, when you
look at ERDC, energy--rather, Engineering, Resource, and 
Development where they basically do all the testing for 
projects surrounding the Corps of Engineers, they don't have, 
you know, the robust resources to go out there and pursue 
research into ways to fix your algal blooms, my algal blooms, 
those that go on down into Louisiana at the massive level that 
we see them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Mast">    When we are talking about cleaning a fish tank, yeah, that 
is something that we can do, but when we are talking about a 
rate at 7 million gallons a minute, or whatever it is that you 
may experience up there, or whatever it is that they experience 
down, you know, along the Mississippi and other places, I think 
this would be a great place as well to put research in, being 
that it is affecting so many different areas.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kaptur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Ms. Kaptur"> Your statement, that is what I was interested
in, ``reluctant to marry their flood control mission with their 
ecological restoration mission.'' That is a very insightful 
contribution to thinking about this. In our area, we have the 
problem that stretches over three States and another--a part of 
another nation, and so we can't get our arms around it, and 
yet, we know it is happening and we are not responding quickly 
enough, so thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> Thank you. Thank you for being here today. We
appreciate it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joyce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Joyce"> Mr. Chairman.----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simpson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Simpson"> Mr. Joyce.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joyce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Joyce"> When you talk about Lake Okeechobee, the
diversion of the water east and west, is that because of the 
potential failure of the dike?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Mast">That is exactly correct, sir. So you have--after
Hurricane Katrina, the Corps of Engineers went around and 
assessed dikes around the country. The dike around Lake 
Okeechobee was determined to be one of the worst dikes existing 
around the country, and so that is where they determined--based 
on there is a lower schedule, Lake Okeechobee regulation 
schedule that determines the height at which you can keep the 
lake. They decided they had to keep it a lower level, and that 
is where they, you know, really, in a massive scale, started 
distributing water out the East Coast and the West Coast of 
Florida in a very unnatural way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Mast">    Like I said, freshwater, and we all know what a commodity 
freshwater is in many parts of this country, going out, simply 
lost into saltwater estuaries where it is very damaging.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joyce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Joyce"> I am one to believe that is our version of oil,
freshwater, potable water supply, and the idea that you are 
sending it out east and west. The other problem would be if it 
is--if I heard you correctly, that this is a collection, if you 
will, of agricultural discharge, so therefore, the lake must be 
loaded with phosphates?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Mast"> That is exactly correct, and that is where, you
know, I brought about the point as well where you talk about 
there is a requirement for the level of phosphorous that goes 
down to the Florida Everglades where there is, you know, 
largely wildlife habitat, but there is not a requirement for a 
standard that go out towards where people are boating, fishing, 
skiing, playing, jumping in the water out of their backyards, 
you know, where the bulk of the population is, and that is very 
troubling to me.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joyce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Joyce"> You also mentioned that there have been some
issues with this dike. If the dike should go, all that would be 
then set loose into the Everglades and the damage would be 
permanent?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Mast</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Mast">Should the dike fail, there is also population
south of Lake Okeechobee, and that is where people recognize 
the need for flood control. Nobody is advocating that we not 
take into consideration the lives that are south of that dike 
in Lake Okeechobee because if that were to fail, there would be 
a massive loss of life, and nobody should overlook that, but 
that is also where it would be very beneficial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Mast">One of the things that is not being looked at right now is 
that lower schedule, that Lake Okeechobee regulation schedule, 
it is one of the most important things that could be looked at 
because as every one of those 60-plus projects of Everglades 
restoration in Lake Okeechobee, dike restoration come online, 
the Corps of Engineers should be assessing can they take the 
Lake Okeechobee level an inch or 6 inches or a foot higher, 
because when you are talking about the hundreds of miles of 
breadth of Lake Okeechobee, every inch, or every foot that you 
can add to that lake is billions, and sometimes hundreds of 
billions of gallons of water that you no longer have to release 
into unnatural areas, and this is another place where the Corps 
could really work, but we are not seeing a pathway for them to 
adjust that with every instance of them making an improvement 
to the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Mast">    They are, instead, looking to wait for about 8 years down 
the line and just do one adjustment then, and this is that 
mechanism where you specifically talked about marrying flood 
control and marrying ecosystem restoration. That is--that is, 
in my opinion, one of the biggest things that can be done to 
marry flood control and ecosystem restoration is every time you 
get something online, look at that regulation schedule and say 
we can take this many gallons offline going out the East and 
the West Coast of Florida where it is causing damage.

HON. PAUL A. GOSAR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gosar</speaker>
    <overview>Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, and vice chairman</overview>
    <option>Subcommittee on the Interior.</option>
    <option>    Critical programs and oversight activities addressed----
    Mr. Simpson. Paul, could you turn on your mic?
    Mr. Gosar. Critical programs and oversight activities 
addressed by the Energy and Water Development and Related 
Agencies bill fall under the purview as well. I would like to 
take an opportunity to discuss several of these today.
    Last fiscal year's subcommittee bill contained a rider 
prohibiting any changes to Federal jurisdiction under the Clean 
Water Act, effectively preventing funds from being spent to 
implement Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, that rule put 
forth in 2015 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the 
Environmental Protection Agency. The WOTUS rule attempted to 
assert Clean Water Act jurisdictions over nearly all areas with 
even the slightest of connections to water resources, including 
manmade conveyances.
    Farmers, ranchers, job creators, and private property 
owners would suffer under this overreaching water grab. WOTUS 
contradicts numerous prior Supreme Court decisions and seeks to 
expand agency control over 60 percent of our country's streams 
and millions of acres of wetlands that were previously 
nonjurisdictional.
    WOTUS was slated to go into effect August 28 of 2015, and 
fortunately, the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay that 
has temporarily blocked implementation of this new rule. Even 
more promising, just last week, President Trump signed an 
executive order requiring the EPA and the Corps to rescind and 
revise any aspects of WOTUS inconsistent with Federal law. This 
was great news, and I was honored to join the President in the 
Oval Office for that signing.
    While I have great confidence in President Trump and 
Administrator Pruitt, the review required by the order will 
take some time and there could be subsequent legal proceedings. 
Accordingly, Congress must, once again, take a clear position 
against WOTUS and retain the important provision prohibiting 
the expansion of the Clean Water Act in this fiscal year's 
bill.
    Another important rider from last year's bill that must be 
maintained defunds the Obama administration's social cost of 
carbon models. These flawed metrics can be easily manipulated 
in order to attempt to justify new job-killing regulations.
    For instance, the Obama administration attempted to justify 
the EPA's methane rule utilizing the social cost of carbon, 
stating that the rule would supposedly yield climate benefits 
of $690 million in 2025. Those speculative benefits, that can 
be easily manipulated, supposedly outweigh the $530 million the 
rule is expected to cost businesses and job creators in 2025 
alone.
    The House has passed at least 11 different amendments 
rejecting the social cost of carbon in the last two Congresses 
alone. We must block these flood models once again in this 
year's bill.
    Now, section 507 of the bill last year, last fiscal year, 
contained a provision prohibiting the removal of any Federally 
owned or operated dams in fiscal year 2017. I thank the 
subcommittee for including this important provision, and, once 
again, ask that it be retained.
    In recent years, extremist environmental groups have 
increased efforts to dismantle and remove Federal dams. These 
efforts defy common sense, particularly at a time of major 
water challenges across the west, and with an increasing need 
for clean hydropower. Electricity generated from the Corps and 
reclamation dams--operated dams, is utilized by millions of 
Americans every day. Many of these dams are essential 
components for flood control, strategic water storage, and live 
sustaining irrigation for millions of acres of American 
agriculture. Tens of millions of Americans rely on these dams 
to supply their drinking water and support their livelihoods.
    The vital water energy, economic, and ecological benefits 
provided by the Federally owned and operated dams must be 
protected. I, once again, ask the subcommittee to retain the 
important provision prohibiting the removal of any Federally 
owned and operated dams in fiscal year 2018.
    Finally, I would like to ask that the subcommittee continue 
to provide important resources for the Corps of Engineers' 
construction and investigations budgets. These accounts ensure 
the timely development of critical water and infrastructure 
projects that provide benefits for communities throughout the 
Nation. We must continue to provided adequate resources for the 
important projects funded by these accounts.
    I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. The Western 
Caucus looks forward to coordinating closely with all of you in 
the future, and thank you, Chairman Simpson. With that, I yield 
back.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Gosar. Other questions?
    Ms. Kaptur.
    Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to 
ask Representative Gosar, for your own district, I don't know 
it, how many counties it covers and from where do you obtain 
clean water?
    Mr. Gosar. We obtain clean water within the State 
jurisdiction, which is what I have been talking about is the 
jurisdiction is subsurface water, which is the jurisdiction of 
the State.
    Ms. Kaptur. But I am saying for your district, in 
particular, does it come----
    Mr. Gosar. I am talking to you exactly what the majority of 
my water is from subsurface water within the State of Arizona.
    Ms. Kaptur. Wells?
    Mr. Gosar. Absolutely, and the jurisdiction of the State.
    Ms. Kaptur. Your district is heavily rural?
    Mr. Gosar. Almost all of it.
    Ms. Kaptur. Almost all of it. All right. So you don't--you 
don't receive any of these Federal water projects that exist in 
the west, your district doesn't benefit from any of that?
    Mr. Gosar. We border between Arizona and California, so the 
Colorado always has those infrastructure processes. I have also 
initiated one in the southern part with Mexico on the lower 
Santa Cruz that is federally mandated, absolutely.
    Ms. Kaptur. All right. What percentage of the water that 
your constituents drink actually then comes from subsurface 
water, 80, 90 percent?
    Mr. Gosar. Pretty much.
    Ms. Kaptur. Wow. All right. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Gosar. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. Other questions? Hearing none, thank you, Mr. 
Gosar. I appreciate your testimony and----
    Mr. Gosar. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Simpson [continuing]. Giving us your views on this 
upcoming bill.
    Congressman Crist, should I call you Governor? Congressman?
    Mr. Crist. I can't hold a job. Charlie always works, 
though.
    Mr. Simpson. Welcome to the committee.

HON. CHARLIE CRIST, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
    FLORIDA
    Mr. Crist. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, Chairman 
Simpson, Ranking Member Kaptur, and members of the 
subcommittee. It is a great honor to appear before you today. 
As you know, this is my first chance to testify before an 
Appropriations subcommittee. For me, it is a special 
opportunity because your former colleague and former chairman 
of the full committee, and someone I hold in the highest 
esteem, the late Congressman Bill Young, who served with you 
for so many years, was my Congressman for decades.
    During his time in Congress and on this committee, he did 
many great things for our Nation, our State and my Pinellas 
County. Many of those projects live on today, and I would like 
to talk to you about a few of them this morning.
    First is the Pinellas County Shore Protection Project. The 
Army Corps of Engineers, the State of Florida, Pinellas County, 
and our local communities, have been tremendous partners in 
maintaining our 20 beautiful miles of beach coastline to 
protect the people and property along it. Much of the support 
of this project was generated by the committee, for which I am 
grateful. I am here to ask for your continued support.
    The funding you provide for the Army Corps is critical in 
delivering the resources Pinellas County needs for our beaches. 
Beach nourishment not only protects public and private 
infrastructure, it is a great economic generator for our 
region.
    A second request I would make of the subcommittee related 
to fiscal year 2017 is to help us finish a project Congressman 
Young started back in 2002. The seven members of our Tampa Bay 
area delegation are sending you a letter asking the committee 
to help us break through a bureaucratic new start deadlock that 
has stalled construction of the Port of Tampa's congressionally 
authorized Big Bend Channel navigation project. This deepening 
and widening project will improve the movement of goods through 
the port of the I-4 corridor, essentially, Florida's fastest 
growing part of the State.
    It will set the standard for public-private partnership by 
turning a mere 20 percent of Federal stake in the project into 
a $55 million economic development initiative that will create 
8,000 jobs for our region. My Tampa Bay colleagues and I are 
not requesting any funding for this project. Instead, we seek 
language for the fiscal year 2017 bill you are finalizing to 
clarify it.
    I want to briefly mention also the Everglades, and I want 
to give credit to my freshman colleague and one of your new 
colleagues from Naples, Florida, Representative Francis Rooney. 
He is championing this effort. He is on the other side of the 
aisle, and I am grateful for what he is doing. I am incredibly 
grateful also for the consistent backing by this subcommittee 
for America's Everglades, and respectfully ask that you 
continue it. Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. I appreciate you being here, 
Congressman Crist. Questions for Congressman Crist? Hearing 
none, thanks for--thanks for being here today, and we will take 
those views into consideration as we try to do our 2017 and 
2018 budget.
    Mr. Crist. Right. It will go well.
    Mr. Simpson. It will be a challenge.
    Mr. Crist. Yes, sir, of course. We will do it together.
    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Tipton.

                                WITNESS
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
    COLORADO
    Mr. Tipton. Thank you, Chairman Simpson. I would like to 
also thank Ranking Member Kaptur and members of the committee. 
I welcome this opportunity to be able to appear before you and 
thank you for your interest and priorities of your colleagues 
as you make difficult decisions on infrastructure and program 
and investment, particularly in the area of water resources.
    The Third Congressional District of Colorado has partnered 
with the Bureau of Reclamation for at least seven decades, 
working together to develop hugely important and beneficial 
multi-use projects in southern and western Colorado. These 
projects have provided necessary water supply, which has 
sustained our agricultural, industrial, and recreation 
economies, and continue to help our small communities grow and 
prosper.
    I am distinctly aware that the mission of the Bureau of 
Reclamation is changing, and that the construction of large 
water supply projects with all Federal dollars is likely a 
thing of the past, but the partnership the Bureau has with the 
local water districts and providers remains critical in the 
semi-arid West, where the development and conservation and 
management of this finite resource is absolutely essential.
    The need for this local Federal partnership could not be 
clearer than the pursuit of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, the 
last component of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project authorized in 
1962. Since an amendment to that original authorization was 
enacted in 2009, this committee has provided funding, which has 
contributed to the completion of the required environmental 
analysis and the ongoing feasibility work. The current schedule 
would likely allow for construction to begin in 2019 or 2020.
    The purpose of my testimony today is to strongly encourage 
you to provide sufficient funds to move this project forward in 
a timely, and, therefore, economical fashion and urge you to 
recognize the interest and responsibility that the Federal 
Government has in building this project. The water supply for 
50,000 people living in the Lower Arkansas Valley is 
contaminated with naturally occurring radionuclides. 
Approximately 40 small water providers face the task of finding 
new water supply or treating the supply they have.
    The Arkansas Valley Conduit, as a regional rather than a 
piecemeal solution, is a more functional and more fiscally 
effective way to meet the challenges for safe drinking water. 
Many of these small providers from the Colorado Department of 
Public Health and Environment, for failing to meet the Federal 
mandated Safe Water Drinking Act standards, should it prove 
necessary, the State of Colorado has approved a $60 million 
loan to move the project forward in a partnership with the 
Bureau of Reclamation.
    The local water providers are paying for administration, 
planning, and environmental compliance through quarterly 
assessments, working closely with the Southwestern Colorado 
Water Conservancy District to move the project forward. I would 
like it noted that under the provisions of the 2009 
legislation, the revenues generated locally can repay the 
entire cost over the project.
    The Fryingpan-Arkansas Project generates revenue by storing 
nonproject water for a price. Water providers enter into long-
term contracts with reclamation to store the water in the 
Pueblo reservoir. That revenue stream for full repayment makes 
this project and its financing unique. It should also be noted 
that the Southeastern District, the State of Colorado, and the 
Colorado Congressional Delegation are fully aware of the fiscal 
constraints we face and of the changing mission of the Bureau.
    To that end, we are working on meaningful cost-saving 
measures, including use of existing facilities for treatment 
and delivery wherever possible, and possibly design-build 
processes. Both of these efforts will save money and deliver 
clean drinking water faster to the communities who desperately 
need it.
    The people of the Lower Arkansas Valley deserve no less 
than that. It is for their health that the Federal Government 
creates water quality standards, and the Federal Government has 
the responsibility to help these communities meet those 
standards.
    Thank you, again, for providing me the opportunity to 
testify today, and I look forward to working with you to ensure 
the dream of completing the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project as it 
becomes a reality, and the Arkansas Valley Conduit is built.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Congressman.
    Mr. Tipton. Thank you for your time.
    Mr. Simpson. I appreciate you being here today. Are there 
questions for Congressman Tipton? Ms. Kaptur.
    Ms. Kaptur. I just wanted to ask the Congressman, thank you 
so much for your testimony. What a name for a project, the 
Fryingpan. I just wanted to ask you, these elements, 
radioactive, either radium or uranium, are these new? Or is it 
just that they have discovered this now?
    Mr. Tipton. These are naturally occurring.
    Ms. Kaptur. Uh-huh. Are there elevated levels of cancer in 
that particular part of Colorado?
    Mr. Tipton. You know, I am not sure if there are elevated 
elements, but under the Clean Water Act, it was a 
responsibility that the EPA put forward to be able to provide 
safe, clean drinking water for the communities in the Lower 
Arkansas Valley. This started back in 1962. John Kennedy 
actually visited Pueblo, Colorado, for the initiation of this 
project, so it is long term in coming, and I guess, 
Representative Kaptur, it is really the responsibility of the 
Federal Government through this mandate for clean drinking 
water, which I think we all share and understand it is 
important for our communities to be able to get this project 
off of center, to be able to move this forward, and to be able 
to get it completed.
    Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. We learned--I learned a great deal 
from other members, so I just thank you very much for 
testifying today.
    Mr. Tipton. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. Any other questions? 1962 to today is only 55 
years. That is kind of quick for government work, isn't it?
    Mr. Tipton. I didn't speak for the government.
    Mr. Simpson. I appreciate you being here today, and thank 
you for your testimony.
    Mr. Tipton. Thank you, Chairman.
    Mr. Simpson. We are going to take a short break while we 
await the next individuals that are coming to testify, so we 
will be in recess for just a couple of minutes.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Simpson. The committee will be back in order. We have 
with us Congressman Foster from Illinois. The floor is yours 
for 5 minutes.

                                WITNESS
HON. BILL FOSTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
    ILLINOIS
    Mr. Foster. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Simpson.
    Mr. Simpson. Microphone on?
    Mr. Foster. Thank you, Chairman Simpson, Ranking Member 
Kaptur, for holding this Members' Day, and to all the members 
of the subcommittee for allowing me to testify today. I am here 
to, first of all, thank you for your past support for the 
Department of Energy's Office of Science, and to urge you to 
continue to prioritize and invest in science.
    The United States has been at the forefront of innovation 
and progress, largely due to its investment in scientific 
research. It has helped raise the standard of living for 
millions of Americans in our past and represents the best hope 
for economic progress in our future. But this scientific 
progress requires us to take a long view.
    Discoveries are not made overnight, and the experiments 
need sustained attention and resources for us to learn from 
them. Scientific investments are not like building a road where 
you can cancel it and restart it at the drop of a hat. The 
scientific programs have to be built up over decades, but can 
be destroyed in a single budget cycle by having their project 
underfunded.
    Similarly, our scientific infrastructure requires a long-
term sustained funding to ensure that opportunities are not 
missed. You know, as the only Ph.D. scientist in the United 
States Congress, I serve as a lightning rod for concerns from 
science, from high-tech businesses that depend on that science, 
from academics, and from ordinary citizens who care about the 
future economic and scientific progress in our country.
    And so I have heard from a number of my former colleagues 
in science in the scientific community who are very worried 
about what the incoming administration could mean for 
scientific progress in this country. So I would urge this 
subcommittee to seize the opportunity to put researchers, the 
companies that depend on that research, and, you know, all--
everyone who cares about science in this country, to put them 
at ease by providing funding levels that support the critical 
work for the Department of Energy's Office of Science.
    There are two specific projects that I want to highlight 
here today. Both of these are projects that have to have 
significant construction start money, you know, in the upcoming 
cycle, or the teams that put them together and are prepared to 
make them a reality will dissipate. You cannot--you cannot keep 
projects on hold forever.
    These two projects are Argonne National Labs Advanced 
Photon Source Upgrade, and the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility, 
and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, so-called LBNF/
DUNE, which represents a collaboration between Fermi National 
Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, and the Sanford Underground 
Research Facility in South Dakota.
    Starting with Argonne first. The experiments conducted at 
Argonne National Lab's Advanced Photon Source, or APS, support 
both discovery science fundamental research, and also market-
driven research. Its facilities are used by companies that have 
products to develop.
    Pharmaceutical research at the APS has yielded lifesaving 
new drugs for HIV, for melanoma, and for renal cell carcinoma. 
Industry chemists have used the APS to develop energy-saving 
solar shingles, while combustion researchers have developed a 
process that has led to cleaner diesel engines. And research 
conducted at the APS led to a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2012 
for the work on what are called G-protein coupled receptors, 
which are the mechanism at the heart of the addiction mechanism 
inside people's brain, and so with the heroin epidemic 
ravaging.
    This allows scientists to look at these molecules in 
action, the ones that are at the very heart signaling the 
cells, the neurons that make the decisions that are affected by 
opioids. So this is fundamental research. I am not promising 
that they are going to cure the opioid epidemic this year, but 
you know, it is only this sort of long-term research that 
allows us to actually, dream of a cure for this, as well as 
Nobel Prizes, which as a scientist, I have a certain fondness 
for.
    The APS needs to be upgraded to ensure that the American 
scientists and companies continue to have access to the best 
scientific equipment in the world. The competition in this area 
is fierce with dozens, literally dozens of competing facilities 
under construction, and in operation around the world. But the 
APS upgrade will use next-generation technology to make the APS 
hundreds of times brighter, which opens up a vast array of 
scientific frontiers at the nanoscale that are completely 
inaccessible at any machine anywhere in the world today.
    So this upgrade will leverage the existing infrastructure 
at the Advanced Photon Source valued at about $1.5 billion, 
while applying a new technology to create a world--a world-
leading facility at substantially less cost than building a 
facility from scratch. And with this upgrade, the APS will 
become the ultimate 3-D microscope. Without it, the United 
States will lose its global leadership in X-ray science to 
Europe, Japan, and China.
    Robust funding for the Department of Energy basic energy 
science major items of equipment line will enable the APS 
upgrade to continue and proceed on schedule, and more 
importantly, on budget. A funding delay, I should say, on a 
personal note, that my wife was one of the great 
accomplishments of the Office of Science, was the completion of 
the last photon source, light source on time and under budget. 
My wife was the construction manager for that at Brookhaven 
National Laboratory.
    So, but funding delay will add millions of dollars to the 
total cost of this project. Second critical opportunity where 
this year's funding is particularly important is the LBNF/DUNE 
project, which will be critical to maintaining U.S.'s 
leadership in high energy physics and in fundamental science. 
This facility, part of which is located a Fermi National 
Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, where I worked for 
25 years, and the other part of which is located in the Sanford 
Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota, will be 
the first major international world class facility to be 
hosted--of its kind, to be hosted by the United States.
    So getting foreign money flowing into the U.S., in addition 
to U.S. money flowing to facilities in foreign countries is, to 
my mind, you know, essential, to having a healthy international 
scientific collaboration, you know, just a network of 
scientific collaboration internationally.
    Neutrinos, which will be studied there, are among the most 
abundant particles in the universe and our understanding of 
their nature may provide the key to answering some of the most 
fundamental questions about the nature of our universe. LBNF/
DUNE would be the most powerful tool in the world to study 
these particles, and would help solidify the Department of 
Energy's high energy physics program as a world leader.
    And so, I am hopeful that the project will receive the $55 
million required in fiscal year 2017 to start construction for 
this project. Again, facilities like this are always in a grow-
or-die situation. If you assemble the team and say we are going 
to start construction and then say, well, maybe not this year, 
people leave and they cannot be reassembled. Like I say, it is 
not like just building a highway where you have millions of 
competent contractors happy to bid on any new section of the 
roadway.
    So more than 770 scientists from 150 institutes and 26 
countries stand ready to contribute scientifically and 
economically to the LBNF/DUNE project, if we decide to make it 
go ahead, and I urge the subcommittee to provide full support 
and robust funding for the Department of Energy's high energy 
physics account.
    Investments in these projects, and in our broader 
scientific infrastructure, is really the only way to ensure 
that America remains an international leader in science. You 
know, we are--in testimony to Congress more than a generation 
ago, the guy who started--the guy who started Fermi lab was 
asked, Well, what is all this basic fundamental scientific 
research that you are doing? How does this contribute to 
national defense, which is obviously the competition? And he 
looked back at the committee and said, our research, our 
fundamental research, has nothing to do with national defense, 
except perhaps to make our country more worth defending.
    And that is the heart of the reason that our country should 
invest in fundamental research like that at Argonne Lab, like 
that at Fermi lab. If you look back in history, the reason that 
we respect what the--you know, what the Manichees did in, well, 
hundreds of years ago in Italy. It is not because they won 
their wars against their opponents. It is not because they 
succeeded in economics and commerce. It is because after doing 
all of that, they diverted a significant fraction of their GDP 
to fundamental research by the likes of Leonardo da Vinci, and 
that is why they will remain in the history textbooks forever. 
And so we should have no lower goal for our country. Thank you.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. I appreciate your testimony. Are 
there questions for the Congressman?
    Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congressman 
Foster, I want to thank you personally. You and I have worked 
together on a number of initiatives. Also, for the benefit of 
the entire subcommittee, the super computing initiative has 
been so critically important to our country and will remain so. 
We are in very dire competition with the Chinese. At one point 
in time, we had the fastest super computers in the world. We 
have now fallen to third, I believe, in that race, from 
petaflops to Exascale. I know Argonne is very involved in that, 
Oakridge as well, but I want to personally thank you for your 
advocacy for the Office of Science. Oakridge is intimately 
involved.
    Mr. Foster. A key collaborator in all of these sort of 
projects. And, you know, there have been a number of Members of 
Congress who have taken a little time off because their 
districts have been hit by tornadoes. Any of you who doubt the 
power of super computers should look at the simulations of 
tornadoes where you see detailed simulations of tornadoes 
trying to understand what affects their formation and how to 
predict and how they will develop.
    And so this is just one of the many examples of where super 
computers at places like Oakridge will really contribute to, 
the lives of so many in ways that are not often in the front 
pages of newspapers.
    Mr. Fleischmann. Congressman, we thank you for your 
advocacy and for your help on these key critical areas. Thank 
you, sir.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Any other questions?
    Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to thank 
Congressman Foster. It must be--just thinking about your life 
and engagement with all of these very high-level research 
initiatives and you are a Member of Congress, sometimes it must 
feel like a fish out of water being in this body.
    Mr. Foster. I do feel lonely from time to time.
    Ms. Kaptur. But you are a very effective spokesman, and 
someone who can put visions for new science in understandable 
terms, and so your presence is truly appreciated, and you have 
made that transition very nobly for your constituents but also 
for the country. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. A fish out of water would be an apt 
description for all of us. Mr. Polis.
    Thank you, Congressman Foster.

                                WITNESS
HON. JARED POLIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
    COLORADO
    Mr. Polis. Thank you, Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member 
Kaptur. I am coming before a number of the subcommittees to 
suggest some cuts in appropriations. I know that there are 
going to be cuts in most of the lines, so I hope to be 
constructive.
    In the past, I have offered various amendments to cut 
spending on the floor of the House, supported both across-the-
board cuts as well as particular line items cuts, and I have a 
few ideas for you here today for your line item. The first 
major spending line that I would like to recommend a cut for is 
the Fossil Energy Research and Development line item. This is a 
line item with an expiration. It is a dead end in the sense 
that our fossil fuels will be depleted, not only in America and 
around the world. Markets are already turning away from dirty 
fuels, fuels like coal and oil, not just for economic reasons, 
but also for the health and safety of our oceans, our air, and 
our planet. And so, I would hope that the committee would, 
rather than invest in the past, invest in the future.
    The version of this bill that came to the House floor last 
year actually appropriated $300 million more pork for the oil 
and gas industry than even the President requested for the 
fossil research account. I know you have to make some tough 
decisions. I think this will be an excellent line item to cut, 
rather than give more pork to the oil and gas industry. We can 
cut that out and reduce our budget deficit by $645 million. 
That was what the bill included last year. I would encourage 
you to zero out that line item, or, at the very least, cut it 
back significantly.
    If you do cut the $645 million back significantly, while I 
hope that the bulk of it goes to deficit reduction, another 
account that I would--with part of those proceeds, I would 
encourage you plus up would be the Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy Fund, which, actually, invests in the future, 
the future of energy in our country. If we can increase it a 
little bit, it will help fund national labs, like the National 
Renewable Energies Laboratory. From 2009 to 2015, EERE's 
building technology office finalized 40 new or updated 
efficiency standards for more than 45 household and commercial 
products, saving consumers money, so it actually saved 
consumers billions of dollars, reduced carbon pollution, and 
helped generate jobs in our country.
    So I think if you want to use some of those funds that you 
save from zeroing out the Fossil Energy Research and 
Development Fund, that would be a good place to put some of 
those, and, of course, I know you have to make cuts overall, so 
I understand some of those cuts, if not all, would go to the 
bottom line.
    I also want to highlight EERE's work with private companies 
to apply 3-D printing, an additive manufacturing to renewable 
technologies, particularly making blades of wind turbines. With 
additive manufacturing, we can reduce the cost of blades, 
reduce the cost of wind energy, as well as highlight their work 
on plug-in electric vehicles, particularly the Clean Cities 
project, which Colorado has been part of, which developed a 
comprehensive EV and EV supply equipment readiness and 
implementation plan for our State.
    Now, there is another account under fossil fuels that I 
particularly think should be cut, and that is the one that 
works on oil shale formations with less than 50,000 barrels per 
day, and frankly, oil shale is one of the most dirty extraction 
methods out there, and, in fact, the distillation process 
releases pollutants into the air, including sulfur dioxide, 
lead, nitrogen oxides. In addition, it uses enormous amounts of 
water. The BLM reported that mining and distilling oil shale 
requires 2.1 to 5.2 barrels of water for each barrel of oil 
produced. Water is scarce across my home State of Colorado. 
Driving up cost for consumers and farmers is not the answer and 
not something that this committee should invest in making a 
reality.
    Finally, I have another cut. I would like to ask that you 
address the accelerated timeline of the W80-4 nuclear warhead. 
In 2015, I joined with my colleague, Mr. Quigley, to offer an 
amendment that would save $165 million in taxpayer money by 
placing development of the W80-4 nuclear warhead back to its 
original acquisition schedule, simply rather than accelerating 
it.
    The existing air launched cruise missile and warhead isn't 
being phased out until the 2030s. There is no risk of having a 
gap, a capabilities gap. Yet, the 2015 budget sped up the 
development for the warhead by 2 years to 2025. Fitting the 
W80-4 nuclear warhead onto the next generation long-range 
cruise missiles will free up $165 million to put towards 
reducing the definite and cutting your line item. At a time 
when the budgets are tight, that is very important.
    We already have the nuclear scientists disagree on whether 
our nuclear capability is enough to destroy life on the planet 
five or seven times. Frankly, I would advocate even deeper cuts 
in our nuclear capabilities. I would argue that a sufficient 
deterrent should be blowing up the world once. If you really 
want to blow up the world twice to be sure, you can do that, 
but we certainly don't need to blow up the world five to seven 
times. It is really redundant in terms of offering a 
deterrence, so that would be another excellent line item to 
look at cutting as your committee goes about its important work 
to save taxpayer money. I am happy to yield for any questions.

                                WITNESS
HON. BILL HUIZENGA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
    MICHIGAN
    Mr. Huizenga. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. Good to be here. Thank you.
    Mr. Huizenga. It is very good to be here. We are all set.
    Mr. Simpson. Yours for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Huizenga. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I deeply 
appreciate the opportunity to be here in front of you, and 
Ranking Member Kaptur as well, and the rest of the members of 
the committee. This is, I think, a very important issue and why 
I come before you today.
    I have been very grateful for our work together over the 
last number of years in efforts to increase the Army Corps of 
Engineers' harbor maintenance funding, and I think it is 
important to note that the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 
2016 allocated $1.263 billion for harbor maintenance, meeting 
of the congressional target overwhelmingly supported from the 
Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, and I thank 
you for that--that work on that.
    And while I do believe that that is a very strong step in 
the right direction, the funding level will represent only 69 
percent of the harbor maintenance taxes actually collected, and 
I believe that full use of the harbor maintenance trust fund is 
urgently needed to support critical maritime economic activity, 
especially as we are talking about increasing our 
infrastructure needs here in the United States, or addressing 
our infrastructure needs here in the United States. And through 
that glide path that was established in WRRDA, Congress 
committed to achieve full use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust 
Fund through incremental increases over a 10-year period.
    It is in this spirit that I urge the House Appropriations 
Committee to stay on a path to full utilization of the Trust 
Fund and to allocate 1.333 billion for harbor maintenance in 
fiscal year 2018. That figure would represent 74 percent of the 
estimated harbor maintenance taxes collected this past year in 
2017.
    And during my first year in Congress, our ports and 
navigation channels were maintained at just 47 percent of the 
revenue collected through the HMFT, and having a 74 percent 
target, obviously, would show just how far that we have come. 
And by following the authorized glide path, we stopped adding 
to the maintenance dredging backlog. We had had a growing 
backlog of harbors that needed to be maintained; however, much 
more work does need to be done, and I should point that--point 
out that oftentimes, the Great Lakes doesn't think of--isn't 
thought of as coastal, or as shipping, or important, but it is 
a multibillion dollar blue economy that those of us in the 
Great Lakes region experience every day, and we know the vital 
importance of having those ports for the economic vitality not 
only of our States or our region, but frankly, our country and 
our standing throughout the world.
    And it was with great pleasure that I had a chance to work 
with Janice Hahn, previously from Los Angeles on this issue, 
and it was sort of strange bedfellows that had come together on 
that, but we made a good team because we were able to make that 
argument for the entire country.
    Well, tomorrow, the American Society for Civil Engineers 
will issue their infrastructure report card, and their last 
report card gave our water freight movement infrastructure a D 
for navigation channels, and a B for our ports, and tomorrow's 
grade, we anticipate, will frankly show very few improvements. 
The inefficiencies resulting from poorly maintained harbors 
drive up the cost of U.S. exports and imports, which threaten 
U.S. economic growth, and we can't sell more Made-in-America 
products, frankly, if we can't have them leave our harbors.
    And while many transportation infrastructure programs are 
struggling to identify beneficiary paid revenue streams to meet 
those needs, maritime commerce has been paying enough to meet 
the operations and maintenance of all Federally-authorized 
harbors for decades. In fact, this funding is especially vital 
for 140 Federally maintained commercial and recreational ports 
and harbors in the Great Lakes, many of which are facing a 
crisis. In fact, 92 of those harbors have not been Federally 
maintained in years because of a lack of funding directed in 
that area.
    At the same time, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund has a 
balance of nearly $10 billion, and I believe that instead of 
increasing the balance of the Trust Fund or spending the money 
elsewhere, I urge you to dedicate our Harbor Maintenance Trust 
Fund tax revenue for its intended purpose, and enough of that 
has been collected, as I had said, that we would be able to 
deal with those harbors throughout the country, ranging from 
the Pacific Northwest to the Gulf Coast to the Port of Long 
Beach to Muskegon, Michigan, which is in my district.
    So Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur, and the rest 
of the members, I really do appreciate this opportunity to be 
in front of you today and to make our case. Thank you.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you for you testimony, Bill, and thank 
you for your past work on the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. We 
have had many discussions on this and how we can address it. 
And as you know, I am a supporter of trying to be able to use 
the full breadth of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, and 
somehow relieve it from the budget caps and the weird budgeting 
rules we sometimes create for ourselves, because if you are 
only using 74 percent of it and you still have a need out there 
that means you took 26 percent in the bank----
    Mr. Huizenga. Yeah.
    Mr. Simpson [continuing]. And not using it to address the 
need that you are taxing for us, so it just doesn't make sense. 
But we still have a ways to go into convincing some of our 
colleagues that we need to take it off budget, but still 
subject to appropriation. So I appreciate your work on that.
    Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that, 
and I look forward to working with you and the ranking member 
on this issue continually, so thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. Further questions?
    Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to thank 
Congressman Huizenga for testifying today and being a very 
strong advocate for proper investment in our ports and 
waterways, and particularly because the waterborne commerce and 
transport is the most cost effective means of moving both cargo 
and people. I guess I have often wondered why we haven't paid 
more attention to that. We seem to figure out, well, at least 
partly, how to do roads and bridges, but when it comes to 
waterborne with our four coasts, we often neglect the Great 
Lakes, in particular, so I just thank you very much for coming 
and testifying today, and I know that our chairman is very open 
to working on both sides of the aisle, and hopefully we will 
make a difference this year on the Harbor Maintenance Trust 
Fund. Thank you.
    Mr. Huizenga. All right. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you for appearing here today. 
Congressman Diaz Barragan. Is that right? Did I pronounce that 
correctly?

                                WITNESS
HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE 
    OF CALIFORNIA
    Ms. Barragan. Yes.
    Mr. Simpson. Okay. The floor is yours.
    Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Chairman Simpson, Ranking Member 
Kaptur, and members of the Energy and Water Subcommittee. I 
want to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak to 
you this morning. I am going to echo some of my colleague that 
we just heard from.
    I represent California's 44th Congressional District. It is 
the seat that used to be held by Janice Hahn. It includes areas 
like San Pedro, Compton, and Watts, and it, most notably, has 
the Port of Los Angeles in the district. It is North America's 
largest seaport by container volume and cargo value, and I am 
proud to have that in my district.
    I am proud to represent the thousands of workers that are 
directly and indirectly associated with the Port of Los 
Angeles. It is the largest economic engine in the region, and 
it touches every single congressional district in this country. 
The San Pedro Bay Ports Complex, which includes both the Port 
of L.A. and Long Beach, accounts for one-quarter of the 
Nation's cargo and supports over 3 million jobs nationwide. As 
we mentioned, the goods that pass through the San Pedro Bay 
Port Complex touch nearly every facet of this country.
    In 2016, the Port of L.A. had its best year in its 110-year 
history. As our economy grows--continues to grow, so do the 
size of vessels and freight volumes. When you couple these 
factors with growing international competition and the fact 
that the American Society of Civil Engineers gave our ports a C 
in their report card, it is apparent that more must be done to 
improve our infrastructure for ports and harbors.
    My message today is simple: I urge this esteemed 
subcommittee to fund the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' 
navigation program at $2.9 billion for fiscal year 2018 and 
2017. Specifically, I urge you to fund the donor ports at $50 
million, and to hit the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
expenditure targets for both fiscal years 2018 and 2017, so 
that we can remain on the path to utilize 100 percent of the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund revenues by fiscal year 2025 and 
thereafter.
    In June of 2014, the bipartisan Water Resources Reform and 
Development Act, also known as WRRDA, was enacted into law. You 
know, one of the most thoughtful provisions of this law was 
section 2106, which expand the use of the Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund for donor ports, for ports such as Los Angeles. As 
you know, in the case of donor ports, Harbor Maintenance Funds 
do not return to the States and harbors where the taxes are 
collected.
    For example, in California, California receives only 15 
percent back of what the shippers at our harbors pay into the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The San Pedro Bay Ports Complex 
is among the largest collectors of Harbor Maintenance tax funds 
with an average of $200 million each year, but we receive only 
1 percent back.
    Section 2106 of WRRDA addresses some of these tax fairness 
and donor equity issues. The section also authorized 
appropriations of $50 million for each of the fiscal year's 
2015 through 2018. Donor ports are authorized to use these 
discretionary funds for expanded uses, including berths and 
dredging of contaminated sediments, environmental remediation, 
or payments to importers or shippers transporting cargo through 
that port.
    The section 2101 of WRRDA see targets expenditures from the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund increasing each year so that 
fiscal year 2025 and each thereafter, 100 percent of the taxes 
collected will go towards the intended purpose and operation of 
maintenance activities.
    A full utilization of the Harbor Maintenance tax will only 
occur, however, if the level of appropriations for the Civil 
Works Program of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is at the 
fiscal year is increased.
    In fiscal year 2016, Congress appropriated $25 million in 
donor ports, of which slightly over $3 million were allocated 
to the Port of Los Angeles for critical berth maintenance 
dredging. For fiscal year 2017, the Senate bill contained $50 
million for donor ports, while the House bill only contained 
$10 million.
    I urge the subcommittee to help our Nation stay 
internationally competitive by funding donor ports at $50 
million for both fiscal years 2018 and 2017, and to hit the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund expenditure targets. I thank you, 
again, for the opportunity to speak before you today.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you for your testimony. Are there 
questions? Ken.
    Mr. Calvert. Yeah, I appreciate your coming in and 
testifying. I knew your predecessor quite well. We had those 
discussions often about the Harbor Maintenance account, and 
also about maybe expanding the definition of the Harbor 
Maintenance account to go beyond the port facility because part 
of the problem with a part of--on the part of the Port of L.A./
Long Beach, is getting the freight out and down the Alameda 
corridor, which we never really completed east of Los Angeles 
and down to the--and down and out of the L.A. Basin and through 
the Inland Empire, where we can move that freight out because 
right now, we just have an overload of freight that is backed 
up along the main rail corridors, and a lot of that is grade 
separations and the rest that need to be improved.
    So maybe in the future, Mr. Chairman, we can work together 
on what the Congresswoman brought up, and also about the 
improvements on those rail lines. Mr. Aguilar has the same 
problem in his district, so it is an issue that we need to 
address.
    Mr. Simpson. I appreciate that and would be happy to work 
with you on it. Thank you for you testimony.
    Ms. Barragan. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. You bet. Congressman Crawford.
                              ----------

                                WITNESS
HON. ERIC A. ``RICK'' CRAWFORD, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE 
    STATE OF ARKANSAS
    Mr. Crawford. Yes, sir. Chairman Simpson, Ranking Member 
Kaptur, and members of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, thank 
you for allowing me to appear before you today to provide 
testimony on the importance of Army Corps of Engineer project 
funding to the First District of Arkansas.
    As you know, the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project, 
or MR&amp;T, is the largest flood control project in the world. 
MR&amp;T plays an integral role in protecting the Lower Mississippi 
Valley from devastating floods and enables continuous 
navigation along the Mississippi River and its tributaries.
    Since its inception in 1928, taxpayers have received a $46 
return for every dollar invested in this project, while 
preventing $612 billion in flood damages and protecting 4 
million residents of the Lower Mississippi River Valley. MR&amp;T 
also promotes navigation along the river and its tributaries, 
and helps support a vibrant and agriculture economy. Over 500 
million tons of cargo move on the Mississippi River system each 
year, saving billions of dollars in domestic transportation 
costs, and giving U.S. businesses a competitive advantage in 
the global marketplace.
    I appreciate the continued support this subcommittee 
provides for MR&amp;T, and I understand that our current fiscal 
environment forces us to carefully evaluate where each dollar 
goes. For MR&amp;T to meet its current challenges, an increase in 
funding over the current CR funding level of $290 million is 
needed for the program to reach its full capability to protect 
lives, property, and to support commerce.
    To achieve its objectives, MR&amp;T requires funding of 
approximately $500 million. While I recognize the challenging 
environment of fiscal restraint, I believe that Congress must 
prioritize the projects that provide taxpayers the best return 
on their investment. There are few government-funded programs 
that can boast a 46-to-1 return.
    MR&amp;T also supports critical water supply projects needed to 
alleviate the alarming rate of aquifer depletion in the mid-
south region. Examples include the Grand Prairie and Bayou Meto 
surface water projects that are currently under construction in 
my district. These projects are critical infrastructure 
investments designed to address the depletion of the Alluvial 
and Sparta aquifers. The loss of these aquifers would not only 
result in a severe disruption in the agriculture economy of the 
Delta region, but municipal and other industrial water uses 
would also be severely impacted.
    The U.S. Army Corps predicts the Alluvial aquifer will be 
commercially useless in the near future, and as a result, 66 
percent of the Bayou Meto project area will no longer have 
access to irrigation, while 77 percent of the Grand Prairie 
project will no longer be able to irrigate.
    Unless we deal with this problem now, there will be water 
crisis in the future that will strike a severe blow to the 
economy and quality of life in the already distressed Arkansas 
Delta region. I imagine many of the members of the subcommittee 
face groundwater problems in the districts they represent, but 
it is important to note that unlike many Western States, the 
State of Arkansas does not have access to targeted Federal 
groundwater protection programs such as those operated by the 
Bureau of Reclamation.
    Quite simply, there are no viable alternatives available to 
my constituents. While we have not yet seen a detailed fiscal 
year 2018 presidential budget, I am requesting this committee 
work with me and my staff to find ways to provide water 
infrastructure projects and adequate funding stream, including 
potentially revising the report language that authorized 
expenditures for ongoing work under the MR&amp;T budget.
    Last year, the water supply projects in my strict barely 
received enough funding to satisfy existing contractual 
obligations and staffing needs. Hardly any progress was made on 
project construction, and we currently find ourselves in a 
protracted holding pattern with no end in sight. The longer the 
construction process is drawn out, the more costly these 
projects become to the taxpayer. The current rate of progress 
is unsustainable.
    I understand that the Appropriations Committee has limited 
resources available, and I certainly applaud the work you are 
doing to support critical water infrastructure projects. I am 
very grateful for the subcommittee's continued support for the 
Army Corps' vital work in the Lower Mississippi River Valley. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me or my staff as you work 
through the fiscal year 2018 appropriations process, and I 
thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you for being here today. Questions?
    Ms. Kaptur. I do have a question, Mr. Chairman, of 
Representative Crawford, and that is I am from the State of 
Ohio, and the entire Great Lakes system is threatened by 
something called the Asian carp.
    Mr. Crawford. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Kaptur. How do you look upon that issue in your part of 
our country?
    Mr. Crawford. Well, it is actually a very challenging 
issue, and unfortunately, the introduction of the Asian carp 
came about as a result of Fish and Wildlife and a management 
decision they made down in my neck of the woods and without the 
knowledge of what could happen, and now we see them invading 
the Great Lakes. They are a very prolific reproductive species.
    We are looking at potential commercial uses to harvest the 
Asian carp and find some--find a market in China. There is 
actually a market for that fish, and there are other markets 
available, but it is going to continue to be a challenging 
problem for us, not only in the Lower Mississippi, but as you 
have seen, it has migrated north into your area.
    Ms. Kaptur. We have to deal with it in your part of the 
country in order to prevent it spreading north.
    Mr. Crawford. Absolutely.
    Ms. Kaptur. And I know there are different actions being 
undertaken, but it is completely frightening to our maritime--
--
    Mr. Crawford. It absolutely is.
    Ms. Kaptur [continuing]. And recreational activities up in 
the Great Lakes.
    Mr. Crawford. Well, they are dangerous, quite frankly. They 
pose a physical threat. I mean, they can jump into the boat, if 
that is not bad enough, and they do that routinely. But there 
have been documented cases of severe harm and, even death, by 
hitting individuals on boats because they are big and they are 
pretty aggressive feeders.
    Ms. Kaptur. I would hope Representative Crawford and our 
chairman, who has always been open to our concerns, as we look 
at this entire Mississippi River corridor, that we assure the 
various departments and agencies that the State and Federal 
levels are doing a better job because that is really coming 
north.
    Mr. Crawford. I am glad you brought that up because it 
certainly is a challenge for us, and in my geography, and it is 
not stopping there.
    Ms. Kaptur. We almost need an Asian carp task force that--
along the entire length of the Mississippi.
    Mr. Crawford. That is not a bad idea, and I would be 
willing to serve on that if such a task force were stood up.
    Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. You have experienced them first. All 
right. Thank you so very much. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Crawford, for being 
here today, and we will certainly look forward to working with 
you and your staff when we start putting this thing together. 
Thank you.
    Mr. Green, welcome.

                                WITNESS
HON. GENE GREEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS
    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ranking member and 
members of the committee. I want----
    Mr. Simpson. Could you turn your microphone on?
    Mr. Green. Because over my years in Congress, we have 
worked together on a lot of issues. I represent a very urban 
district in Houston, but it includes about half of the Port of 
Houston, and I appreciate your consideration over the last 25 
years or so.
    Our district is home to the Port of Houston. I share that 
with Congressman Brian Babin, and the Port of Houston is one 
of--the number one export terminal in the country. Our port is 
the major economic engine for eastern Harris County in Texas, 
responsible for over 56,000 direct jobs, and over $5 billion in 
State and local tax revenue from business related to the port.
    In order for the Port of Houston and other port facilities 
in the United States to grow and support economic activity 
throughout the country, it is critical for Congress to 
significantly increase funding for the maintenance and dredging 
operations for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for fiscal year 
2018. Increasing funding to the Corps--Army Corps civil works 
operations and maintenance account is the only way to ensure 
that the Port of Houston is dredged to the authorized depth of 
45 foot, and will be able to accommodate the post-Panamax 
vessels that are larger and are becoming the international norm 
for maritime container shipping. The same is true to ports 
along the Gulf Coast, the Atlantic seaboard, who rely on the 
Army Corps, dredging to keep our terminals open for business.
    The other issue in our district and neighboring communities 
in Harris County surrounding are severely impacted by flooding 
in recent years. In the past 2 years, the greater Houston 
region has suffered from two catastrophic flood events on 
Memorial Day of 2015, and as we call it Tax Day of last year, 
2016, that killed 17 local residents and caused billions of 
dollars in damages.
    In fact, many people in Houston directly affected by the 
2016 Tax Day flood have only recently recovered from the 
previous year's flood. In response to the growing frequency of 
catastrophic flooding in the Houston, Harris County, my 
colleagues, Congressman Al Green, Congressman John Culberson, 
and I, along with 100 other Members of Congress, introduced 
legislation last year to authorize $311 million in emergency 
appropriations for flood control projects. That $311 million, 
or the projects that have been approved by the Corps, but we 
haven't been able to fund, and again, we share 10 Members of 
Congress around the Houston area, and flooding doesn't matter. 
It gets all of us because we are the coastal plain, and I have 
bayous and rivers that go through my area, and we are fortunate 
to have them, although they do silt up our port, too. That is 
why we have to dredge.
    The legislation was not enacted, and--but it showed the 
support, and I would urge the subcommittee to significantly 
increase the Corps of Engineers' Flood Control and Coastal 
Emergencies Account. A robust increase in Corps--Army Corps 
flood projects would greatly benefit communities in Houston and 
along the Gulf Coast who live in constant fear when the next 
flood will strike and save billions of dollars in property 
protected from flood damage.
    And again, I want to thank you for the opportunity to 
testify, and, again, thank you for the relationship our--I have 
had with this subcommittee for many years. I would be glad to 
answer any questions.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Congressman. I appreciate you being 
here today, and I know you have got a tough area down there 
with all the floods that has going on lately, and we look 
forward to working with you and the other Members from that 
area to try and address those concerns.
    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Kaptur. I just----
    Mr. Simpson. Questions?
    Ms. Kaptur [continuing]. Want to echo the chairman's words 
there. Frankly, Houston has just been battered, your coastline 
over and over. I really congratulate your community, your 
citizenry for their stalwartness in face of all of that, and I 
know we will try to do everything we can to help.
    Mr. Green. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you for being here today.
    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

HON. EARL L. ``BUDDY'' CARTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE 
    STATE OF GEORGIA
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it is an honor to 
be with you, and I thank all the committee members. I 
appreciate this opportunity to share my priorities and concerns 
for the First Congressional District of Georgia. It is an honor 
to represent a district that is so geographically diverse and 
rich in water resources. I look forward to working with you, 
Mr. Chairman, and the Energy and Water Subcommittee, to address 
a number of different challenges we are currently facing.
    I would like to start by saying thank you. Thank you for 
your continued commitment to working with us to complete SHEP, 
the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project. As you know, it is the 
most exhaustively studied, deep-draft project in the Nation and 
represents a significant economic opportunity not just for 
coastal Georgia and the surrounding areas, but for the region 
as a whole. Under the Corps of Engineers' original cost 
estimate, the Federal Government's share would need to be 
roughly $100 million annually to keep the project on track and 
on budget.
    It is these major deep-draft navigational projects that 
will be the stimulus for growing our economy. For this reason, 
I am respectfully supporting a funding request that would 
ensure robust funding for the construction of deep-draft 
navigation projects across the country.
    We are also fortunate to have one of the busiest roll-on/
roll-off ports in the Nation. The Port of Brunswick has also 
seen tremendous growth with the majority of their increase 
being roll-on/roll-off in bulk cargo. While this is great news, 
it is not without difficulties. For years, we have worked with 
Corps of Engineers and the Georgia Ports Authority to deepen 
the river to authorize maintenance depth, but the Federal 
funding has been below needed levels.
    In addition, compounding shoaling and natural disasters 
have created additional challenges for the operators of these 
ships. As a result, I am supporting the need for better funding 
for maintenance projects across the Nation. With needed 
attention towards our Nation's operations and maintenance 
needs, we can keep our water-based infrastructure projects on 
track.
    While I have touched on these two major ports, the issue of 
harbor maintenance is a concern that both this subcommittee and 
authorizers have addressed before with the Harbor Maintenance 
Trust Fund. As we seek to grow our economy, we need to have 
ports that can sustain adequate depths as we transition to the 
larger vessels making calls.
    I know, Mr. Chairman, that you remain committed to finding 
a solution to this problem, and I look forward to working with 
you to remedy this situation. In addition to the previously 
mentioned projects, the Tybee Island Shore Protection Project 
is vital to protecting and sustaining the measures needed to 
keep the residents of Tybee Island safe from further severe 
weather events.
    The recent damage caused by Hurricane Matthew was mitigated 
thanks to the dune protections that were in place. Phase 2 of 
the Savannah Channel Impact Study is important to assessing 
erosion along the shoreline, and to determine the steps 
necessary to reduce the impacts of future severe weather 
events.
    I support sufficient funding under Additional Funding, 
Shore Protection Investigations, to ensure that Tybee Island, 
like many other communities, has the protection it needs to 
survive another disaster.
    Mr. Chairman, I am extremely appreciative of the hard work 
that you and your colleagues on the subcommittee do in crafting 
the Energy and Waters Appropriations bill as we discuss 
infrastructure development and ways to stimulate our economy, 
and we need to look no further than the water-based 
infrastructure stimulating global trade. I deeply appreciate 
your attention to these matters, and thank you for the 
opportunity to provide this input.
    Again, Mr. Chairman, I thank all of you for your work, you 
and your committee members for your work. These deep-draft 
navigational ports are extremely important, as you know, and I 
am not exaggerating when I say that SHEP, the Savannah Harbor 
Expansion Project, is the most, without question, the most 
investigated project that we have ever had. It is the most 
exhaustively studied deep water project that we have had. We 
have been doing this now for going on 20 years, and still 
haven't completed that project.
    This is funding that we desperately need, not for the First 
District of Georgia, not only for the State of Georgia but for 
the whole southeast United States. This is an impact that we 
can have on the whole southeastern portion of the United 
States. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank all of the 
committee members.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you for being here today, Mr. Carter. We 
appreciate it very much. Other questions?
    Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to ask 
Congressman Carter--thank you for your excellent testimony.
    Mr. Carter. Sure.
    Ms. Kaptur. Could you just explain to us who don't come 
from your part of the country, how the changing nature of the 
ecosystem, the weather and everything has impacted your area? 
You talked about shoaling up, you talked about silting up, what 
is going on? In a bigger sense rather than just the port, the 
deep water port, what is happening in the region?
    Mr. Carter. Well, keep in mind where we are. If you know 
the geography of the United States, Savannah is somewhat 
inland. Remember that the--Florida comes up and then it kind of 
shifts east and goes--and the eastern shoreline goes up, so 
Savannah is accessible to more areas within the southeast, just 
because of our location on the coast.
    We are more inland than the outer ports are, and that 
causes some problems, in and of itself, when you talk about 
some of the geographical problems that we have and some of the 
changes that we have, and particularly in the weather. It is 
both advantageous, and, at the same time, it can be a hindrance 
to us. It is advantageous because it makes us closer to a lot 
of the geographical areas and a lot of cities along the eastern 
seaboard, along the eastern United States. We don't have to 
travel as far to get there, but at the same time, it does cause 
a lot of silting and a lot of filling in of our ports, and we 
have to have a lot more maintenance.
    Ms. Kaptur. Is there more wave action, or what is 
happening?
    Mr. Carter. There is. Our tide shift in this particular 
area is more than just about anywhere else in the United 
States. We have alternating tides. We have tide shifts of 7, 8 
feet at times, and that is just unheard of in other areas in 
the country.
    Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. If there are no other questions, 
thank you, Mr. Carter. We appreciate it. We look forward to 
working with you on your----
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you 
especially, and your help on this and all the committee 
members.
    Mr. Simpson. You bet. Mr. Johnson, thank you for being here 
today.

                                WITNESS
HON. MIKE JOHNSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
    LOUISIANA
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Chairman Simpson, and Ranking 
Member Kaptur, and my colleagues and distinguished members of 
the subcommittee. I want to thank you for this opportunity to 
testify in front of the Energy and Water Development 
</option>
    <option>Subcommittee on the importance of developing and maintaining</option>
    <option>Louisiana and the Nation's water infrastructure needs.
    Today, I ask the committee to help fund dredging needs that 
will provide much-needed resources related to flooding and 
navigation benefit, and not forget the tremendous benefit that 
shallow draft waterways and ports have in bringing jobs back to 
the United States.
    The role our inland waterway systems play is an integral 
part of our Nation's maritime system, and it is critically 
important to our prosperity as a country. In my district, 
Louisiana's Fourth District, some our biggest challenges and 
yet some of our greatest opportunities revolve around port 
infrastructure and further development of the navigation of our 
rivers.
    We have four shallow draft port authorities which service 
485 miles of navigable waterways and shallow draft river miles. 
As many of you are aware, the Red River in northwest Louisiana 
experienced an historic flood, even in June of 2015, which 
affected 21 of our parishes. This flood, along with a series of 
other recent flooding events, have significantly damaged our 
navigation structures, and they are currently threatening the 
maintenance of the channel and the safety of our residents.
    An immediate issue that was identified was how far off the 
actual river's flood stage crest was from the projected crest, 
which is based on a 1990 flood of record. The flood crest in 
2015 was significantly higher than the flood crest in 1990, 
with less volume of water measured at the Shreveport gauge, 
which is our primary gauge there. The higher flood stage caused 
significant damage to homes and agricultural land and 
businesses, our oil and gas industry, and our public 
infrastructures.
    In order to determine the reasons for these discrepancies, 
a sedimentation survey and hydraulic model from the Army Corps 
of Engineers is necessary. The $1.5 million study is authorized 
under the existing J. Bennett Johnson Waterway Project, 
Construction's General Account. Unfortunately, only $250,000 
was allocated in fiscal year 2016. Robust funding is 
desperately needed to help projects such as this come to 
fruition.
    If this survey and the model are not completed and 
analyzed, the 350,000 acres, and approximately 58,000 residents 
of the area, will continue to suffer from future flood events. 
It is imminent.
    A second major issue concerns the protection of our major 
infrastructure. River levels have come within feet of entering 
many structures in Bossier City on the other side of the river 
from Shreveport. Due to the damaged river profile, it is highly 
likely that levees need to be raised and flood walls 
constructed to protect existing infrastructure.
    FEMA has stated that the Federal methods used to regulate 
development of the special flood hazard areas would have to be 
reevaluated due to ongoing discrepancies, which were on full 
display during the 2015 flood event. However, in true-to-form 
fashion, FEMA cannot provide a final base flood elevation, or 
BFE, or a flood insurance rate map, FIRM, it can't do those 
updates without the Corps' sedimentation study and the 
hydraulic model.
    Funding the sedimentation survey would allow FEMA to do 
their job, and, thus, further protect the people of Louisiana 
by completing updates to the BFE and the FIRM. In addition to 
these studies, the Red River has several other immediate items 
which were in need of Federal action and funding. I ask the 
committee to continue to work with me on the ongoing needs 
related to dredging so that river navigation for a 24/7 
industry can be maintained.
    These funding priorities will not only help protect 
constituents, but it will improve business development for 
opportunities not only for Louisiana, but also Texas and 
Arkansas. Navigation funds through the Corps are truly needed 
to ensure and maintain a 9-by-200 foot channel. Without this, 
businesses will not only take elsewhere to invest, those that 
already have invested in north Louisiana will probably leave.
    The planned goal is to get a 12-foot river depth to ensure 
adequate competition with nearby rivers, such as the 
Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers. A request for an investigation 
to change the authorized depth from a 9-foot to a 12-foot 
channel has been initiated. Repair for damaged buoys, locks, 
and levees along the Red River are also needed.
    The construction features of the J. Bennett Johnston 
Waterway Project are only 93 percent complete. The Alexandria 
Front Dike Reinforcement Construction project and the J.H. 
Overton Lock &amp; Dam 2 Lower Approach project are examples of two 
that can compete for funding with the construction general 
account resources for these projects, and those will help to 
aid in completion of the J. Bennett Johnston Waterway.
    A final example of where navigation funds are needed is the 
Ouchita-Black Rivers Navigation project. Previously, the fiscal 
year 2017 budget request for the navigation project was 8.5 
million, and additional maintenance account funds will allow 
this project to compete for the additional funds necessary to 
keep the waterway open for commercial navigation in the next 
year.
    I am out of time. I just want to strongly urge this 
subcommittee to invest in our ports and waterways so that our 
local communities can continue to build vibrant economies, and 
I stand ready to work with each of you and the administration 
in developing meaningful solutions to better maintain and 
enhance our Nations's vast water infrastructure system. And I 
am grateful for your time and your diligence on all these 
important needs.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. I appreciate you being 
here today.
    Mr. Johnson. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Simpson. Other questions?
    Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Chairman, I gather we don't have another 
witness right away, so I am just going to take 30 seconds to--
--
    Mr. Simpson. Okay.
    Ms. Kaptur [continuing]. Thank Congressman Johnson very 
much but to ask you if you have any theories about why the 
flood crest in 2015 was significantly higher than the flood 
crest in 1990. What is happening in your part of North America?
    Mr. Johnson. It is an excellent question, and the subject 
of much conjecture in our district. The prevailing theory seems 
to be that sedimentation has settled on the bed of the river, 
and that the Army Corps did not take that into account when 
they set that flood level, and so it is a substantial rise.
    We have lots of sedimentation on the Red River, and it has 
just built up over time, and so it was just something no one 
factored in apparently, as crazy as that sounds, and it was a 
gross underestimation. The--combine this flood with the flood 
that we had in south Louisiana several months later, we had the 
fourth most costly flood crises in American history in our 
State, and we are struggling to recover so----
    Ms. Kaptur. Are you getting more rainfall?
    Mr. Johnson. Let's hope not catastrophic levels.
    Ms. Kaptur. I guess what I am saying, are you getting more 
rainfall in shorter periods of time or larger volumes of 
rainfall? Is that contributing to the problem or not?
    Mr. Johnson. I don't know that that has been assessed to be 
the problem. I know there was an historic rainfall event in 
States just to our north, and, of course, it flowed down to us. 
And so it wasn't even really the rainfall levels in northwest 
Louisiana that caught us; it was rainfall in Missouri and 
Oklahoma and other areas, and it just came to us.
    We are doing our best to prepare for future events, and we 
are deeply concerned, pun not intended, that we could have a 
catastrophic event if these things happen again, so----
    Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Thank you for being here today. We 
appreciate your testimony, and we look forward to working with 
you and your staff.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you so much.
    Mr. Simpson. You bet. We are going to be in recess for just 
a few minutes. We have three more people that are here to 
testify, and they should be here shortly. We should be done in 
the next 25 minutes or so when they get here, so we will take a 
brief recess until they come.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Simpson. The committee will be back in order. Thank 
you, Mr. Wilson, for being here. We look forward to your 
testimony today. The floor is yours.

                                WITNESS
HON. JOE WILSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH 
    CAROLINA
    Mr. Wilson. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and with Ranking 
Member Kaptur, what an honor to be here with both of you. This 
is kind of a show of bright faces here. Thank you. And then, 
excuse me, Congressman Fleischmann, too. I was not anticipating 
such extraordinary people, so thank you very much. I appreciate 
the opportunity to meet with you today.
    First, I would like to thank Chairman Mike Simpson for his 
leadership as chairman of the House Appropriation Subcommittee 
on Energy and Water. I am grateful to represent South 
Carolina's Second Congressional District, a diverse and 
thriving community that is home to vital national security 
environmental cleanup missions.
    Today, I will specifically address the necessity of fully 
resourcing the very positive and proven missions at the 
Savannah River site and the Aiken-Barnwell community that I 
represent adjacent to Augusta, Georgia. The Savannah River site 
is home to the mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility, MOX 
facility, a valuable part of our nonproliferation and nuclear 
security. The MOX facility is currently 70 percent completed, 
and when completed, will be the Nation's only facility that can 
convert weapons grade plutonium into green fuel. The--and bring 
the United States back in compliance with our international 
nonproliferation agreements.
    I am confident that after examining MOX with clear unbiased 
data, it will be apparent that completing MOX is in the best 
interest of our national security. The Savannah River National 
Laboratory conducts cutting edge research supporting our 
Nation's ability to produce tritium, to monitor and detect 
capabilities for nuclear nonproliferation, and to conduct 
nuclear forensics. It researches and provides improved 
technologies for safely storing and transporting high-level 
radioactive waste.
    Additionally, the laboratory continues to make advancements 
in electrical grid security, studying electromagnetic pulses, 
EMPs. The Savannah River site is home to other critical 
Department of Energy nuclear security and environmental cleanup 
missions as it safely processes Cold War era nuclear materials 
into stable materials that can be stored for later disposal.
    Last year, the site completed construction of the salt 
waste processing facility, greatly enhancing the speed and 
efficiency of the remediation of high-level waste. Other 
critical facilities include H-Canyon, the Nation's only 
production scale nuclear chemical separations plant, and both K 
and L areas where--which safely store nuclear materials.
    Now, all the missions at the Savannah River site are vital 
to bolstering our national security capability and safe 
environmental stewardship.
    Since 1952, the Savannah River site has played a critical 
role in processing and disposing of high-level defense waste. 
However, the Savannah River site was never intended to be a 
long-term option for high-level waste. It lacks the ability to 
serve as a permanent repository. The only viable permanent 
repository is Yucca Mountain, which is environmentally secure.
    I strongly urge the Appropriations Committee to allocate 
funding specifically for the completion of Yucca Mountain 
license application. Abandoning Yucca Mountain in favor of a 
nonexistent alternative would leave the communities across the 
United States, including the South Carolina-Georgia Central 
Savannah River region to bear the burden of storing nuclear 
waste the Federal Government has promised to remove.
    Additionally, American ratepayers have put enormous 
resources to completing the nuclear storage facility at Yucca 
Mountain, including $1.5 billion from the ratepayers of South 
Carolina. I believe that the completion of the license 
application will highlight the technical merits and alleviate 
any environmental concerns for its neighbors.
    I appreciate the difficult decisions the committee must 
make as we begin the appropriations process for fiscal year 
2018. Thank you for your time. I urge you to continue 
supporting the vital missions at the Savannah River site and at 
Yucca Mountain. Thank you and would be happy to answer any 
questions.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Congressman Wilson.
    Mr. Fleischmann.
    Mr. Fleischmann. Yes. Congressman Wilson, I want to thank 
you for your advocacy today, and also, to let everyone here 
know, the EM mission nationally is so critically important. I 
know Savannah River has a project, Idaho has a project, 
Oakridge has literally decades worth of work, Hanford. We can 
literally look all across the country, and I would like to 
urge, as you have done, participation in our bipartisan nuclear 
cleanup caucus. It is one of the fastest growing caucuses in 
Congress. Ben Ray Lujan is my cochairman. We work very well 
together to advocate, and when a particular site has either had 
a deficiency or has a need, we have been able to address that 
in a very effective way.
    So thank you for your advocacy. Savannah River is a 
critically important site as is Oakridge, and I appreciate your 
testimony here today, sir.
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you very much. And indeed, it is so 
positive to me to see the working relationships between the 
various sites across the Nation. It is really inspiring to see 
how positive it is and look forward to working with Congressman 
Lujan, too. I have worked with him on a number of issues, and 
this can be bipartisan and positive for the national security 
of the people of the United States.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Wilson.
    Ms. Kaptur.
    Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. I just wanted also to thank 
Congressman Wilson for testifying today and bringing forward 
the importance of waste--nuclear waste disposal. I am hoping 
that in any new infrastructure bill that is proposed that the 
cleanup issues will be also considered for inclusion and both 
for the types of waste that you specify in your testimony as 
well as spent ordinance, which is a big problem in many places 
in the country and other ingredients that have been a part of 
our defense and nuclear complex.
    I think this could be a job creator. It is work that we 
have had backlogged on our accounts for years and years and 
years, and I think you could be an important voice in that. So 
along with the rest of us. So I just thank you very much for 
testifying this morning. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the 
time.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Thanks for your 
testimony, and we look forward to working with you on this 
year's budget.
    Mr. Wilson. Again, what leadership here. I am just honored 
to be in your presence. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Again we will be in brief recess 
until our next witness comes.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Simpson. The committee will be back in order. We are 
happy to have the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee with us today. I 
look forward to your testimony. The floor is yours.

                                WITNESS
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF 
    TEXAS
    Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much to Mr. Simpson and Ms. 
Kaptur. Thank you to this committee for its work that I think 
strikes an enormously bipartisan and nonpartisan cord, because 
all of us are concerned about major elements of clean water, 
clean air, and certainly energy for this Nation. So I wish to 
highlight the energy, water, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
programs, which warrant the committee's continued attention and 
support. I will speak quickly about some initial ones so that I 
can focus on something that I think you have seen me on the 
floor confronting, and that is the flooding in Houston, Harris 
County, and, certainly, flooding that we have seen over the 
last couple years around the country.
    First of all, I support the $1.26 billion for Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund. Particularly, Houston Port is a manmade 
port. We face these issues of continuing to have to maintain 
the port so that it is viable for the major vessels that come 
in. As you well know, through the opening of the Panama Canal 
in its full force, the Houston Port will become busier than 
ever, and the dredging that is necessary is crucial. We 
continue to debate the question of how much money we send to 
the United States and how much money we receive, but I support 
the $1.26 billion for the importance, if you will, the 
importance of helping not only the Houston Port, but around the 
Nation. I support the $230 million for the Weatherization 
Assistance Program. WAP helps low income seniors, and I support 
that greatly as it relates to their energy efficiency. I 
support $2 million for the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation 
Program, robust funding for the DOE's Wind Energy Program in 
the State of Texas. We have taken wings, if I might say that.
    The wind program is unbelievable to both the chairman and 
the ranking member. It is particularly outside of our urban 
centers. It is in our rural communities. Our farmers are 
welcoming the windmills and asking, how many more can be placed 
on my land while I continue to do my--the commitment to the 
agriculture business that I have? So I am really supportive of 
expanding this program as a continuing substitute, or 
complement, to energy needs in the United States.
    I support $2.9 billion for energy efficiency; $5.672 
billion for DOE Office of Science, in particular, working with 
the NIH and the President BRAIN Initiative, we will develop the 
next generation tools and technology to support research into 
the brain. I support $84 million for the National Network for 
Manufacturing; support $70 million for the State Energy 
Program.
    And now to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This is a 
lifeline in Harris County. We have the Harris County Flood 
Control District. We just had a report assessing that some of 
the work that we have done may have helped, or may be helping a 
neighborhood that has suffered flooding almost two years 
straight, with loss of life. And that is really striking in an 
urban area. This is a residential area where people were lost 
by their vehicles, either flooding into the bayou, which is 
what we have, or they themselves flooding into the bayou.
    One particularly sad incident was firefighters who rescued 
two seniors and another individual. These seniors had just from 
come the graduation of their granddaughter, and because the 
storms were so bad, the family said, why don't you head home, 
not wait till the program is over, and they, unfortunately, got 
flooded out, I think even as they were getting out of their 
car. They were rescued by firefighters, but the boat toppled 
over, and they--both of them lost their lives.
    So this is in the urban area of Houston. And so the Army 
Corps of Engineers does vital work. The appropriations funds 
studies to determine the need, engineering feasibility, and 
economic and environmental return to the Nation of potential 
solutions to water and related land-resource problems, pre-
construction engineering and design, and related data 
collection, interagency coordination research are very, very 
important. The Army Corps of Engineers plays a critical role, 
and it certainly is important to us.
    I was pleased that the fiscal year 2017 energy and water 
spending bill provided that the Secretary of the Army may 
initiate up to six new studies, and that five of those studies 
should be in areas where the majority of benefits are derived. 
I am optimistic that these provisions will be retained in 
fiscal year 2018, and that one of these new studies selected 
will be the Houston Regional Watershed Assessment Flood Risk 
and Management Feasibility Study that I have advocated for. 
Such a study is certainly needed to give the frequency and 
severity of historic level flood events in recent years in and 
around the historic Houston metropolitan area. I have asked for 
this for $3 million. We have never had a study of whether--how 
the bayous work together, and whether our improvements really 
work, and so this would be a great necessity.
    Let me quickly try to conclude by noting on April 15, 2016, 
an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in the Houston 
area over a 12-hour period, which resulted in several areas 
exceeding the 100- to 500-year flood area. The May 2015 Houston 
flood destroyed 3,015 homes, left eight persons dead. The 
economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated 
at $3 billion. The damage from 2016 is estimated at above $2 
billion. Not a hurricane; just rain. And our city is filled 
with bayous.
    So, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, minimizing the risk of 
flood damage to the Houston and Harris County metropolitan 
area, the Nation's fourth largest, is a matter of national 
significance, because the region is one of the Nation's major 
technology, energy, and financial report--export, and medical 
centers.
    So I support $2.8 billion for operation and maintenance; $6 
billion for coastal ocean data system; but, particularly, 
advocate for the study that I hope we can receive and so that 
we can assess the effectiveness of the tax dollars that we have 
received, the tax dollars that we hope to receive, and the 
effectiveness of making sure that we could be even a model for 
how you address the question of urban flooding in a location 
that is 50 feet below sea level, even though we are a few miles 
in from the Gulf.
    So I thank you all very much for the work that you do and 
ask your consideration. Thank you so very much.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Representative Jackson Lee. We 
appreciate you being here today. And Marcy, do you have 
anything?
    Ms. Kaptur. I just want to thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee 
for her excellent work and her indefatigability--Is that a 
word? Did I say it properly there? --on many fronts. And I have 
to say, all of the members of this committee, or the 
subcommittee, are very concerned about Houston and what has 
happened to you, the stalwartness it has taken for your people 
to come through the flooding, and wondering, you know, what the 
proper solutions are for--the proper engineering solutions are 
for an area like yours. We have also heard from witnesses from 
Georgia, Louisiana, and Florida, all along the southern part of 
the United States, the silting up of ports, the severity of 
storms, and now you are here as one of our final witnesses 
today. So it does make us wonder how to prepare our country for 
the future in this century, and so your information is very 
valuable to us.
    And I only have one question. In addition to that general 
concern about what is happening to our general weather patterns 
and environmental security along the southern part of our 
country, the entire question of your deep water port at Houston 
and how what is happening in the Panama Canal is impacting you? 
Could you expound on that just a little bit for it record, 
please?
    Ms. Jackson Lee. I would be delighted. And I would say it 
is a positive impact, and that is because of the new potential 
direction of the ships getting through much faster. Our port, 
which is now very close to the Panama's new route, so the 
Panama Canal's new routes that allow these ships to come 
through coming from the west and the east. We are seeing an 
increased use and higher tonnage coming into the Houston Port, 
which is a very large port, we are 10th in the world, but we 
are a manmade port, and we have to have dredging on a regular 
basis. And in order to maintain the viability of those ships 
and the income that comes in there, and also to be a 
contributor to the Nation's economy, because we do, we need to 
have the kind of maintenance that is intense and we need 
funding for that intense maintenance.
    So what I was saying is that it is a positive impact, but 
we are not a natural port, and that means we have to work at 
maintaining the port. And the port leaves the larger waters and 
comes into us up a 50-mile run that we have drudged to create 
the port, which is really right almost inside Houston, Texas, 
so inside city limits; our port comes into the city limits of 
Houston, and surrounding neighborhoods are there as well.
    So we have had a number of other issues that we have dealt 
with with the port being there, but the surrounding residential 
neighborhood has accepted the port, the port has tried to be a 
good neighbor, but all those concerns face us as a manmade 
port.
    Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. We appreciate your testimony and 
look forward to working with you as we put this budget 
together.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. I thank you, Chairman. Might I have a 
special appreciation to Ranking Member Kaptur, who took note 
the $3 million study in the last debate on the floor and her 
staff was very helpful to our office, and we are most grateful 
to you and for your leadership here, and to the chairman, for 
both of you working so well together. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. I yield back.
    Mr. Simpson. And, again, we will be in recess for a couple 
minutes as we are waiting for our last individual to come and 
testify.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Simpson. The committee is back in order, and will 
receive testimony from Congresswoman Watson Coleman. The floor 
is yours.
                              ----------                                
                                          Wednesday, March 8, 2017.
                                WITNESS
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE 
    OF NEW JERSEY
    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you so much, Chairman. And thank 
you, Ranking Member Kaptur. I want to thank you for this 
opportunity to testify today on the agencies and programs under 
the jurisdiction of the Energy and Water Development 
Appropriations Subcommittee.
    The Army Corps' Civil Works Program covers a wide range of 
water resources activities that are essential to the public 
health and safety. I appreciate the important work this 
subcommittee has done in ensuring adequate funding for the Army 
Corps programs in previous years, which has benefited many of 
our communities and constituents. In past years, groups like 
the Greenbrook Flood Commission have used targeted Federal 
investments under the Civil Works Program to improve quality of 
life by expanding on water resource development activities like 
recreation and flood risk management. The Civil Works Program 
has also allowed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen 
its relationship with our communities through its projects that 
have enhanced quality of life for thousands of people.
    The Greenbrook Flood Commission, which supports 13 
different municipalities in my district, has already provided 
rejuvenation and relief to residents by completion of 
components of the Greenbrook sub-basin project through flood 
control programs. This project encompasses an area that has 
been ravaged by extreme flooding, which has caused extensive 
property damage, and even the loss of life.
    Over the course of nearly 40 years, the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers project manager for this project has worked to 
ameliorate the extreme flooding conditions through the 
construction of extensive levees, flood walls, and pump 
stations. In fiscal year 2016, the Army Corps Civil Works 
Program received approximately $6 billion in funding. Providing 
the Corps with the sufficient funding for fiscal year 2017 and 
2018, it is critical to keeping projects like this moving 
forward, especially knowing that certain projects like this one 
have previously languished due to a lack of funding.
    Projects like this one also help build a stronger and safer 
America by constructing durable and sustainable infrastructure 
that prioritizes the protection of life and property. They also 
help modernize our communities and reduce the risk of damage 
from natural resources, while promoting job creation and 
environmental stewardship.
    So, again, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking 
member for this opportunity to testify, and hope that Congress 
will continue to support the robust funding for such critical 
programs. And with that, I yield back.
    [The information follows:]
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. We appreciate your testimony today.
    Questions, Ms. Kaptur?
    Ms. Kaptur. No, Mr. Chairman, but I do want to thank 
Congresswoman Watson Coleman for testifying today and for your 
support of the Corps. As we move forward here this year, we are 
expecting something on infrastructure from the administration, 
completion of many of these projects, augmentation around the 
country of work already underway could be a part of that 
measure, so I just wanted to put that on the table as we accept 
your excellent testimony.
    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you very much.
    And, Mr. Chairman and Madam Ranking Member, I just--I want 
to apologize for being a bit late. I was testifying downstairs. 
It is just one of those days.
    Mr. Simpson. It is one of those days. We appreciate it. You 
weren't late, actually.
    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Oh, good. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. But we appreciate you coming. We appreciate 
all the members that came to testify today. Their comments will 
be included in the record.
    And I would also remind members that might be listening 
that our member request day is closed on April--database closes 
on April 6, so have the individual member requests in to the 
subcommittee so they can start working on them.
    But thank you very much, Bonnie----
    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson [continuing]. For coming here today and 
testifying before us. And we look forward to working with you 
and your staff as we put this bill together.
    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you.
    Mr. Simpson. Thank you.
    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Appreciate it very much.
    Mr. Simpson. The hearing is adjourned.

JASON BUELTERMAN, MAYOR, CITY OF TYBEE ISLAND</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Mr.  Simpson. The hearing will come to order. Thank you, 
all of you, for being here today. This is the first time this 
Committee, I think, at least in my memory, and I have been on 
it for a long time, has had public witnesses. And I think it is 
a good idea and we have--also, because we have had the time 
this year, because we have not been able to have any other 
witnesses because we have not got a budget yet and probably 
will not until the end of this month, so we thought it was a 
good time to have the public witness hearing and hear what all 
of you thought is important in this bill and things we ought to 
be considering as we draft this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">I would like to welcome everyone to the Energy and Water 
public witness hearing. This morning members of the public will 
testify on issues that are important to them under the 
jurisdiction of this subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Each witness will have 5 minutes to present their 
testimony. Remember that your full testimony, the written 
statement, will appear in the hearing record. Members of the 
subcommittee may ask questions of the witnesses, but we would 
have a better chance of staying on schedule if we all work to 
keep this moving. We have to be done at 12:30 and we have 27 
witnesses it looks like, so I am going to keep to the 5-minute 
rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">So, would Ms. Kaptur have an opening statement?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Ms.  Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am just so happy we 
can all be together this morning. I want to thank you for your 
leadership and for this public witness day. I welcome these 
days in particular, of the testimony that will come before us, 
and they are both valuable and I would say quite motivating for 
those of us on this subcommittee. I look forward to hearing 
from all of the interested parties today on what you believe 
important to be in our bill. And with that, I will close my 
remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for arranging this important 
opportunity for all of us to work together on behalf of the 
Nation's best interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you. Our first panel is Mayor Jason--
pronounce your last name for me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Mr.  Buelterman. Buelterman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Mr.  Simpson. Buelterman, kind of throws my tongue in the 
middle, Buelterman, okay. Mayor and Derek Brockbank, welcome to 
the committee and the time is yours. Mayor, first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Mr.  Buelterman. Thank you very much. Good morning. I want 
to start by thanking Subcommittee Chairman----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Mr.  Simpson. Is the microphone on?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Mr.  Buelterman. I want to start by thanking you all for 
the opportunity to present before you today. My appearance 
before you is to underscore the need for increased 
appropriations to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
investigations account, specifically additional funding for 
shore protection investigations that the committee has provided 
in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">I want to use an example for my own city of Tybee Island, 
Georgia, to demonstrate what I believe is a pressing need for 
these funds across many coastal regions of the country. For 
those who may not be aware, Tybee is a barrier island located 
about 18 miles east of Savannah, Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">It is the eastern most point in the State of Georgia and is 
known for being a popular recreational destination for the 
region, as well as a vacation spot among tourists from outside 
the Savannah metropolitan area and is also home to about 3,000 
full-time residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">The sandy shoreline of Tybee is of significant value. While 
it is important to the city and region as a recreational venue, 
its primary purpose, the beach that is and the dunes, is to 
provide protection against damages caused by storms and coastal 
flooding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Recently my community suffered significant damage due to 
Hurricane Matthew. The total damage to Tybee amounted to at 
least $3.4 million. Those damages would have been far greater 
had our Federal Shore Protection Project not been in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">The Tybee Island Shore Protection Project was authorized by 
Section 201 of the Flood Control Act of 1965. It provides 
periodic renourishments estimated to be every 7 years until the 
end of the 50-year project life, which expires in 2024.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">The City of Tybee is working to extend the project's 
authorization and bolster its dune system. The Savannah 
district office of the Corps, at the request of our city, made 
a funding request for the President's fiscal year 2018 budget 
to fund what is called Phase II of the Savannah Channel Impact 
Study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Phase I of this study determined that approximately 73 
percent of the erosion of Tybee shelf and shoreline is caused 
by impacts from the manmade federally authorized Savannah 
harbor shipping channel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Under law, the Federal Government is responsible for 
mitigating damages caused by its own navigation projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Phase II of this study, which is one of the reasons I am 
here, will determine what measures will be recommended to 
address the erosion. The study will be all encompassing, 
including assessing adding dunes to the existing Federal Shore 
Protection Project and assessing the severe erosion that has 
occurred along the shoreline of the northern end of our island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">This portion of our island, although it is adjacent to the 
shipping channel, is not part of the current Federal Shore 
Protection Project and has been severely impacted by shipping 
traffic using the Savannah channel and will face even greater 
erosional impacts due to the channel's ongoing deepening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">I urge the House Committee on Appropriations to provide 
sufficient funding to enable the funding of the Phase II study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">I also want to highlight another issue that I respectfully 
ask the subcommittee to keep in mind as you determine future 
funding needs for shore protection projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">One of the major lessons of Hurricane Matthew and 
Superstorm Sandy was a massive amount of money that did not 
need to be spent in Federal post-disaster and flood insurance 
costs due to the existence of manmade dunes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">I have given all a one-page--two pictures here on one sheet 
of paper. These two photos you have before you illustrate my 
point. The top photo of is of a beach town right up the coast 
from the second photo at the bottom of a town called Harvey 
Cedars, New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Both aerial shots were taken right after Superstorm Sandy. 
The town in the top photo, and I am not going to identify which 
one that is, did not have manmade dunes. The bottom photo is of 
a town that wisely did have manmade dunes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">These dunes were built as part of a newer Federal Shore 
Protection Project by the Army Corps of Engineers. It is 
estimated that about $1.3 billion in Sandy-related damages were 
saved by the existence of Federal Shore Protection Projects in 
New York and New Jersey alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Dunes are not part, however, of many older Federal Shore 
Protection Projects, such as the one on Tybee. Because of the 
time of the creation of projects, dunes were not considered in 
the 1970s to be a big deal and to be essential for protection 
for coastal communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">I urge the subcommittee to consider adding additional 
shoreline protection funding with the appropriate report 
language, noting that a portion of the additional money is to 
be used to expedite adding a dune element to older projects 
using the existing cost-sharing percentages for those projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">If the Corps is required to produce a straight forward 
report on those projects designed prior to 1986 where dunes 
were not included in the project design, you will see that 
Tybee Island is not alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you 
today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">So the slow erosion of our beach is caused by the fact that 
sand that would otherwise drift to our beach naturally, gets 
stuck in the manmade shipping channel. Whereas the immediate 
impact from Hurricane Matthew had a very significant one-time 
event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">[The information follows:]</paragraph>

DEREK BROCKBANK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN SHORE AND BEACH</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Mr.  Brockbank. Thank you. Thank you for having me. My name 
is Derek Brockbank. I am the executive director of the American 
Shore and Beach Preservation Association. Founded in 1926, 
ASBPA is dedicated to preserving, protecting, and enhancing our 
coast by emerging science and public policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">We represent the Nation's coastal practitioners--the 
industry, the local government officials, and academics who 
build, restore, and maintain our Nation's coastline. The City 
of Tybee Island has been a member for many years now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">I am here today also to speak for natural coastal 
infrastructure, why beaches, high vegetative dunes, and vibrant 
wetlands protect communities from coastal flooding and storms, 
saving lives, protecting property, and reducing disruptions to 
the local economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Simply put, natural coastal infrastructure is a wise fiscal 
investment, saving the Federal Government money by reducing 
post-disaster recovery costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">As you heard from the mayor, the Army Corps of Engineers 
has estimated that investment in shore protection saved $1.3 
billion of damage in New York and New Jersey and $1.9 billion 
in damage total during Hurricane Sandy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Coastal protection is also a jobs bonanza. In addition to 
construction jobs, restoring and maintaining coastal 
infrastructure supports lifeguards, fishermen, hotel workers, 
waiters, and the plumbers and technicians who work in coastal 
towns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">So what needs to be funded? To protect our coastal 
communities and support coastal economies, the United States 
needs to, A, construct coastal protection and restoration 
projects; B, manage sediment as a resource, not a waste 
product; and, C, collect data and do coastal research to ensure 
that coastal projects will protect the people and assets they 
were designed to protect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">To meet long-term funding needs, Congress should invest $5 
billion over 10 years in beaches, dunes, and wetlands as part 
of a national infrastructure package. But to maintain existing 
capacity, we respectfully request that the fiscal year 2018 
Energy and Water Appropriation includes the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">One, provide at least $75 million to the Army Corps for 
shore protection. Shore protection or coastal flood risk 
management are the funds the Corps uses to construct and 
renourish beach and dune systems that protect vulnerable 
coastal communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">While the administration's budget has consistently left 
shore protection unfunded, Congress has reliably added funding 
to this critical Corps mission. After steady declines in shore 
protection appropriations, we were pleased to see a slight 
increase to 50 million in the fiscal year 2017 omnibus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">However, with our Nation's coastal communities increasingly 
vulnerable to severe coastal storms and the inevitability of 
the next major hurricane, we ask that you return shore 
protection funding levels to at least that of fiscal year 2014.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">The current Army Corps capacity for shore protection is 
$165 million annually, which was requested in a Dear Colleague 
letter led by Representative Wasserman Schultz as well as 
Congresswoman Frankel and fully supported by ASBPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Our request of at least $75 million is less than half what 
the Army Corps could accomplish and should be the minimum 
appropriated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Two, provide $5 million for implementation of the 
beneficial use of dredge material pilot program that was 
authorized in the WIND Act and provides $6 million increase to 
regional sediment management to develop sediment management 
strategies for the South Atlantic Coastal Study also authorized 
in the WIND Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">The WIND Act was a major bipartisan success last December 
and authorized a number of good coastal programs that require 
the Corps to manage sand and sediment, which are the building 
blocks of coastal protection projects as a resource, not a 
waste product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">The Beneficial Use of Dredge Material Pilot Program 
authorizes 10 projects around the country to innovatively use 
sediment dredged from navigation channels for coastal 
protection and/or environmental restoration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">ASBPA has heard that Corps districts have submitted more 
than a hundred projects for this new program. Clearly the 
interest is there. What the program lacks is funding. We 
request $5 million for the full implementation of Beneficial 
Use of Dredge Material Pilot Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">This South Atlantic Coastal Study covers one of the most 
vulnerable regions in the world for hurricanes from North 
Carolina, to Mississippi, and the Caribbean Islands. The full 
cost of the study is estimated to be 10 to $14 million, but an 
initial Federal investment of $6 million to the Corps' Regional 
Sediment Management Program would allow parts of this study 
that were previously authorized to begin in earnest and cut the 
cost of the study in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Finally, we request that you maintain funding for coastal 
data collection, including coastal ocean data systems, national 
coastal mapping programs, and Coastal Field Data Collection 
Program. Without good coastal data, Federal projects and even 
local projects cannot be properly designed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Given the Federal jurisdiction over the ocean and coast, 
this data acquisition must be via Federal agencies. So we ask 
you to at least maintain current funding levels for these key 
programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">ASBPA is grateful to your subcommittee and Congress for 
funding the Coastal Flood Risk Management Mission of the Corps. 
Of course these programs are but a few small pieces of a much 
larger investment needed to prepare our coastal communities for 
increasingly intense coastal storms and hazards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS">Improved coastal resilience will take coordination across 
multiple Federal, State, and Local authorities. It will also 
take a large-scale dedicated funding investment in coastal 
infrastructure. However, a good first step in protecting 
coastal communities is ensuring all shore protection, regional 
sediment management, and coastal data acquisition are 
appropriately funded. Thank you.</paragraph>

HON. PETE RAHN, SECRETARY, MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Rahn. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, 
members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me--sorry. 
Thank you for inviting me to discuss the importance of the U.S. 
Army Corps Engineers Civil Works funding to the Helen Delich 
Bentley Port of Baltimore, an economic engine not just for 
Maryland and the region, but for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ports are the key links to U.S. access, to the global 
transportation network, and Federal navigation channels provide 
access to these facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I thank the Committee for continuing to invest in maritime 
infrastructure and commerce, especially with respect to 
essential dredging projects that keep our shipping channels, 
our maritime highways safe and open for business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">This is a high priority for the Hogan administration, which 
is why the Maryland Department of Transportation requests that 
Congress ensure adequate funding in the fiscal year 2018 
budget, including $75 million for the Poplar Island and its 
expansion, $800,000 to initiate design for the Mid-Chesapeake 
Bay Island Project, $30.4 million in operations and maintenance 
funds for dredging the Baltimore harbor and channel's 50-foot 
project, and $12 million to maintain a depth of 35 feet in the 
C&amp;D Canal and approach channels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The Port of Baltimore generates about 13,000 direct jobs 
and about 128,000 jobs linked to port activities. It is 
noteworthy that the average income for a port direct job is 16 
percent higher than the average Maryland salary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The Port of Baltimore was just recognized for the third 
consecutive year as the most efficient U.S. container port. We 
handle more cars in roll on, roll off, heavy farm, and 
construction machinery than any other U.S. port.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The Port of Baltimore ranks first among all national ports 
in handling many commodities that are essential to our economy, 
such as aluminum, sugar, gypsum, cars, trucks, and equipment. 
We are ranked second in the Nation for exporting coal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Out of 190 major U.S. ports, Baltimore ranks 9th in the 
value of foreign cargo and 14th in foreign cargo tonnage. Our 
public-private partnership agreement with Ports America 
Chesapeake and the availability of a 50-foot deep container 
berth has positioned the Port of Baltimore to attract cargo 
growth associated with last year's Panama Canal expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Our tonnage increased 9.3 percent in the first 8 months 
since the Canal opened. The port's coal business has also 
increased significantly over the same period, as these ships 
need deep water, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">It is critical that the Port of Baltimore deliver 
sufficient long-term dredge material placement capacity to 
support maintenance of a 50-foot deep channel in terms of both 
depth and width to capitalize on that anticipated growth and 
maintain our existing business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">If the Port of Baltimore is the economic heart of Maryland, 
our shipping channels are the arteries. With more than 130 
miles of dredged channels, we work with the Corps of Engineers 
to keep our channel system open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Maintaining the shipping channels is critical to the 
continued success of the port. Approximately 4.3 million cubic 
yards of sediment must be removed annually to maintain Federal 
channels and anchorages at their authorized depths and widths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Keeping the main Chesapeake Bay channels open for shipping 
relies on placement of dredge material at Poplar Island and its 
expansion as well as construction of the Mid-Chesapeake Bay 
Island Project. The Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration 
Project at Poplar Island will provide an additional 28 million 
cubic yards of dredge material placement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The Mid-Chesapeake Bay Island Project is critical, because 
it will provide 40-plus years of capacity. Federal funding is 
essential to enable Mid-Bay Project at the time it is needed 
and to avoid deauthorization in calendar year 2021.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Federal funding for Corps dredging has been constrained 
over the last several years, and continued constraints will 
negatively impact the port. We believe that $25 million per 
year is needed to fully dredge the channels to Baltimore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The C&amp;D Canal is also an essential part of the port's 
shipping channel system providing the shortest route to open 
water for vessels traveling between Baltimore and points north.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Maryland remains fully committed to working with our 
Federal partners to deliver safe, efficient, and cost-effective 
maritime commerce infrastructure in Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. I would be 
happy to answer any questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Rahn. I appreciate you being 
here today and this is not the first time, or the last time, I 
suspect I will hear about port--harbor maintenance and 
dredging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Rahn. I would suspect not, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Rahn. All right. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. Mr. Chairman? Might I just say that the fact 
that you have named your port in memory of our dear 
Congresswoman Helen Delich Bentley gets my attention. She was 
one of my closest friends during my congressional service and I 
congratulate you for that. So my eyes are wide open on your 
request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I wanted to ask you, what do you do with your dredge 
material?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Rahn. If I may first comment on your first comment 
about Helen and having the port named after her, she was 
actually alive for the last 12 years that it has been named 
after her. So she was able to actually know the honor that had 
been bestowed upon her for her huge activity in developing the 
Port of Baltimore. She was an amazing woman with an amazing 
vocabulary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The question where we put it, so we have two sites, or 
three, for the Feds, for Federal placement? Three.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So we have three sites for Federal placement, but for the 
Corps, and then we have two additional sites that we use for 
the harbor dredging that we do as a State to keep the harbor 
open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. Do you use it or do you just store?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Rahn. Right now we are storing it, but we are looking 
for ways to reuse it. In fact, our State Highway Administration 
is changing their regulations to allow the placement of the 
dredge material into highway projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you. Mr. Frazier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">----------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Wednesday, May 3, 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">SOUTHEASTERN FEDERAL POWER CUSTOMERS, INC.
MICHAEL FRAZIER, SECRETARY, SOUTHEASTERN FEDERAL POWER CUSTOMERS, INC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Frazier. Thank you, Chairman Simpson, Ranking Member 
Kaptur, and members of the subcommittee. My name is Michael 
Frazier and I am appearing today on behalf of the Southeastern 
Federal Power Customers in support of funding for Southeastern 
Power Administration, also known as SEPA, and the hydropower 
program administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 
Southeast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The Southeastern Federal Power Customers is a not-for-
profit corporation that was formed over 25 years ago to support 
the interest of electric taxpayers that received the benefit of 
the Federal Power Program in the Southeast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The members of the Southeastern Federal Power Customers are 
customer-owned municipal utilities and rural electric co-op 
that purchased the Federal resources provided by the Army Corps 
hydropower projects and use that hydropower with other 
generation to keep electric rates as low as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">As you are aware, the power generated by the Army Corps 
hydropower projects in the Southeast is marketed by a separate 
agency under the umbrella of the Department of Energy. That 
agency, Southeastern Power Administration, SEPA, markets, 
sells, and arranges transmission for the power that the Army 
Corps projects provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Our request to the subcommittee today is straightforward. 
The Southeastern Federal Power Customers are asking the 
subcommittee to authorize the use of receipts of at least $6 
million to allow SEPA to continue to meet its statutory mission 
of providing the power in the southeast to consumer-owned 
utilities at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound 
business principals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">This request to the subcommittee can be easily met, because 
of the authorization for SEPA to use its receipts is considered 
neutral from a scoring proposition. In other words, funding 
this organization does not cost the subcommittee in terms of 
allocated dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Funding SEPA makes sense from a number of other 
perspectives as well. Authorizing SEPA to use receipts for 
program direction leverages revenues for the U.S. Treasury. 
Over the past four years SEPA has returned over $1 billion to 
the U.S. Treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Over the same period of time, it has been authorized to use 
roughly 28 million for program direction. It is a program that 
works for the Federal taxpayers. The program also includes 
other components such as the authorization to use receipts to 
wield the power and firm up power supply contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The subcommittee approves funding for these activities 
through the authorization to use receipts for purchase power 
and wielding activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Like program direction, this funding authorization is also 
neutral from a scoring prospective, because the receipts or 
payments for these activities are received in the same year in 
which the expenditures are made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The payments for these activities are typically passed 
through charges on a customer's bill, which means that the 
expenditures are reimbursed rather than absorbed by SEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Let me emphasize an important point about the Federal power 
program that SEPA administers. The cost of the Federal power 
program are recouped and paid for by the ultimate 
beneficiaries. There are too few Federal programs that can make 
that point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">For those of us that endeavor to keep the electric rates as 
low as possible for our taxpayers, our rate payers, we truly 
appreciate the support that this subcommittee has traditionally 
given to SEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We are also grateful for the support that this subcommittee 
has provided to the Army Corps hydropower program in the 
Southeast. As I mentioned earlier, the power market by SEPA 
comes from the Army Corps projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The Army Corps' costs associated with hydropower are 
recovered in the rates charged by SEPA. However, Congress must 
still appropriate the funding for the Army Corps' operations 
and maintenance programs in the first instance to keep the 
power plants running.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Although these expenditures are not treated the same as 
SEPA's direct program authorizations for scoring purposes, the 
subcommittee should be aware that the appropriations for the 
Army Corps hydropower program come back to the U.S. Treasury 
and the receipts paid for by the hydropower customers in the 
southeast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Every dollar put into the hydropower projects is returned 
to U.S. Treasury over time. In fact, I would encourage the 
members of the subcommittee to consider that funding the Army 
Corps hydropower program facilitates the payments to the 
Treasury, because the hydropower--if the hydropower equipment 
is not maintained, SEPA cannot sell the power which generates 
the revenues that I mentioned earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In conclusion, we ask that the subcommittee support SEPA's 
direct program, be it no less than $6 million, no less than $80 
million for purchase power and wielding activities, and no less 
than $75 million for the Army Corps hydropower programs to be 
used in the Southeast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Thank you for listening and I will be happy to answer any 
questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you. We look forward to working with

how many States does your authority exist, just Georgia?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Frazier. The Southeastern Federal Power Customers,

DAVID BEAN, COUNCILMAN, PUYALLUP TRIBE OF WASHINGTON STATE</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Bean. [Speaking native language.] Good day, honorable 
relatives and friends. My name is David Bean. I am from the 
Puyallup Tribal Indians. I am here today on behalf of my 
chairman, Mr. Bill Sterud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We appreciate the opportunity to testify regarding the 
fiscal year 2018 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Waterworks 
Resources Construction Budget. We especially want to thank Mr. 
Chairman Simpson for your continuing support of Indian Country, 
both in your capacity here on this committee as well as your 
former capacity as chair of the Interior Appropriations 
Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We are continuously taught by our late uncle, Billy Frank, 
to tell your story. I am here today to tell you our story about 
our treaty right and the resource. We are also taught by his 
father, Billy Frank, Sr., that all natural things, our brothers 
and sisters, we have a responsibility to take care of them. If 
they take care of the fish, the fish will take care of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In particular we ask the subcommittee's support for the 
Army Corps' work to replace the Buckley Diversion Dam and 
Buckley fish trap on the White River in Washington State. This 
work is necessary, so the United States can honor our treaty 
rights and meet its obligations under the Endangered Species 
Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The estimated cost of this work right now is 50- to $100 
million. In addition to funding, we request report language to 
direct the Army Corps not to consider this project a new start 
construction project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">This is necessary, because right now even if the Corps 
received the funding, there is a current directive by OMB not 
to engage in any new start projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">This seems ridiculous to us, since the planning and design 
for this project has been ongoing for more than a decade. To 
put this into perspective, Mr. Chairman, we started this 
process with your former colleague, Congressman Norm Dicks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In addition to the existing facility, 77 years old, far 
exceeding its intended service life and replacement structures 
would be more accurately referenced as updates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Since time immemorial, my Tribe has fished for salmon in 
the White River and the Puyallup River. My family has fished on 
these rivers for generations. We continue to do so this very 
day as treaties guarantee our right to fish from these rivers. 
My Tribe relies on salmon for subsistence, ceremonial and 
cultural purposes, as well as an economic resource. Now, three 
species of salmon are listed under the Endangered Species Act. 
They include the spring chinook, bull trout, and steelhead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Putting our treaty right in jeopardy, if there are no fish, 
simply there are no rights to exercise. Together the Buckley 
fish trap and Buckley Diversion Dam compose one facility 
located on the White River, which empties into the Puyallup 
River farther downstream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Since the dam completely obstructs the salmon's migration 
to their spawning grounds, the Corps installed the fish trap in 
a hold facility to serve as a pathway for the fish to prevent 
their extinction. Now the fish trap is 77 years old. It is 
completely outdated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">It was never designed to accommodate the runs of pink and 
coho salmon, which quickly overwhelmed its limited handling 
capacity. The limited fish handling capacity often creates 
delays where fish are backed up for a mile or more at the 
facility. This causes stress, delay, injury, and ultimately 
spawning mortality for all the fish, including those on the 
endangered species list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">It is long past time to replace the facility and several 
studies and biological opinions agree. Pursuant to the most 
recent National Marine Fisheries Service biological opinion, 
the Corps is required to replace the Buckley Diversion Dam and 
fish trap by 2020. If funding is not provided to continue the 
planning and construction of this project, this simply will not 
happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Because of the state of this facility, fishing season on 
both Puyallup and White Rivers was almost entirely closed to 
both Tribal and sports fishing last year. Thus, the impact of 
the Corps' failure to do its job, honor its trust 
responsibility to try to end Endangered Species Act, not only 
directly impacts Tribes' guaranteed treaty right, but the 
sports fishing industry in Washington State as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Fishing is a multimillion-dollar industry in the region and 
the health of these runs is critical, not only to the Tribes, 
but to the economy of the Northwest. One thing we are taught by 
elders that what affects one of us, affects all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We respectfully request that Congress include funding in 
the fiscal year 2018 Army Corps of Engineer civil works budget 
for the Buckley Diversion Dam and fish trap by 2020 sufficient 
to ensure that construction of this facility is complete by 
2020. This is necessary to ensure the Puyallup Tribes treaty 
rights are protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">With that, I want to close by saying thank you. We are 
appraisingly thankful to you for this opportunity to talk with 
you here today.</paragraph>

JOSEPH PAVEL, TRIBAL NATURAL RESOURCE DIRECTOR, SKOKOMISH TRIBE OF THE</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Pavel. Good morning, good afternoon. I am Joseph 
Pavel, natural resources director for the Skokomish Indian 
Tribe. Thank you, Chairman Simpson, Ranking Member Kaptur, for 
this opportunity to testify on behalf of Army Corps of 
Engineers' appropriation in the amount of $13,168,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">This is the result of the development of an Ecosystem 
Restoration Project, one of three that was approved and 
authorized by Congress, and the recent Watershed Improvements 
Infrastructure Nations Act--Improvements for the Nation Act, 
that is as much as I am going to read.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I would like to stress that this particular project 
addresses issues in the Skokomish River, the most frequently 
flooded river in Washington State, if not the Nation. You may 
have observed, or noticed, this is the river famous for the 
salmon swimming across the road. You have seen it. It is true 
and it is real and it is often.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So we signed on with the Army Corps in 2006, a cooperative 
financing arrangement with our partner, Mason County, and let 
me stress, this is a cooperation between Tribal government and 
local government of Mason County of Washington State, so I 
believe I could speak on their behalf in support of the project 
as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Then in 2012, we kind of got the first results of that that 
it would not be practical as a flood control project, but we 
could continue to develop the feasibility as an ecosystem 
restoration project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">As I mentioned, we started in 2006. These Army Corps 
general investigation studies have a reputation to tend to run 
long and over cost, so this particular general investigation is 
the first one that was completed under a new edict of 3 by 3 by 
3: $3 million, 3 years, 3-inch binder. So this is the poster 
child of the new and improved and efficient Army Corps of 
Engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">As far as I am aware, this is the farthest any of these 
ecosystem restoration projects has gotten. We are just looking 
to get this funding. The local school sponsors are responsible 
for a matching cost share. We have developed the resources to 
meet that obligation. Timing is of the essence, though. We have 
built momentum. We need to keep this moving. We need to get 
this project done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I would like to also mention that the Tribe, the county, 
and others have made significant investments in the watershed 
most notably. The city of Tacoma is a hydro project. We did an 
FERC relicensing of those. It is quite well known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">But we were able to secure significant contributions from 
the city of Tacoma. This watershed has been worked really hard. 
We hold that the United States, the Federal Government, 
sanctioned the actions of the city of Tacoma and they have some 
responsibilities to step up and assist with the remediation and 
the restoration of this watershed, as well as that hydro 
project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The upper watershed has logged 90 percent clear-cut dense 
roads, very heavily impacted environmental from Federal 
Department of Agriculture lands. So there is some 
accountability there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Great wealth has been obstructed from this watershed and 
has supported the industry of the city of Tacoma, their tax 
base, supported the industry, the forced products industry, and 
that has generated a great tax base. So it is time to return 
some of that wealth, put some of that wealth back to work on 
behalf of the resources that the Skokomish Indian Tribe depends 
on, essential to our recovery of Chinook, summer trim salmon, 
bull trout, steelhead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The Skokomish River is a significant contributor to Puget 
Sound recovery. We will not ever have a recovery of our 
endangered species at Puget Sound until we can address these 
recovery efforts in the Skokomish River. Thank you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. As I listened to the testimony this morning, 
including Mr. Pavel, I just have to say how important I believe 
an infrastructure bill is to this country. I will be one of the

JACKSON BROSSY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NAVAJO NATION WASHINGTON OFFICE</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy. Hello. My name is Jackson Brossy and I am the 
executive director of the Navajo Nation Washington Office. 
Thank you for this time to be here. I think it is important 
that we are here. Energy and water are two of the biggest 
issues facing the Navajo Nation today, so thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I want to address four different areas that impact the 
Navajo Nation, and this committee can help us grow our economic 
infrastructure. First, we see an area for the Bureau of 
Reclamation to help us out to support funding for an economic 
transition in light of the closing Navajo Generating Station. 
Second, we see an opportunity for the Bureau of Reclamation to 
support us in existing and building out new water 
infrastructure. Third, we see an opportunity for the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers' water programs to assist in further 
expanding our water infrastructure. And finally, the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers can help us with abandoned mine remediation. 
So I will start with the Navajo Generating Station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The generating station is a public-private partnership of 
coal-powered electrical generation on the Navajo Nation. And 
Congress was involved in creating this public-private 
partnership. And the reason we are here before you is the 
United States Government is an owner in this public-private 
partnership through the Bureau of Reclamation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">However, less than a year ago, these non-Navajo owners 
decided that they wanted to divest and shut down this plant. So 
closure of this plant would be devastating. A recent Arizona 
State study estimated that closure would--the impact could be 
$18 billion over a span of 30 years. So any investment in this 
project has the potential to save billions of dollars in an 
area where there is an untenable 40 percent unemployment rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So we seek a number of different proactive areas, including 
building out a railroad that will give us access to outside 
markets. We seek assistance with training for potential job 
losses in the thousands. And Congress is uniquely positioned to 
help us in this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I would like to transition into water infrastructure, 
another problem we have. There are about 15,000 homes in the 
Navajo Nation or about 30 percent in the Navajo Nation live 
without access to running water. That situation is absolutely 
untenable in 2017. And the Navajo Nation has been and continues 
to do everything we can to address this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We look at several different funding sources, including our 
own, and we put our money where our mouth is. And recently, 
this Congress passed--well, two Congresses ago passed the 
Navajo-Gallup Water Settlement. We ask for continued funding of 
the Navajo-Gallup Water Settlement in fiscal year 2018, and we 
also ask that the expired Rural Water Act of 2016 be 
reauthorized, so that we can work with the Bureau of 
Reclamation on different projects, including a 990,000 
agreement we have with the Bureau of Reclamation to connect 
with other existing water sources, so that we can get access to 
water for these folks on the Navajo Nation that do not have 
access to running water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The Navajo Nation also requests funding for the Bureau of 
Reclamation Native American Affairs Office. The Navajo Tribe, 
as well as other Tribes, take advantage of this office, and 
they help plan and coordinate and assist in a variety of 
projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Transitioning to the U.S. Army Corps, Section 205 of the 
Flood Control Act of 1986 authorizes the Corps to assist local 
communities in reducing flood risk through their Small Flood 
Risk Management Program. We support reauthorization and funding 
for that program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The Navajo Nation also requests funding for Section 520 of 
the Water Resource Development Act for the Navajo Nation flood 
plain mapping. There are currently unspent Navajo Nation funds 
tied to this authority, so are our own funds, that the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers cannot spend without additional 
appropriations. The Navajo Nation requests that $500,000 be 
appropriated into this authority to match Navajo Nation funds 
that we are already planning on investing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">And finally, transitioning to mining, there are a number of 
abandoned mines in the Navajo Nation that were created during 
the Cold War. Some of these mines were not properly 
decommissioned and some of them are still open today. This has 
created a tremendous health crisis on the Navajo Nation and we 
ask that the abandoned mines reclamation program be fully 
funded so that we can build out a database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Are these mostly uranium mines?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy. There are more than--there are about 500 
uranium mines in the Navajo Nation and about half of them have 
not been remediated. And the United States was the sole 
customer of these, and so, obviously, the Federal Government 
has the responsibility to clean this up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy. Yeah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman 
for testifying and just ask, could you repeat the number of 
homes on the Navajo Reservation that lack access? What 
percentage of the individual----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy. Fifteen thousand homes, about 30 percent of 
the homes in the Navajo Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. A third?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy. Yep.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy. It is an untenable problem, and we are putting 
our money where our mouth is, but we asked for additional help 
from every single source possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Yeah, we saw that firsthand when we were out 
there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy. Yeah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. What was it, the year before last, I guess?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy. Yeah, you rode on our dirt roads and----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Yes, I did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy [continuing]. Last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Azure. How are the mines secured currently? How are 
the abandoned mines secured currently?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Brossy. Many of them are not secured. Some of the 
larger ones are covered. I am not, obviously, an engineer in 
the space, but there are mines that our Navajo Nation president 
saw last year that were wide open. They had doors that had been 
broken and people and kids and animals could go in there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Azure. Thank you.</paragraph>

FLOYD AZURE, CHAIRMAN, ASSINIBOINE AND SIOUX TRIBES OF THE FORT PECK</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Azure. Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to be 
here. Good afternoon, Chairman Simpson, Ranking Member Kaptur, 
and the members of the subcommittee. My name is Floyd Azure. I 
am twice-elected chairman of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes 
of the Fort Peck Reservation, located in northeast Montana. 
Please continue to do the good work you have done in the past 
years to finance the completion of the Fort Peck Reservation 
Rural Water System. The project is a joint Tribal/non-Indian 
rural water project, which Congress authorized in 2000 with 
enactment of Public Law 106-382. The legislature authorized the 
construction of a rural water system to ensure a safe and 
adequate supply of municipal, rural, and industrial water for 
some 10,000 residents of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, and 
the citizens of Roosevelt County, Sheridan County, Daniels 
County, and Valley County, which border our reservation. At 
full build-out, the project is estimated to serve 30,000 
Montanans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">For fiscal year 2018, we seek approximately $27 million, 
with $14.7 million of those dollars for the Tribal portion of 
the water system, and $12.2 million for the Dry Prairie part. 
We hope that you will act favorably on our request, even though 
we do not have a congressman. Our congressman, Mr. Ryan Zinke, 
you will have his back and we will look out for his Montana 
constituents while he serves the entire country as Secretary of 
Interior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. That is somebody more important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Azure. To fund our request for fiscal year 2018, I ask 
the subcommittee to support an appropriations of $50 million 
for additional funding for ongoing rural water projects, a 
modest $3 million increase above the level this subcommittee 
recommended fiscal year 2017. This fund would supplement the 
specific funding for the Fort Peck Dry Prairie Rural Water 
system that is included in the President's annual budgets. This 
project grew out of necessity. Harmful levels of sulfates, 
irons, and brine contaminated our groundwater. We needed an 
alternate water source. We operate the water intake located in 
the Missouri River pumping station, a 3,000 square foot water 
treatment plant, and hundreds of miles of pipeline. Our two 
systems are interconnected and pump through our treatment 
plant. We are making our Tribal water rights available to 
Indian and non-Indian communities as our contribution to this 
effort. If our fiscal year 2017 construction funding is close 
to the $16 million we received for the project in fiscal year 
2016, we will be two-thirds complete with the $300 million 
project, with 16 years of Federal appropriations totaling just 
over $2 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We learned last month that our project is now ranked second 
by the ABOR among the Tribal rural projects. I ask that you do 
not abandon your work to complete the construction. We have 
completed two of the three main trunks of the rural water 
system connecting the Dry Prairie on the west and the east of 
our reservation, and continue to lay hundreds of miles of water 
lines to serve our new communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">As appropriators, you know that any delay in completing a 
project such as this only increases the cost to American 
taxpayers. It makes no sense to cut Federal spending for 
authorized rural water projects when the president, States, and 
union Tribes are all calling for infrastructure projects to be 
completed to help create American jobs and promote economic 
development, especially in rural communities. Safe and reliable 
water is essential to our communities' health and economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In conclusion, I urge this subcommittee to reject the 
administration's request to cut fiscal year 2018 appropriations 
for Bureau of Reclamation rural water projects and other 
nondefense agency appropriations critical to rural America. 
Federal appropriations are required to finance the completion 
of this important rural infrastructure project. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you, and if any of the committee 
members that--the last two people to testify, if you have not 
been out on some of the Reservations and seen the needs in 
terms of water and so forth, it is amazing what is going on. I 
have been very involved in trying to get the Cheyenne River 
Sioux Eagle Butte Water System completed out there that have a 
dire need, but it is throughout Indian country that we need to 
make sure that we maintain--it is amazing, in today's age, that 
people do not have access to fresh water, which is just 
incredible. So it is not only us, it is the Interior Committee 
also that has been working on it and stuff, so appreciate it. 
Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. Mr. Chairman, I just say for all of the Tribal 
representatives who are here today, I would urge you to work 
together and invite the President of the United States to your 
Reservations and to make sure that the infrastructure bill that 
they are considering over there--and it is a new 
administration, so they got a lot of issues--but that they see 
you, and, you know, you might get him to come.</paragraph>

DR. ELMER GUY, PRESIDENT, NAVAJO TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Guy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am Elmer Guy, 
president of Navajo Technical University in Crownpoint, New 
Mexico, on the Navajo Nation. I ask that my full statement be 
included in the record of this hearing, Mr. Chairman. On behalf 
of the Nation's 37 Tribally and Federally chartered colleges 
and universities, that collectively are the American Indian 
Higher Education Consortium, or AIHEC, thank you for this 
opportunity to address your subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for your past support of 
Tribal colleges. I would also like to thank the subcommittee 
for your longstanding support for the MSI partnership program 
operated by the Department of Energy's National Nuclear 
Security Administration. I am here today with a modest request 
for a small program with enormous potential. I respectfully 
request $5 million in the fiscal year 2018 Energy and Water 
Development Appropriations bill to continue and expand the new 
Tribal college initiative, which is part of the Department of 
Energy's NNSA/MSI partnership program. Tribal colleges first 
joined the MSI partnership consortia program about 2 years ago. 
Already, it has made a significant impact in our small 
institutions and the rural communities we serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Tribal colleges are place-based institutions located in 16 
States. We focus on Tribal Indian Nation-building through 
programs that sustain our Tribal cultures, languages, lands, 
and people. We are working to grow the country's Native 
workforce, and even more important, to create jobs in Indian 
Country to help address the deep-seated poverty that plagues 
our communities. Through AIHEC, Tribal colleges are 
implementing a long-term systemic plan to transition Native 
communities from local economies that perpetuate cycles of 
dependency and poverty into dynamic, innovation-driven 
economies, creating jobs and business opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">A key part of our plan is to work with new and emerging 
manufacturing technologies and methods to build jobs that 
Native Americans need and thereby to expand opportunity and 
leadership for all Americans. With seed funding from NNSA, we 
launched an advanced manufacturing program involving a pilot 
cohort of five Tribal colleges. This program will prepare a 
well-trained Native workforce in advanced manufacturing and 
create economic opportunities through the design and 
manufacture of products that are responsive to industry needs 
in these targeted technology areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">For example, the Center of Digital Technology at my 
institution, Navajo Technical University, has established a 
rapid growing advanced manufacturing program. Funded in part by 
the NNSA program and the National Science Foundation, NTU has 
developed a state-of-the-art facility, including 3D printers, 
computer numerical control machines, validation 
instrumentation, including metrology, that allows students to 
acquire knowledge and skills in design engineering, 
manufacturing processes, and performance analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Through this program, NTU is poised to become a leader, 
both in advanced manufacturing and the promotion of innovation 
and competitiveness through our own Center for Inspection 
Standards and Calibration. In fact, the Navajo Nation is 
contemplating investing in our college program, is helping 
recruit industry partners for research, development, and 
manufacturing projects involving faculty and students. Los 
Alamos National Laboratory is working with us to strengthen our 
metrology program simply because they lack metrologists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">This is one example of how Tribal colleges are creating 
models for small, under-resourced, and rural institutions to 
successfully participate in an advanced technology-supported 
economic growth area, while providing students, both male and 
female, with hands-on training that leads to careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr. Chairman, to ensure that the vital NNSA/TCU advanced 
manufacturing network initiative can continue, and more 
important, to help us accelerate the transformative power of 
relevant, job-producing higher education, we request your 
support for $5 million for the Tribal college initiative within 
the NNSA/MSI partnership program. Thank you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">----------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Wednesday, May 3, 2017.
MARIA KORSNICK, CEO AND PRESIDENT, NUCLEAR ENERGY INSTITUTE</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Korsnick. All right, thank you very much. I am very 
pleased to be here today and share with you the nuclear energy 
industry's view on the fiscal year 2018 budget. My comments 
today are going to cover four main areas. First, the NRC's 
outdated and costly regulatory regime needs to be updated. 
Second, accident-tolerant fuel and advanced reactors require 
urgent review and action. Third, that the Federal R&amp;D efforts 
that promote new technologies and innovation are essential. And 
fourth, the licensing of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository 
must proceed according to the law and in parallel with the 
pursuit of consolidated interim storage. I will summarize those 
four key points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">First, with the NRC, while our reactor fleet relies on a 
focused, efficient, and technically expert NRC, we believe that 
the agency's regulatory regime needs to evolve. Thanks to your 
oversight on this subcommittee, you have created additional 
attention and focus on the NRC's processing of licensing 
actions, its readiness to review second license renewal 
applications, digital instrumentation and controls, the backfit 
rule, and advanced nuclear fuels. We appreciate that, however, 
the NRC's work here is not yet done. Congressionally directed, 
independent assessments emphasize the need for NRC to continue 
improving the efficiency and transparency of its regulatory 
processes and operations, consistent with its own good 
principles of good regulation. As NRC rebalances its 
priorities, consistent with leaner budgets, we would ask them 
to integrate preparation for accident-tolerant fuel and reactor 
applications as part of its funding program. The NRC's own 
Project Aim 2020 report recommends shifting resources away from 
disciplines that are less in demand towards these activities to 
maintain the efficiency of the current fleet regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Second, by 2030, the United States could experience 
electricity shortages if a significant number of reactors are 
retired, as currently projected. To avoid this outcome, the 
industry is preparing a path to enable the renewal of the 
operating licenses of nuclear plants a second time, and that 
would be for an additional 20 years. Two plants have already 
announced plans to do so. While DOE's work in this area has 
been critical, additional work is still necessary through the 
Light Water Reactor Sustainability Project. That R&amp;D can reduce 
the operating cost of the existing fleet. This includes work in 
advanced instrumentation and controls and the accident-tolerant 
fuel program. Increasing funding for the accident-tolerant fuel 
program will actually allow the R&amp;D to be accelerated ahead of 
its current schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Congress should also continue funding for the Energy 
Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation. That project 
sponsors CASL, which is the Consortium for Advanced Simulation 
of Light Water Reactors. That initiative is successfully 
developing tools that help us optimize our fuel performance, 
support approval of new designs, and also support plant life 
extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Turning now to small modular reactors, the SMR licensing 
and technical support program we think has been a success. The 
new scale design, a certification application, has recently 
been docketed by the NRC, and TVA's early site permit 
application was docketed last year. The SMR/LTS program should 
be expanded to support first-of-a-kind engineering, and 
continued investment by the Federal government as a cost-
sharing partner is necessary to ensure that these first SMRs 
are deployed in the mid-2020 timeframe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Developing this technology is going to help U.S. companies 
capture an international market as well for smaller and more 
versatile carbon-free energy sources. So here at home, SMRs 
will complement the large, passively safe reactors that you 
know we are building in Georgia and in South Carolina. And 
given the benefits for domestic job creation, expansion of 
income and export income and clean electricity, we think 
Federal support for the SMR technology is a sound investment in 
our Nation's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Third, the ability of the nuclear industry to continue to 
innovate depends on the Federal Government supporting 
demonstration projects and encouraging advanced research. NEI 
supports the programs managed by DOE's Office of Nuclear 
Energy, and they seek to accelerate the commercial use of new 
nonlight water reactor technologies. The Gateway For 
Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, or the GAIN program, has 
expanded access to the U.S. national labs. The small business 
voucher program implemented last year was, in fact, very 
successful, and a second round of awards was announced earlier 
this year. We think this program should be expanded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The advanced reactor industry has formed three technology 
working groups now. There is molten salt reactors, fast 
reactors, and high-temperature gas reactors, and this focuses 
the R&amp;D needs, also interfaces with this GAIN program to inform 
the DOE Research and Development. Continued and increased 
funding for DOE advanced reactor program is essential to foster 
the ongoing and timely development and commercialization of 
advanced reactors, and also, in the continuation of funding for 
the industry cost-sharing awards that support the development 
of two advanced reactor concepts. Although the United States 
has a world-leading national lab program, it, in fact, lacks a 
fast neutron test reactor facility. Building an American 
facility would enable companies to accelerate the 
commercialization and eliminate our need to rely on a Russian 
research reactor, as we do today. We support the establishment 
of an independent U.S. facility in no less than 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Lastly, with respect to used nuclear fuel management, NEI 
supports funding for DOE and NRC to complete the licensing of 
the Yucca Mountain repository in parallel with the development 
of consolidated storage. We encourage Congress to restructure 
the funding and spending mechanisms of the Nuclear Waste Fund 
to provide for dependable access to the Nuclear Waste Fund 
while maintaining congressional oversight. Such action is 
essential to ensuring that the Federal Government can meet its 
statutory and contractual commitments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Thank you, Chairman Simpson, Ranking Member Kaptur, and the 
members of the subcommittee. I am happy to take any questions 
you may have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Fleischmann. Thank you, Ms. Korsnick, good to see you. 
Melissa, great to see you again. For the benefit of everybody 
on this subcommittee I just want to thank you all for the 
outstanding work that NEI does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">On a personal level, your support for the Nuclear Cleanup 
Caucus and all that we do in sites from Oakridge to a little 
place called Idaho, and across a great United States, thank 
you. Beautiful little place. Yeah, that is right. I have been 
once.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">If I may, I have two quick questions. Castle, you touched 
on Castle which is very important to us. Can you please, again, 
tell us how Castle has helped the current fleet in terms of 
nuclear power and how we can improve the economics of nuclear 
power using Castle?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Korsnick. I can give you a couple of examples. Watts 
Bar 2 is a plant that recently started up, and I know they used 
the Castle simulation program as part of that plant startup, as 
an example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I mentioned a recent SMR, small modular reactor, program 
NuScale is a company that is involved with SMRs, and I know 
they are using the Castle program as they are providing input, 
as they are finalizing their design and getting regulatory 
approval. And so the Castle program is being used in that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">And we are looking at using the Castle program, as well, in 
support of the life extension as well as accident-tolerant 
fuels, and they are two very key programs for the current 
fleet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Fleischmann. Thank you. And one further question. Does 
NEI support the Department of Energy reestablishing a domestic 
uranium enrichment capacity for national security purposes in 
the near term and why?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Korsnick. Yes, I would say from an NEI perspective we 
do think that it is important that the United States has the 
ability to enrich uranium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Fleischmann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. Thank you very much and we appreciate your 
testimony this morning, Ms. Korsnick. I wanted to ask you a 
difficult question you did not completely reference in your 
testimony. You probably have been here this morning, you heard 
about the Southeast Power Marking Authority and some of the 
other energy umbrellas that exist across the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In the region of the country that I represent nuclear 
energy is undergoing particular market pressure right now 
because of, I do not know whether one would call it an anomaly 
in the marketplace, but because of the movement of natural gas 
into our energy production, and the severe impact that has had 
on the nuclear industry. For the plants I represent and in the 
general Great Lakes region we have no such umbrellas across our 
region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Do you have any recommendations or thoughts you could 
provide now or to the record how we can deal with these 
companies? It is my understanding 25 percent to a third are 
heavily impacted currently. That could allow them to continue 
to function, but they may not be able to meet that test in the 
individual States in which they exist because energy pricing is 
really global in nature and we face the threat of a loss of 
many of our nuclear power plants in the commercial sector. Do 
you have any comments on that or could you providing 
information to the record on a range of solutions that you 
might suggest as head of your institute?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Korsnick. Certainly. I will provide a few comments 
here, but I will add more to the record, if that is okay. I 
would characterize the challenge that is facing the fleet today 
is, in fact, the low price of natural gas or the glut, if you 
will, of natural gas has put significant pressure on the 
operating fleet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I know that we have been working with the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission. And they have just, in fact, had a 
technical conference this week, and one of those items is to 
look at the value that nuclear brings to the marketplace, and 
the fact that all of that value is not being realized, in fact, 
in the market. So it is a significant challenge. You are right. 
We have closed six plants in the last few years, seven 
additional plants have announced, and there are more that are 
threatened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So I do think that this is a significant challenge. I would 
step back. I would say right now the solutions are playing out 
in individual States, so there was success in New York. There 
was success in Illinois, but there will be other individual 
State conversations. But I do think it is very important for us 
as a Nation to step back and look at what we have in nuclear 
power and appreciate the importance that nuclear power brings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">There are 60 reactors being built around the world today, 
two-thirds of those are Chinese and Russian design. The United 
States needs to be in that conversation. We do not get in that 
conversation by letting our fleet at home atrophy. We need to 
take this very seriously. We should look at it as a national 
security issue, and that is something that we are working very 
much to create that conversation. I am happy to add more for 
the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. All right. Thank you very much. And, Mr. 
Chairman, this is such a significant issue in the Great Lakes 
because when our nuclear power plants were built we actually 
function in the commercial marketplace. We have nothing like 
the Tennessee Valley Authority or the Bureau of Reclamation or 
the Southeast Power Market Authority. It simply does not exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">And these companies are really enduring hardship. I really, 
personally, I think we need a bridge financing package. The 
industry has not really asked for that. Right now they are sort 
of hostage at the State level, but this is an issue for this 
subcommittee, and also for the authorizing committee, I think. 
And I just do not, I am sorry to say, I just do not think our 
States are up for the task of meeting a national challenge. So 
I just wanted to put that on the record and we would welcome 
any additional comments you wish to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">E4THEFUTURE
STEPHEN COWELL, PRESIDENT, E4THEFUTURE</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Cowell. Hi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today. And I will be testifying, we have 
submitted testimony on behalf of myself, EForTheFuture, but 
also Home Performance Coalition. My partner, Brian Castelli, 
will be also talking about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So my goal is really to talk through about how energy 
efficiency, and specifically the work that is being done by DEO 
in the very critical role of working collaboratively with 
States is absolutely critical. Just a little bit about 
EForTheFuture. We used to be called Conservation Services Group 
and we ran the residential energy efficiency in 23 States, 
including Tennessee, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, California, 
Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts, and a few other States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">But we were able to assist, our nonprofit was able to 
assist over 3.5 million American U.S. households reduce their 
energy consumption over the last 20 years. That was our work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We recently sold our business work to a Texas company, 
Clear Result, and they are going to continue doing that. We are 
going to continue focusing on research, education, and 
innovation to really drive our energy economy for the future 
which is what we have to do. And so one of the things, really 
the specific points--and I would like to thank the House, 
specifically. Your continuing resolution continues the work 
that I am going to talk about, and so thank you very much, 
which I think you are going to vote on today, later today. I 
think it was a leadership effort, so thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Specifically, the Building Technology's Office at DOE does 
tremendous work around helping all of us in the energy 
efficient world, which energy efficiency is the least 
expensive. It is the most reliable and it is the most 
beneficial. Brian will be talking about the jobs impact 
analysis that we did in terms of how many jobs and its impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">But the Building Technology Office, part of EERE, is really 
critical to helping provide the background and the 
underpinnings for all the efforts in each State. The State 
energy programs provides the support to the State energy 
offices because this country, we have delegated managing and 
running our energy economy to the States. It is a critical 
partnership between State and Federal. If we do not have a 
strong energy economy we will not keep going as a country, so 
we really need to put all the pieces together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So we really strongly support that and the weatherization 
systems program, helping low-income people try to avoid energy 
poverty, and that is really critical as well. There has been 
great work over the years of the weatherization assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">As a matter of fact, CSE EForTheFuture started as a result 
of learning from the weatherization program in 1979. So a long 
history of tremendous innovation and others will be talking 
about the weatherization assistance program and its critical 
nature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We did put together a letter, which we have submitted, with 
almost 2,500 names, including names and businesses from every 
State, all of your States in terms of Ohio, Tennessee. 
Tennessee we had 135 different businesses submit a letter 
asking for support, continued support for those programs that I 
mentioned because they really are critical for a lot of 
reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So that letter was put together really with reaching out to 
all the people that we work with and talking about the value 
and the benefit that they bring. And one of those benefits, we 
did another report on the issue of the health impacts, 
predominantly low-income. And what we identified, we worked 
with DOE as well as several others, that, in fact, residential 
energy efficiency reduces healthcare costs, particularly 
Medicare, right? And it reduces asthma. It reduces a variety of 
health impacts, so it really produces benefits that we really 
had not even calculated before, and that ought to be, you know, 
recognized in the discussion, in the deliberation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Really, in closing, it is really critical to recognize that 
volatility of our energy prices is an absolute critical concern 
for our economy. In several cases, one of the things I did, I 
helped draft and put together the Stimulus Bill in 2008. I was 
asked to assist with that, and one of the research projects 
that we did was looking at the relationship between energy 
prices and home mortgage failure. They were directly related to 
each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Between 2003 and 2008, the average American family lost 15 
percent of their disposable income. And any homeowner who was 
on the edge was pushed over the edge. I presented this 
information to all the Senate staff, Energy staff and there was 
a gasp, like, oh, we did not realize that. The banks may have 
put the gasoline, but the match was energy costs. Right? So 
volatile energy costs have a tremendous negative impact on our 
economy, and energy efficiency is the way that we can stabilize 
those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So thank you very much. Appreciate the work that everyone 
is doing. We need to continue things like weatherization 
assistance, the State energy program collaboration really is a 
collaboration between State and Federal. You guys cannot walk 
away. You have got to work with each of the States in helping 
craft the energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Cowell. So thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you for being here. Thank you for 
mentioning all of those important States, but you left out the 
State. So other than that I am, you know, I am not going to 
say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Cowell. I know. I know. We did not work in Oklahoma. I 
am very sorry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. It is like the Ohio University, right?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Cowell. All the rest of you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Any questions?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. I welcome your testimony so much. You have 
found very receptive ears on this panel, but especially with 
this member. And I am hoping that an organization like your own 
will consider as part of the infrastructure bill to work with 
other colleagues and institutes and organizations on the 
outside to have a housing component to the infrastructure bill 
that may or may not be coming forward in this administration, 
this new administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I represent hundreds, if not thousands, of constituents who 
cannot afford to put a new roof on their homes. Many of them 
are seniors. What is happening in a State like Ohio, because of 
the difficulty with our nuclear power plants in the northern 
part of Ohio, which gets very cold, by the way, energy bills, 
if the State gets its way are going to go up more for people 
who are elderly, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">They cannot afford windows. They cannot afford insulation. 
They cannot afford weatherization. They get sicker, just what 
you say. And I just think we need a massive roofing program 
across this country, roofing, windows, insulation as a part of 
an infrastructure bill. And it ought to affect millions of 
people, not thousands because it is desperately needed. It 
could be a job training program as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So I thank you for your testimony. I am so glad you came 
today and thank you for the programs that you support at the 
Department of Energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Cowell. Well, thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Cowell. From a product's point of view, we have looked 
at, and I actually worked with Home Depot together and they did 
an analysis of where the products that go into energy 
efficiency improvement in homes and over 75 percent must be 
made in America because they cannot be made anywhere else, 
insulation is too light. Heating and cooling equipment is too 
heavy to transport. Glass, windows are too fragile. Right? I 
mean, these are products that are made in America and every job 
has to be an American. You cannot take a house and move it 
overseas and fix it and bring it back. That is a little 
difficult to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Cowell. Thank you.</paragraph>

BRIAN T. CASTELLI, PRESIDENT AND CEO, HOME PERFORMANCE COALITION</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Castelli. Thank you, Chairman Simpson, and thank you 
for the invitation here, Ranking Member Kaptur. My name is 
Brian Castelli. I am with the Home Performance Coalition and we 
are a nonprofit organization that advances the residential 
energy efficiency market through research, education, and 
policy analysis. We also hold the premier national and regional 
conferences on home performance, both the policy arena, as well 
as the best practices for installing energy efficiency majors 
in the home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">We work with all stakeholders in the industry, from the 
installers themselves to the manufacturers of the products. I 
am here to talk today about support for three of the Department 
of Energy's programs. One in the residential energy efficiency 
program and the other two in the weatherization and 
intergovernmental affairs office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Specifically, we would like to see the subcommittee support 
$200.5 million for building technology offices which develops 
the critical technologies, tools, and solutions to increase 
energy efficiency in homes and buildings. We would also like to 
see $23 million of that number focused on the residential 
building integration. Integrating all the different parts of 
the efficiency office that deals with homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">This has been a missing piece in the portfolio of programs 
that DOE has had, and we think this is now the time to get that 
program up and running. We would also like to support a $50 
appropriation for the State energy program. It supports the 
State and local efforts to develop and implement cost effective 
energy efficiency projects and leverage private sector 
innovations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Now, as a former director of the State energy office for 
Pennsylvania, and also as the Washington D.C. liaison for the 
California Energy Commission I would like to tell you, these 
are some of the most important infrastructure we have in the 
States are the State energy offices. They are where the rubber 
meets the road. They work with the companies, the corporations, 
and the individuals in those States to make sure that energy 
efficiency plays a major role in the energy programs of that 
State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">It is where innovation happens. That is where we really 
have a lot of the innovation, both on the policy side as well 
as the technology side. Many years ago when I was with the 
Pennsylvania Energy Office we teamed with both the Texas Energy 
Office as well as State Energy Conservation Office, as well as 
companies in Ohio, Columbia Gas of Ohio to do a community 
project in low-income weatherization where we did the first, 
the seminal work, in plug load monitoring both for electricity 
and natural gas. And that now has become an industry in and of 
itself, so I am very strong on supporting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">However, I notice that a good friend of mine, Doug Taylor 
is in here today. He is here now and he is going to speak later 
and he will tell you a lot about the State energy offices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The third program that I want to talk about is the 
weatherization assistance program. We would like to have you 
support a $225 million appropriation for that program. Steve 
talked a lot about the weatherization program. It helps low-
income, rural families, seniors, and individuals with 
disabilities to make lasting energy efficiency improvements in 
their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Oakridge National Lab has provided a lot of good data on 
this program, and it has shown that every dollar that is 
invested by the Federal government $2 to $4 returns in 
benefits, both to society, as well as the home owners. This is 
a critical program. It helps the most vulnerable, and I know 
that everyone in this room does not want to make the vulnerable 
more vulnerable or the poor poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">This is a program that helps these people. By lowering 
their energy costs they are able to use that money, which may 
have gone to a utility, but they can use it for food. They can 
use it for health. They can use it for a lot of things. So we 
are very strong on this program. They return a significant ROI 
and they deserve the support of the United States on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Jobs, Steve said I would mention jobs, this is a report 
that the E4 Foundation funded and supported. Done by an 
outside, objective consultant group that does these surveys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">And it is one of the most effective ways to save consumers 
and businesses money on their utility bills. There are two 
recent reports out. One came from E4, followed two weeks late 
by a report from DEO. Very similar results. The E4 report shows 
that over 1.9 million Americans are employed in the energy 
efficiency industry. It is kind of a stealth program, energy 
efficiency. Nobody knows about it. Do not understand how many 
jobs that there are there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The most recent report from DOE which was done with data 
from a year later showed 2.2 million full and part time jobs in 
energy efficiency. They are well-paying, diverse, and they are 
found in every State in the country. Again, these jobs are in 
the residential sector, 40 percent of them, and they involved 
the insulation of energy efficiency products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The contractors are the boots on the ground. They are the 
people who install these products in the homes, who do the 
installation, the windows, the roofs. And let me tell you, 
those jobs cannot be exported. They are indigenous jobs, not 
only to your State, to your country, to your local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">And the most interesting thing about this is there are over 
165,000 U.S. companies that are small businesses, fewer than 
ten employees in this part of the energy efficiency sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Just for some information here, you might be interested to 
know in the State of Washington there are over 38,000 energy 
efficiency jobs. In Ohio over 78,000 energy efficiency jobs. 
You probably, even though you know your State better than 
anybody, you probably do not realize how many jobs there are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In Idaho, nearly 3,000 jobs and these are important jobs. 
They are critical to the efficiency industry. They are critical 
to your State's economy, and we believe in them. And this is a 
good program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So we believe that energy efficiency is vital to the 
economic growth. The industry supports millions of these well-
paying jobs, and we urge the subcommittee to preserve at least 
level funding for the DOE programs I mentioned earlier, and 
outlined in the written testimony we provided earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I want to thank you, again, for the opportunity to provide 
this testimony. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you. And I will just announce for the 
committee's sake that we are so far 25 minutes behind schedule, 
and not quite half way through yet, so everybody speak quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Castelli. I am happy to answer quick questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Simpson. Ken.</paragraph>

KEN J. ROBINETTE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SOUTH CENTRAL COMMUNITY ACTION</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Robinette. Good morning, Chairman Simpson, ranking 
member Kaptur and committee members. I am the CEO of the South 
Central Community Action Partnership in Twin Falls, Idaho. I am 
pleased to submit testimony today to support the Department of 
Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program referred to as WAP. 
I would also like to thank the two presenters that just came 
before us that talked about WAP to set me up for this 
presentation. So thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">With the Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance 
Program I would respectfully urge this committee to fund the 
Weatherization Assistance Program in fiscal year 2018 at a 
level of 230. That is a little bit above what they had 
recommended but we are deeply concerned about the 
administration's proposal to eliminate WAP and I believe that 
this funding level is essential in continuing and improving the 
outstanding results of the program. The WAP celebrated its 40th 
anniversary in 2016. Today I want to highlight the impact that 
the WAP has nationwide as well as demonstrate what the program 
makes a difference in my State of Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The WAP is a proven, cost effective and successful model of 
a Federal, State and local partnership. WAP services are 
delivered by more than 900 organizations, many of which are 
community action agencies like mine. WAP operates in every 
corner of the Nation making a difference in both urban and 
rural communities in all 50 States and the District of 
Columbia, U.S. Territories, and Native American Tribes. Since 
its inception in 1976 over 7.4 million homes have been 
weatherized by WAP. That is 7.4 million families with extra 
money in their pocket and living in a safer, healthier more 
comfortable home. It is widely known that the families with low 
income pays a larger portion of their income towards home 
energy costs and their higher income counterparts about 16 
percent of income versus just three percent according to 
Oakridge National Laboratory. Weatherization helps alleviate 
this high energy burden through cost effective, energy 
efficiency improvements such as insulation, air sealing, HVAC 
systems, lighting and appliances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">According to DOE, in cold weather States like Idaho WAP can 
reduce heating costs by as much as 30 percent and families in 
weatherized homes save at least $283 each year on their energy 
costs. This income can be used to pay for goods like food, 
medicine and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">According to a commonest at the Home Energy Affordable Gap 
Project, Idaho households with incomes below 50 percent of the 
Federal poverty level pay a staggering 21 percent of their 
annual income simply for their home energy bills. Idaho has six 
WAP providers that serve all 44 counties and weatherize 
approximately 975 homes annually for families and individuals 
that are economically disadvantaged. Of those homes weatherized 
each year more than 2,400 individuals many of which are 
elderly, disabled and young children now live in a more energy 
efficient and safer home. Many of our families submit letters 
of thanks for assistance they received.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I would like to share one of those letters from a family 
who owns a home in small farming community of Hazelton, Idaho. 
This family where dad and mom are both working with one small 
child who is disabled writes we are so grateful and could not 
thank you all enough of everything. I was so amazed how 
professional all the guys were. Our home used one third of the 
electricity and a lot less coal. The proof is in out reduction 
of our power bill. Also my son has only had one minor cold. 
Last year he had several because the cold drafts and 
fluctuation of temperature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In addition to providing substantial emergency savings for 
hard working American families, the WAP also makes homes 
healthier and safer. For every dollar invested in 
weatherization, $2.78 cents were generated in health and safety 
benefits. Weatherization measures generally improve 
ventilation, mitigate mold, and improve indoor air quality. As 
a result, residents of weatherized homes experience fewer 
asthma and allergy symptoms as well as fewer hospitalizations. 
Children in weatherized homes missed fewer days of school and 
their parents missed fewer days of work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In the Oakridge National Laboratory study of WAP residents 
reported paying an average of $514 less out-of-pocket medical 
expenses after weatherization. Not only does WAP make a 
necessary, needed improvement to our national aging housing 
stock, but it also helps American workers and American 
businesses. The WAP directly supports more than 8,500 jobs and 
indirectly supports thousands more in related business. The WAP 
has provided training and workforce development to thousands of 
low-income and middle-income workers allowing them to secure 
stable employment across the entire State or across the entire 
supply chain from WAP crews, material suppliers, tech 
companies, and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Idaho is also a great example of another key success of WAP 
with a strong record of leveraging and additional funds to 
supplement the Federal dollars. The main method of leveraging 
is through partnerships with utility companies. Many of which 
depend upon the WAP delivery network to carry out low-income 
residential efficiency incentives. In 2015, increasing--excuse 
me, let me back that up. At least 21 States were able to 
leverage additional funds from utilities in 2015, increasing 
the impact of the WAP in those States. This leveraging activity 
is only possible with the critical base money from DOE as well 
as DOE's reputation and high quality standards. In Idaho, we 
have had a longstanding partnership with three of our largest 
utility companies. Over the past 5 years, they have contributed 
more than $11.8 million that were invested in approximately 
2,200 households throughout the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In closing, I would like to extend my gratitude to all of 
you for your hard work and continued support of WAP over the 
years. I again respectfully urge the subcommittee to find or 
fund the WAP at $230 million for fiscal year 2018, the funding 
level necessary we believe to sustain a national program to 
serve low-income families in all local communities. Thank you.</paragraph>

RAY JUDY, ENERGY SERVICES DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR STATE</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Judy. All right, thank you. My name is Ray Judy and I 
am the energy services director for the National Association 
for State Community Services Programs and I appreciate the 
opportunity to come and speak to you today mainly regarding the 
Weatherization Assistance Program, which is near and dear to my 
heart. So I am pleased to submit testimony in support of the 
Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">As some of the numbers that you have already heard we are 
seeking an fiscal year 2018 appropriations level of $230 
million for the Weatherization Assistance Program and $70 
million for the State Energy Program. NASCAP is a member 
organization representing the weatherization grantees and the 
directors in all 50 States, D.C., and five U.S. territories on 
all the issues related to WAP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The State office is represented by organization. We would 
like to thank this community for its support of the WAP and SEP 
through the years. Additionally, we would like to share our 
appreciation for the increase in WAP funding contained within 
the omnibus for the fiscal year 2017 funding. I have been 
working in the weatherization program for over 29 years with 
the first 28 years of that being spent in Indiana's 
weatherization program and have witnessed throughout that time 
firsthand the impact that the WAP has on the most vulnerable 
households in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Weatherization provides a foundation for residential clean 
energy investments that sustain jobs and save families money 
through improved energy efficiency. In its 40-year history the 
WAP has weatherized over 7.4 million homes, helping hard-
working American families, particularly those that are elderly, 
disabled, and families with children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The need for weatherization services is significant. DOE 
estimates that 20 to 30 million families are eligible for WAP 
each year. This represents an incredible opportunity for energy 
savings that cannot be obtained without the WAP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Weatherization managers like insulation, air ceiling, high-
efficiency HVAC systems are investments that pay off for the 
life of the home reducing energy waste and saving families 
money month after month and year after year. With lower energy 
bills these families can increase their usable income and buy 
essentials like food, clothing, medicine, and health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In addition to delivering savings to families, the WAP 
plays a significant role in supporting jobs in workforce 
development and we will repeat the number again that WAP 
supports at least 8,500 jobs in weatherization and thousands 
more across the supply chain and material suppliers, vendors, 
and manufacturers. It is also important to highlight that the 
work performed under WAP meets extremely high quality standards 
set forth by DOE. In recent years, DOE has developed and 
implemented standard work specifications that ensure all homes 
receive the highest quality weatherization services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">As of 2016, there are over 1,600 building performance 
institute-certified quality control inspectors. This workforce 
of QCIs ensures that 100 percent of the units weatherized with 
DOE funds are inspected for quality. And in addition that 
number, the WAP grantees inspect 5 percent of those units in 
sharing another layer of review during their time in 
monitoring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Another critical benefit of the WAP is its positive impact 
on the health and safety of families. You have heard this 
again, but it really bears the repeating these numbers and this 
information. It makes sense that in a home that is cold and 
drafty or full of mold and excess moisture there is an 
increased risk of recurring illnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">What we have learned over the years is that the nonenergy 
benefits of weatherization results in a healthier living 
environment. This was confirmed by the Oakridge National 
Laboratory evaluation which found that residents of weatherized 
homes experience fewer asthma, allergy, and cold symptoms. 
Weatherization mitigates factors that can trigger an asthma 
attack resulting in fewer emergency room visits and 
hospitalizations. WAP measures can also prevent other life-
threatening events such as carbon monoxide poisoning and fires 
from unsafe heating sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">After weatherization families have homes that are safer and 
more livable, resulting in fewer missed days of work and 
school. These outcomes pay off. Again, every weatherization 
dollar spent returns $2.78 in health and safety benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">These economic benefits are even more significant when 
viewed in light of our Nation's staggering healthcare costs. 
According to the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative, $82.4 
billion in healthcare costs are lost each year due to 
inefficient and unhealthy housing. That is 3 percent of the 
total U.S. healthcare costs. The CDC estimates that asthma 
alone costs the United States $56 billion per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Despite the wide range of benefits and proven cost 
effectiveness of the Weatherization Assistance Program and the 
State Energy Program, the administration's fiscal year 2018 
budget blueprint zeroed out both programs, citing a need, ``to 
reduce Federal intervention in State-level energy policy and 
implementation''. However, WAP and SEP are models of success; 
successful Federal, State, and local partnership, not Federal 
intervention. Elimination of these programs will result in loss 
of jobs as well as decreased investment in local businesses, 
which will harm the financial stability, health, and safety of 
families across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">NASCAP respectfully urges the subcommittee to fund the WAP 
and not less than $230 million for fiscal year 2018 and the 
funding level necessary to sustain the national program. NASCAP 
also supports the appropriation of 70 million in fiscal year 
2018 for the State Energy Program. And NASCAP also looks 
forward to working with committee members in the future to 
ensure that these programs continue to deliver cost-effective 
results that support our economy and make a difference in the 
lives of the most vulnerable in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">And to end, we just really appreciate the opportunity to be 
here today and to speak to the benefits of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Kaptur. Mr. Chairman, I want to take just 5 seconds to 
ask the prior witness, Mr. Robinette, and yourself if you could 
submit from that Oakridge study to each of the members up here 
by their State from the inception of the program how many units 
have been weatherized and then the State-by-State achievements 
over that period of time and what remains to be done. I think 
that that would be very--to take the one example you provided 
for Idaho and to extend that to other States, that might be 
very--we have a lot of new members on this subcommittee. Thank 
you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Robinette. Absolutely, be glad to.</paragraph>

DANIEL RIEBER, WEATHERIZATION DIRECTOR, NORTHERN MANHATTAN IMPROVEMENT</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Rieber. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. My name is 
Daniel Reiber and I am the weatherization director at the 
Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation in New York City, or 
NMIC as we say. I am here today before this committee to submit 
testimony in support of the Department of Energy's 
Weatherization Assistance Program, or WAP. I respectfully 
request that the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) be 
kept whole and funded nationally at $230 million for fiscal 
year 2018.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">At NMIC we integrate numerous crises innovation services 
under one roof. With their crises resolved our clients move 
seamlessly to capacity building services through our holistic 
programs designed to support individuals and families as they 
develop the tools to transition from crises to self-
sufficiency. Our weatherization program is a critical piece of 
our mission to serve as a catalyst for positive change in the 
lives of people in our community on their paths to a secure and 
prosperous future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The WAP is the largest energy efficiency retrofit program 
in the Nation. The local community action agencies and 
community-based organizations that implement the program are 
skilled, highly trained, and held to higher standards that are 
often required in the commercial marketplace for equivalent 
work. For 40 years the WAP has led the charge for energy 
efficiency and used building science to properly evaluate, 
diagnose, and retrofit houses and buildings so they may become 
more energy efficient and safe. The WAP workforce sustains 
almost 9,000 jobs nationwide. Additionally, thousands of jobs 
are sustained through related industries and the hiring of 
small business contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">NMIC utilizes subcontractors throughout the program year to 
provide windows, boilers, insulation, and ventilation upgrades. 
This workforce can consist of up to 100 works from 8 different 
small business contractors. Over the past several years we have 
seen the availability of affordable apartments become very 
scarce in Manhattan. Accordion to the National Low-Income 
Housing Coalition in the State of New York there are just 35 
affordable units available for every 100 low-income renters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">As low-income tenants struggle to live in our great city, 
the weatherization program is more important today in helping 
to preserve affordable housing for low-income families, 
especially children, seniors, and individuals with 
disabilities. Most of the buildings we have served in the last 
grant period were extremely inefficient and in desperate need 
of energy conservation measures, causing residents to pay 
significantly more than necessary towards energy costs. 
Additionally, the need for these services is staggering. Our 
organization alone has 800 units in over 20 buildings on our 
waiting list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">NMIC works with building owners who are committed to 
preserving affordable housing while still running a profitable 
business. Many properties were neglected over time and are in 
great need of assistance. Such things as boilers, pipe and roof 
installation, roof repairs, and windows. WAP helps keep low-
income people in affordable, safe, energy-efficient, and 
healthy homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Furthermore, weatherization dollars are key to helping low-
income, tenant-owned buildings survive. These HDFC, or Housing 
Development Fund Corporations as they are known, typically have 
poor cash flow and high energy burden. By assisting these 
buildings, the WAP helps preserve the essence of affordable 
housing in low-income neighborhoods and, at the same time, 
improves the quality of life in our various communities. The 
DOE weatherization program is critical because it provides the 
critical base with which to leverage and combine other funding. 
We utilize a mix of program, owner, utility, and State energy 
office, NYSERDA in this case, dollars to weatherize buildings, 
make them sustainable, safe places to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">One thing is certain, should the Federal funds for WAP be 
significantly reduced or zeroed out, the impact would be 
devastating to our community. Building owners will seek out 
repairs and pass that cost on to tenants. This upward pressure 
on rent will force people out of their homes, thus creating a 
vicious cycle of displacement and uprooting of families and the 
elderly. The stress of losing your home through no fault of 
your own is the kind no one should have to endure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Furthermore, the nonprofits in support of housing agencies 
that rely on WAP for their clients will most likely defer 
maintenance until they are able to make repairs, endangering 
the health and safety of their residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I will just highlight in my testimony our two case studies 
which show energy-saving reductions in two buildings of 42 
percent and 47 percent, respectively. In both cases the low-
income residents were direct beneficiaries of an affordable, 
safer, more comfortable home with no fear of a rent increase. 
Founded in 1979, the staff of two with the goal of assisting 
immigrants in northern Manhattan who were at risk of being 
evicted, Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation has grown 
to be one of New York City's most trusted, innovative, and 
effective poverty fighting organizations. Our programs include 
legal services, social services, education and career services, 
weatherization, and community organizing. The loss of the 
weatherization program would impact our ability to achieve our 
mission as we would no longer be able to provide the 
comprehensive services that makes a difference in the lives of 
the most vulnerable in our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In closing, I urge the subcommittee to fund the WAP at no 
less than 230 million for fiscal year 2018, the funding level 
necessary to sustain a national program. This is a program that 
has proved its worth and effectiveness over 40 years. The WAP 
plays a critical role in providing and preserving affordable 
housing in our community and helps hard-working families across 
the entire country. I thank you and also want to thank you for 
adding 13 million to the FYI 17 Omnibus Bill. We appreciate 
that very much.</paragraph>

DAVID HEPINSTALL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ASSOCIATION FOR ENERGY</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">AFFORDABILITY, INC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Mr.  Hepinstall. Good morning. As the executive director of 
the Association for Energy Affordability, AEA, I represent and 
serve a network of not-for-profit community-based organizations 
that provide weatherization services to low-income households 
throughout downstate New York. AEA is a national weatherization 
training center and a WAP-funded technical services provider as 
well as a direct services subgrantee in New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In the last 10 years AEA itself has weatherized 9,000 
housing units and completed investment grade energy audits of 
2,400 buildings with over 112,000 units in New York, while also 
every year having trained hundreds of program staff, 
contractors, and building operators in New York and nationally. 
I am here today to urge you to fund the Department of Energy's 
Weatherization Assistance Program at least 230 million and 
DOE's State Energy Program for 50 million for fiscal year 2018. 
Funding at this level is needed to retain the expertise in 
infrastructure that enables weatherization to deliver its 
essential services to low-income households throughout the 
United States and supports State energy programs that work 
collaboratively with weatherization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Weatherization employs energy auditors, retrofit 
installers, quality control inspectors, and project managers 
with deep expertise in whole building energy efficiency. In New 
York State alone 736 persons are fully or partly employed 
directly by weatherization and yet even more work is performed 
by local heating, plumbing, electrical, and ceiling contractors 
hired and overseen by weatherization. These local agency and 
contractor jobs affect the local economy. They cannot be 
outsourced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">WAP also supports accredited training programs conducted by 
training centers like AEA to prepare workers for BPI 
certifications and help program staff and contractors deliver 
deep energy savings. Weatherization in New York also leverages 
substantial private resources from building owners and 
utilities to complete its energy efficiency upgrades helping to 
preserve affordable housing and make a lasting impact on low-
income communities. Cost-effective, whole house weatherization 
saves money and energy and improves occupant health, safety, 
and comfort for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Weatherization enables low-income families to meet more of 
their basic needs despite limited incomes simply by reducing 
energy waste in their homes. Yet the very program that makes 
all of this possible, that has spawned valuable technology 
improvements along the way, that is celebrating 40 years of 
bipartisan support today, finds itself on the chopping block. 
Passing the current CR is a start, but having at least 230 
million in the 2018 budget is the key. If the weatherization 
program were to be defunded or there were major cuts in fiscal 
year 2018 funding, both program staff and contractors would 
experience job loss, many moving on to other types of work. 
This would be a huge loss to their communities and not easily 
reversed if the infrastructure of WAP were dismantled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In New York City, only 16 percent of low-income households 
own their own homes compared to 42 percent nationally. Most are 
renters living in older, multifamily buildings. Preserving the 
affordability of their housing requires more than a few low-
cost measures in their units. Energy-efficient heating, hot 
water, and ventilation systems are needed to control building 
and operating costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Seventy-one percent of low-income households in New York 
City are severely rent burdened, meaning they pay over 50 
percent of their income for rent and utilities. This places 
them at a high risk of becoming homeless. WAP policies and best 
practices in New York contribute to economic and social 
stability of low-income families and neighborhoods by reducing 
the energy and maintenance costs that may otherwise lead to 
rent increases and displace many families from their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The positive effects of WAP in New York City multifamily 
buildings begin even before retrofits begin because owners must 
ensure code violations and other hazardous conditions 
identified in the building audit before weatherization work can 
even begin. Weatherization helps by simulating owners to invest 
in low-income communities that have suffered from 
disinvestment. Weatherization measures contribute to the health 
and safety of building residents, improving indoor quality and 
removing conditions that trigger asthma symptoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">DOE rules permit energy efficiency upgrades to central 
systems in multifamily buildings when the required percentage 
of households in the building is income eligible. This allows 
local weatherization subgrades in New York City to take a whole 
building approach to energy efficiency that helps to maintain 
housing affordability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Multifamily weatherization in New York protects low-income 
residents in housing affordability by requiring building owner 
investment of at least 25 percent of the cost of the building-
wide energy upgrades, prohibiting owners from increasing rents 
based on capital improvements, co-funded by weatherization, and 
preventing displacement of low-income tenants by requiring any 
apartment vacated by a low-income resident to be rented to 
another low-income household for at least 5 years after 
weatherization upgrades have been completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Those are things that have been developed in New York 
specifically coming from below, from subgrantees, and it is 
possible because of DOE regulations as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">So I really want to thank you for the opportunity to 
testify today and say I have been in this for 27 years and gone 
to a lot of buildings in New York City, and I remain to this 
day deeply moved by the positive impacts on so many households. 
We have pictures of before and after. We have movies, frankly, 
of that as well, and the impact on households and buildings and 
whole neighborhoods would be far-reaching, adverse, unintended 
consequences if this essential program were to end or be 
crippled by deep funding cuts. Please do not let this happen.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Ms.  Spiropulu. It is Greek. Chairman Simpson, Ranking 
Member Kaptur, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, I 
want to thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am 
here to discuss the importance of the United States in 
leadership in high-energy physics funded by the Department of 
Energy of the Office of Science, and why sustained government 
investment is needed to continue making world-changing 
discoveries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The major reasons why we need to sustain our excellence in 
particle physics are, for one, the basic research to understand 
and explain the universe. Secondly, our international 
leadership, our workforce development, and our technology 
breakthroughs. These accomplishments have only been possible 
through the support of your committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">In fact, you are the sole sponsor of this curiosity-driven 
research. So, I want to thank you for providing just recently 
$825 million for HEP for fiscal year 2017, and I ask you to 
consider providing the $868 million for fiscal year 2018, to 
advance our ongoing critical research and infrastructure 
projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I have been a particle physicist for 24 years, and I am now 
a professor at Cal-Tech. Back then, we were building for 
discovery, and discovery we did, and Building For Discovery is 
the title and the name of the report that laid out a 10-year 
strategic vision for the U.S. particle physics by what is 
called the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel, P5 
for short, which you have heard from before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">It took the high-energy physics community a good 2 years to 
come up with this P5 plan, and sacrifices were made. We are now 
in the midway of its execution, and I am very glad to report 
that all projects are on time and budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The highest priority in the P5 report is continuing our 
collaboration with CERN, the leading European laboratory, and 
meeting our commitments to the Large Hadron Collider, and the 
associated more than 2,000 American researchers, physicists, 
technicians, students. This will happen by funding the 
upgrades, the upgrade detectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Now, mind you, with the LHC we found a unique particle that 
is necessary to complete our particle physics model of the 
universe, the blueprint of the universe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">The highest medium-term P5 priority is the Long-Baseline 
Neutrino Facility, or LBNF. Fermilab will host LBNF and lead 
the world's accelerator-based Neutrino Research Program, 
studying the least understood, the most puzzling, and the 
highest abundant matter particles in the universe than 
neutrinos. LBNF will be the largest U.S.-based international 
science facility and the largest research program Neutrino has 
ever undertaken worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">As part of the detector, which is called the Deep 
Underground Neutrino Experiment, DUNE, Fermilab will shoot 
neutrinos 800 miles from Illinois all the way to South Dakota 
at the Sanford Underground Research Facility where we are 
building four massive detectors that are a mile underground. 
LBNF and DUNE will be for neutrinos what the LHC is for the 
Higgs, namely the mothership of deep exploration and discovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">And, very importantly, this international project continues 
to gain financial contributions from many other nations. In 
fact, following a cooperative agreement signed 2 years ago 
here, CERN, our closest collaborator, for the first time 
decided to invest outside Europe and invest on LBNF in South 
Dakota--Fermilab in South Dakota. And as of yesterday, 
additional protocols and agreements were signed at CERN, and 
CERN engineers and technicians started working at Fermilab 
starting already yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Now, my testimony comes at a very crucial time for the U.S. 
Particle Physics Program. LBNF and DUNE received approval to 
start construction, and with the Omnibus Bill we can now 
provide sufficient funding for construction. Cessation in 
funding will lead to increased costs and delays and curtailing 
of the current momentum. Sustained funding will signal, in 
fact, to our partners across the wall, that the United States 
is absolutely determined and prepared to lead in science and 
make the case for the future, that science leadership, 
discovery, and innovation are essential aspects of our Nation's 
technological and economical growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">And I will take my last minute to talk a little bit about 
technology and workforce development after mentioning that the 
U.S., the United States, in this area, in the frontier of the 
cosmic--what we call in this area--we are already leaders, and 
we are doing dark matter and dark energy exploration and we 
will continue with sustained funding doing so. Dark matter is 
important, because it is the gravitational scaffolding of the 
universe. Without dark matter, galaxies and stars would fly 
away. We must understand what it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Going to the technology, fundamental research is crucially 
dependent on advanced technology. We are adapting right now 
what technology has developed for quantum computers essential 
for these dark matter searches, pushing farther the advancement 
of these technologies, important applications of particle 
physics-spun areas of manufacturing, computation, medicine, and 
national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Particle physics detectors improve homeland security using 
advanced technology and providing new techniques for monitoring 
the core of nuclear reactors. And when the motivation to 
generate new technology lies within deeper scientific 
questions, it is then that we make unprecedented leaps in 
technology and in the domain sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">Finally, particle physics--you probably know it from the 
many times we come in front of you--we are the source of the 
biggest, absolute biggest data, and absolute biggest and more 
complex data architectures. This, as a consequence, that our 
particle physics students and the young researchers today are 
expertly versed in all these artificial intelligence methods 
and tools for science, for basic science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Ms. Kaptur">I would like to highlight one example of a recent graduate 
of mine, Alex Mott. He received his Ph.D. in 2015 from Cal-
Tech, and he was handpicked by the Tesla model Autopilot team, 
and he developed from Version 0 to Version 9 now the Autopilot 
for Tesla Motors. This is happening with our students. This is 
just one example. This is happening with our students all over.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Wednesday, May 3, 2017.
MORRY MARKOWITZ, PRESIDENT, FUEL CELL AND HYDROGEN ENERGY ASSOCIATION</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Markowitz. I want to thank the Chair and the Ranking 
Member for giving me this opportunity to discuss our industry's 
priorities for fiscal year 2018 funding for the Department of 
Energy. My name is Morry Markowitz. I am president of the Fuel 
Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Simpson">I previously submitted written testimony to the committee, 
but I would like to have this opportunity to have a 
conversation with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Simpson">The member companies that make up the Fuel Cell and 
Hydrogen Energy Association range in size from some of the 
best-known household brands in the world to small businesses 
and startups. We also count national laboratories and other 
nonprofits within our family. Looking around at the 
subcommittee, I could see we are well represented here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Simpson">The industry currently employs approximately 10,000 direct 
workers in the United States through manufacturing, 
maintenance, engineering, and supply chain support, and 
thousands more in indirect jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We often refer to the fuel cell technology as the all-the-
above technology, meaning it applies to stationary and 
distributed power generation, backup power for 
telecommunications, material handling, and transportation, 
including passenger vehicles, buses, and soon trains and heavy 
vehicles. We utilize all the above fuels because we can drive 
hydrogen from 100 percent domestic resources, including natural 
gas, bio and landfill gas, to renewables such as solar and 
wind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Our industry, with the help of the Department of Energy, 
has made incredible strides in developing this transformational 
clean energy technology. Passenger cars are now being sold and 
leased in California. Stationary power is being used by some of 
the leading utilities and companies from around the world. Fuel 
cell forklifts are taking the place of old battery types in the 
largest distribution centers in North America. However, even 
with all this progress, there is still a great deal left to 
accomplish in making this technology more competitive in the 
marketplace. And that is why I am here to speak to you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Simpson">For fiscal year 2018, our organization is asking that the 
committee positively consider our request for $101 million in 
funding for hydrogen and fuel cell activities managed by the 
Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and $50 
million for solid oxide fuel research and development managed 
by the Office of Fossil Energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We know that this is an era of tight budgets. That is why 
our request for fiscal year 2018 EERE budget is identical to 
the appropriated level of this year, and our Office of Fossil 
Energy Funding request is identical to what we requested for 
2017. The members of FCHEA truly appreciate the consistent 
level of bipartisan support given to these programs by this 
committee, Congress, and past administrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Simpson">If we were to be asked how money for EER would be best put 
to work at the Department of Energy, I would provide you with 
the following response. It is the industry's opinion that the 
bulk of appropriated monies should focus on three main areas: 
hydrogen research and development, market transformation, and 
stationary and storage applications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Simpson">For hydrogen research and development, we ask for funds to 
further enhance hydrogen metering devices, for retail fueling 
stations, improve hydrogen compressors, and reduce the costs of 
storage and transport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In addition, the department should identify competitive 
opportunities to help develop robust, affordable hydrogen 
infrastructure components. This would encourage entrance to the 
markets, drive down costs, and speed transition. As a package, 
all these proposed ideas will help in the development of a 
reliable and cost-effective infrastructure. The department 
should also continue modest proof of concept demonstrations. 
These activities have proven successful for material handling 
equipment at warehouses and show significant progress for air 
and sea ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Market transformation funding enables fuel cell and vehicle 
companies to overcome cost-prohibitive steps, that has the best 
chance to perform well against environmentally problematic 
incumbent technology. Within the stationary generation 
application sector, we are encouraged by the committee's 
recognition of the role that fuel cells and hydrogen can play 
in energy storage. Excess power can be utilized to generate 
hydrogen for future electricity generation, transportation 
fuel, and for use in the natural gas pipeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Finally, with regard to EERE, we continue to call for the 
committee to encourage the Secretary of Energy to work with the 
Secretary of Transportation on coordinating efforts to deploy 
hydrogen fueling infrastructure, particularly as part of a 
major investment in U.S. infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Concerning the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Program managed by the 
Office of Fossil Energy, our request for $50 million would 
continue essential R&amp;D in support of the development of large-
scale, highly-efficient ultra clean stationary power generation 
fuel cell systems. This program is the only one of its kind 
globally, providing the U.S. with a unique competitive 
advantage over foreign competitors. Solid oxide fuel cells 
utilize domestic fuels that include classified coal, natural 
gas, bio gas, hydrogen, and biodiesel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Completion of this work will result in ultra-efficient 
stationary power systems for the distributed as well as central 
power applications. Success continues in reaching performance 
milestones for durability and cost. This essential R&amp;D must 
continue in order to reach the requirements for successful 
introducing of solid oxide fuel cell technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Modern-day fuel cells are the result of American ingenuity, 
which played a key role in our quest in landing a man on the 
moon. We believe that this transformational, clean technology 
will play a role in addressing many of our energy and 
transportation challenges. If we make the right decisions 
today, we will ensure that future high-quality jobs will be 
created here while at the same time improving our economy and 
environment, bolstering our national security, and making us 
energy independent. We look forward to working with you and the 
committee staff as the process continues.</paragraph>

KATERI CALLAHAN, PRESIDENT, ALLIANCE TO SAVE ENERGY</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Callahan. Hi. Thank you very much. I really appreciate 
the opportunity to testify before you today, Mr. Chairman and 
Ranking Member Kaptur. And I want to lay out and highlight the 
critical and cost-effective, energy-effective energy efficiency 
programs being carried out at the Office of Energy Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Simpson">I want to start, like so many others have, in saying thank 
you to you and the other members of the committee for your 
longstanding support of Federal energy efficiency programs. We 
were really encouraged by the Omnibus Bill, which includes 
robust funding for these programs. And to say thank you, I am 
going to try to buy you back a minute or two of the time that 
you are running over today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Simpson">My name is Kateri Callahan, and I serve as the president of 
the Alliance to Save Energy. We are a bipartisan, nonprofit 
organization with the mission of advancing national policies 
that make our economy more energy productive, and that results 
in creation of jobs, reduction of energy costs for consumers 
and businesses, increased global competitiveness, and, of 
course, reduction in the harmful emissions associated with 
energy production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Simpson">The Alliance enjoys the leadership of 13 members of 
Congress who serve in an honorary capacity on our Board of 
Directors. We also enjoy the support of over 120 companies and 
institutions that help us in our advocacy, education, 
communications, and market transformation work. We are 
celebrating our 40th anniversary this year, and over those past 
four decades, we witnessed a remarkable decoupling in the 
growth in energy demand in this country from the growth in our 
economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Today, we are twice as energy productive as we were in the 
late 1970s. What does that mean? That means we are getting two 
times--twice--as much GDP for each unit of energy that we 
consume, so we are much more energy productive. And what did 
that do? In the creation of this real evolution or transition 
in our energy use, we have created an enormous and a domestic-
based energy efficiency industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Mr. Simpson">You have heard a lot of the other witnesses today talk 
about the 2.2 million jobs that have been created. I brought 
along a visual to just kind of emphasize and highlight this for 
you. You can see that it is 2.2 of the 3 million clean energy 
jobs. But the bigger story is, it is a third of the jobs in the 
overall energy sector in the U.S. You can also see that the 
majority of these jobs are in the construction and the 
manufacturing sectors, so these are largely nonexportable and 
good-paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Simpson">One thing that others have not pointed out is that it is a 
rapidly growing industry. We realized 6 percent growth between 
2015 and 2016 in this industry, and we are expecting another 9 
percent growth just this year. And these jobs can be found all 
across the United States. It is detailed in my testimony. But, 
for example, in your district, Mr. Simpson, there are over 900 
energy efficiency jobs. And, Ms. Kaptur, in your district in 
Ohio, there are 4,200 energy efficiency jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. And I think that is a low number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Callahan. And I would agree with you, but we always 
err on the side of being cautious and conservative. In total 
for the committee, there are 46,000 jobs that are represented 
just in the districts of the committee members. It is 
impossible to understate the role of Federal policies and 
investment, from building energy codes, to appliance and 
equipment and efficiency standards, to public and private 
partnerships in this remarkable evolution, to an economy that 
is doing much more with less in terms of energy consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Simpson">For this reason, we are requesting funding at levels at 
least equivalent to those you included in the Omnibus, and in a 
few instances have suggested slight increases to keep programs. 
As detailed in my testimony, the energy efficiency programs at 
DOE are paying out huge returns to consumers and businesses on 
the modest taxpayer investments. There are just three quick 
examples that I want to call to your attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Mr. Simpson">First is the State Energy Program, or SEP, that is 
currently funded at $50 million. We join with the others in 
requesting a $20 million increase to this program, which is 
delivering direct energy savings of $7 for every $1 of Federal 
support. The second is the Weatherization Assistance Program. 
And you have heard chapter and verse on that. We join with the 
others in requesting a modest increase of $5 million to the 
$230 million level for a program that has a cost-benefit ratio 
of 4 to 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Mr. Simpson">One thing that has not been talked a lot about today, that 
I have heard, is the Building Technology Office. That is where 
we house the Appliance and Equipment Standards Program, which 
is saving consumers, through the standards that we put in 
place, $500 a year on their energy bill, and also houses the 
Building Energy Codes Program. New homes that are built to 
codes certified by DOE through that program can expect a net 
savings in as little as 1 to 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Again, these are just examples of the programs that are 
detailed. All of them have that kind of cost-effective, 
impactful benefit to our economy, so we urge you to continue to 
provide robust funding in support of these programs. We believe 
the return on investment to our economy and also to our energy 
security and our environment is simply too large to pass up. 
Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Mr. Simpson">[The information follows:]</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Wednesday, May 3, 2017.
WILLIAM ``DUB'' TAYLOR, DIRECTOR, TEXAS STATE ENERGY CONSERVATION</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Taylor. Thank you, sir. My name is William ``Dub'' 
Taylor and I serve as the State Energy Office director from 
Texas. It is an honor to appear before the subcommittee today 
on behalf of the National Association of State Energy 
Officials, or NASEO. NASEO represents the governor-designated 
energy officials from every State in U.S. territory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Simpson">It is a forum for us to share good ideas on all of the 
above energy solutions and to cooperate regionally and 
nationally. I want to thank Chairman Simpson, Ranking Member 
Kaptur, and the subcommittee for your support of $50 million 
for the State Energy Program, or SEP, and $225 million for the 
Weatherization Assistance Program, and the fiscal year 2017 
House bill last spring and as part of this week's budget deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Simpson">First and foremost, I am here today asking the subcommittee 
for support of $70 million for SEP in fiscal year 2018. In 
addition to seeking $50 million in base SEP formula funds, we 
think that additional targeted funding to enhance Federal 
energy cooperation in energy emergency preparedness and 
response, including physical and cybersecurity of the energy 
infrastructure, should be provided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Energy emergency preparedness is a necessity and is a 
highly interdependent Federal, State, private function, 
covering electricity, natural gas, petroleum, and other fuels. 
In the most recent year in which we have data, nearly 50 
percent of the cyber attacks in the United States were on 
energy infrastructure, with significant activity in the 
petroleum sector, much of that in my own State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Second, we strongly disagree with the administration's 
proposals to eliminate SEP and Weatherization on the basis that 
it may interfere with State policymaking. I can tell you, the 
States know SEP as the only daily administered program which 
embodies cooperative Federalism and affords governors control 
of allocating funds within very broad guidelines, as intended 
by the Congress, all without unnecessary Federal Government 
interference in State policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In fact, governor support for SEP and Weatherization is 
extraordinary. This year, the National Governors Association 
called out SEP and Weatherization as top funding priorities in 
the energy area, urging the Trump administration to ``continue 
and expand the Weatherization Assistance Program and State 
Energy Program.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Moreover, the Southern States Energy Board, led by 
Governors Hutchinson of Arkansas and Adkins of Kentucky, the 
Governors' Wind &amp; Solar Energy Coalition led by Governors 
Raimondo of Rhode Island and Brownback of Kansas, and the 
Western Interstate Energy Board, led by the energy directors, 
my counterparts, Governors Herbert of Utah and Sandoval of 
Nevada, all call for continued and expanding funding of SEP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Simpson">SEP is a strong Federal-State partnership program and it 
requires matching State funds. According to two Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory studies, one just referred to by Ms. 
Callahan, SEP provides taxpayers with exceptional value. Oak 
Ridge found that each dollar of SEP funds used by States 
leverages $10.71 of State and private funds and realizes $7.22 
in energy cost savings for citizens and businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In Texas, like most States, we are focused on the role of 
energy and economic development. Diverse energy resources and 
low energy prices provide Texas with an advantage, and we want 
to keep it that way. As an example, in Texas we leverage 
$293,000 in SEP funds to support clean energy technology 
startup companies, which have attracted $7 million in 
investments, created 86 jobs, and resulted in $7.9 million in 
economic impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We have allocated SEP funding to the Texas Industries of 
the Future Program, which has had great success in supporting 
chemical manufacturers and refiners, to decrease the energy and 
water intensity of their Texas operations. And we utilized SEP 
funds to support local building energy code adoption and 
compliance by training homebuilders, contractors, and code 
officials across the State. Each of these successes and others 
are possible using the flexible SEP formula funds, which give 
our States and other States the ability to allocate funding to 
meet our top energy priorities and opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In Texas, SEP funds are also used to conduct energy and 
water assessments for public sector, taxpayer-supported 
facilities across the State. Projects identified can then be 
implemented under the State-funded LoneSTAR Revolving Loan 
Program, which offers low-cost financing to K-12 schools, local 
governments, and State agencies. This program has awarded 
almost 300 loans totaling $375 million for projects that have 
saved borrowers $523 million in utility costs, an average of 
18.5 savings annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Finally, we would prefer that all SEP funds come to the 
States through the base formula account rather than the small 
competitive program or technical assistance which DOE has opted 
to undertake at its discretion over the past several years. We 
look forward to working with the subcommittee, with the 
Congress, and the new administration in advancing our energy 
policies and the good work of the States and private sector.</paragraph>

ROBERT JOHNSON, VICE PRESIDENT, HANNON ARMSTRONG</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Johnson. Good afternoon, and thank you for having me 
here. In the interest of time, I will try to be brief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We are a leading venture in the sustainable infrastructure 
and energy business and we are urging your support in funding 
of the Federal Energy Management Program, specifically FEMP. It 
is an important program that oversees and facilitates the 
implementation of energy savings performance contracts, or 
ESPCs as they are known, as well as utility energy services 
contracts, UESCs as they are known; these activities all of 
which are currently contemplated in the 2018 Energy and Water 
Development Appropriations Bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Simpson">To give you a little background on who Hannon Armstrong is, 
we are a 36-year-old company, New York Stock Exchange listed, 
and ticker symbol HSAI. We invest in energy infrastructure to 
the extent that it is energy efficiency wind and solar 
projects. To give you an idea, we have approximately 23,000 
acres of land that we own underneath wind and solar projects, 
some of which is here with some of the members of this 
committee, Mr. Fortenberry as well as Mr. Calvert. In each of 
those cases, we own approximately 7 megawatts of power that is 
being generated in a distributed manner in each of their 
locations. I, unfortunately, cannot say the same right now for 
the two jurisdictions that we have in attendance today, but I 
am sure that we will over time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Katpur. Excuse me, sir, you have to deal with the 
birders in Ohio. Yeah, yeah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Johnson. I apologize. Specifically, I want to talk a 
little bit about ESPCs and UESCs. These critical contracts, 
they enable the Federal agencies to procure energy services and 
projects without relying solely on appropriated funds and they 
come at no added cost to the government. ESPCs and UESCs are 
tools that help agencies and installations replace, operate, 
and maintain aging energy using equipment. They reduce energy 
and intensity, as Kateri had mentioned before, saving taxpayer 
dollars, creating jobs, and in many cases improving the mission 
readiness of the Federal agencies. These innovative contracts 
require that each of the ESCOs that underpin the contracts 
perform annual assurance of the financial savings that are 
realized through these contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Simpson">ESPCs and UESCs also have resulted in thousands of jobs 
created. So we have talked about jobs today in a variety of 
contexts. In this context, it is in the Federal ESPC and UESC 
world where the Federal Performance Contracting Coalition, FPC, 
in particular, has estimated that approximately for every $10 
million of investment made in ESPCs and UESCs there are 95 
high-paying jobs available here in the U.S. These jobs work in 
three areas. One is manufacturing, so manufacturing the 
equipment that is put in; two is the installers through 
subcontractors and the like; and three are the ESCOs, or the 
Energy Services Companies, that do the work as a prime 
contractor to the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Simpson">FEMP in particular is authorized to track agency progress 
on particularly section 432 of the Energy Independence and 
Security Act of 2007. In this capacity, they facilitate report 
findings of implemented projects and report annual building 
benchmarking metrics. In addition, FEMP is authorized by 
statute to appropriate procedures and methods for use by 
Federal agencies with these ESPCs, in particular on 42 U.S.C. 
8287.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In addition, FEMP's most important effort is the 
coordinated and defined program management of ESPCs for the 
Federal agencies. FEMP staff helps agencies use ESPCs in 
several ways, advising the agencies on scoping and procurement 
activities, helping agencies select third party energy services 
companies, which I mentioned before, finalizing contract terms 
and project approval, and monitoring the project implementation 
and performance of these contracts over the long period of 
time, which can be up to 25 years in many cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Simpson">FEMP is the program manager for this critical ESPC 
contracting tool used by Federal agencies to implement ESPCs. 
That is the Department of Energy ESPC, what is called an 
indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, IDIQ, contract. This 
was recently, the third version of this was recently announced 
last week by the Department of Energy where there are 21 new 
contractors now awarded that contract under the DOE ESPC IDIQ. 
This new contract is an essential tool for Federal agencies and 
installations on the military side to continue achieving 
greater savings for the taxpayers and obviously promote the 
additional job creation that we have just mentioned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In closing, we strongly urge that the $28 million in 
funding for FEMP that has been proposed in the 2018 budget be 
approved so FEMP can continue its vital work, in particular on 
the ESPCs front with Federal agencies. We thank you for 
providing this opportunity and look forward to any questions 
and comments you may have.</paragraph>

WILLIAM K. DRUMMOND, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MID-WEST ELECTRIC CONSUMERS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Drummond. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member 
Kaptur. My name is Bill Drummond. I am the executive director 
of Mid-West Electric Consumers Association. Mid-West represents 
about 300 not-for-profit utilities that purchase power from the 
Federal hydroelectric facilities on the Missouri River and its 
tributaries under the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. The 
projects are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and 
the Bureau of Reclamation and the power is sold by Western Area 
Power Administration or WAPA. This cost-based, renewable, non-
carbon emitting power is an essential component of my members' 
power supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mid-West member utilities purchase almost 3,000 megawatts 
of installed capacity and the associated energy under long-term 
contracts, some of which extend beyond 2050. In exchange for 
these long-term commitments to purchase WAPA power, Mid-West 
members pay rates that recover the capital costs of the Federal 
investment plus interest in the hydropower generation and 
transmission facilities. Hydropower's share of the joint costs 
including the dams and the spillways and other project purposes 
costs that are assigned by Congress to hydropower 
beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Mr. Simpson">WAPA's rates also recover the annual operation and 
maintenance costs of the hydropower facilities. WAPA's and the 
other three power marketing administrations cost-based rates 
are not subsidized by the United States Treasury or the 
taxpayer. Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 requires 
that the power marketing administrations' market Federal power 
at cost-based rates. Prior administrations have recommended 
raising the power marketing administration rates to market-
based rather than the present cost-based system. Congress has 
consistently reaffirmed the use of cost-based rates for the 
power marketing administrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Mr. Simpson">There have also been proposals to privatize the PMAs by 
selling them to the highest bidder. Mid-West urges you to 
reject any proposed sale of the power marketing administrations 
or the imposition of market-based rates. These ill-advised 
proposals would have a devastating impact on the fragile rural 
economy of the Upper Great Plains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Second, the members of Mid-West want to thank the 
subcommittee for the proposal to reduce WAPA's net zero 
appropriation, also known as offsetting discretionary spending 
in the Omnibus Spending Bill for fiscal year 2017. That 
proposal is a reduction of $37 million from the fiscal year 
2016 levels. We support a continuation of that reduction into 
2018 and beyond to address a double budgeting issue with the 
Parker-Davis Intertie Projects. So unlike a lot of other folks, 
we are actually here requesting a reduction and appreciate the 
subcommittee's support for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. We will mark that down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Drummond. Finally, Mid-West has a good working 
relationship with WAPA and its sister Federal agencies, the 
Corps, and the Bureau of Reclamation regarding the flow of 
current and rejected financial information. While Mid-West 
members still have healthy disagreements with some of WAPA's 
and the Corps' and Reclamation's spending proposals, we have 
been able to work together to obtain the data we need to be 
able to provide informed comments. We respect the efforts of 
the employees and the leadership of these agencies in managing 
these Federal assets under complicated circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Mr. Simpson">So in conclusion, Mid-West members strongly support the 
Western Area Power Administration and will oppose any efforts 
to sell it or the other power marketing administrations or to 
change to market-based rates. We support a $35 million 
reduction in WAPA's net zero appropriation request for fiscal 
year 2017 and appreciate the subcommittee's support of the 
fiscal year 2017 Omnibus Spending Proposal that calls for a $37 
million reduction. And finally, we appreciate the working 
relationship that we have with WAPA, the Corps and the Bureau 
of Reclamation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Mr. Simpson">So thank you for the opportunity to testify this afternoon 
and I look forward to any questions you may have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Simpson">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. Mr. Chairman, I do have a question of this 
witness. For the record, thank you so much for testifying. I am 
trying to still secure in my own mind the different rates that 
consumers, businesses, industries pay across the country for 
kilowatt hour, for usage, depending on the type of energy 
system that they are subject to. I am wondering sir, if you 
could provide the per kilowatt cost on average to your 
residential consumers, your industrial consumers, and then if 
there are specials in the rural areas, I would like to know 
what those are, and I want to compare those to my region of the 
county, which has a very different energy umbrella than your 
own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Drummond. Certainly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. That would be very valuable to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Drummond. No, I would be happy to provide that. I do 
not have it with me right today. I can tell you that for most 
of my members, the cost of power that they get from their--not 
only the Western Area Power Administration, but also their 
other power suppliers amounts on average to about half of their 
total cost of doing business. The rest of the cost of doing 
business includes distribution systems, the back office that is 
necessary to provide bills, the power management systems, et 
cetera. So that is roughly how the wholesale supply versus the 
other costs of doing business work out. But I can get you our 
average cost of supplying that power. I would be happy to do 
that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. Thank you so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Drummond. Yes, ma'am.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Mr. Simpson">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Wednesday, May 3, 2017.
JORGE S. CANACA, DIRECTOR OF FEDERAL RELATIONS AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Canaca. Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member and 
subcommittee members, thank you for holding this hearing and 
providing the opportunity for public testimony. My name is 
Jorge Canaca. I am the director of Federal relations and 
regulatory affairs for the Grand Canyon State Electric 
Cooperative Association. We are a regional service organization 
representing the interests of electric cooperative utilities 
and their customers and submit the following testimony which 
will focus on the Western Area Power Administration's budget 
practices, the need for budget transparency and the need for 
customer involvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We respectfully request the subcommittee provide adequate 
funding for Western to meet its primary statutory obligations 
to market, sell, and transmit preference power. However, due to 
potential agency-wide customer impact and the inappropriate 
nature of double budgeting practices, we recommend that 
Western's net zero request be reduced in the fiscal year 2018 
budget by 35 million and by equivalent amounts in future fiscal 
years until Western corrects the situation through budget 
formulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We further ask the subcommittee to cap the use of net zero 
authority to ensure that it is not duplicative of funding the 
Desert Southwest Region Office already receives through 
prepayment authority. The Grand Canyon Electric Cooperative 
Association is a member organization consisting of six electric 
distribution and generation transmission cooperatives who 
collectively service approximately 500,000 rural residents 
across Arizona. Our member cooperatives are customer-owned, 
not-for-profit utilities and on average one-third of our 
members live at or below the Federal poverty level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Now, for 75 years, electric cooperatives have been proud to 
keep the lights on by providing safe, reliable, and affordable 
electricity and America's 838 not-for-profit electric 
distribution cooperatives provide service to 42 million people 
in 47 States, and collectively, their service territories cover 
75 percent of the U.S. land mass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Now, under the Reclamation Project Act and Flood Control 
Act, as Bill mentioned earlier, Western is required to market 
preference power at the lowest possible rates to customers 
consistent with sound business practices. Electric cooperatives 
were some of the first purchasers of Federal hydropower 
delivered to homes, farms, ranches, and rural businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Currently, Western relies on congressional appropriations 
and funds generated directly by customer-owned utilities that 
are power contractors to maintain its capital program mission. 
From a budget scoring perspective, Western is considered budget 
neutral and not a draw on the Treasury. This is only possible 
because preference power customers reimburse the cost of 
Western's capital investment through rates and are thus 
ultimately responsible for repayment of the Federal investment. 
Now, to that end, we support continued funding for Western to 
meet its statutory mission. We believe Western is a valued 
partner. But recently, however, we have witnessed Western's 
financial practices come under scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Mr. Simpson">A 2015 GAO report identified concerns with management and 
size of unobligated balances held by Western and recommended 
that Western implement a strategy and take action to reduce 
these balances. Now, while we applaud Western for addressing a 
self-created financial mismanagement issue, and returning 
hundreds of millions of dollars to the Treasury, the electric 
cooperative customers believe the accrual of unobligated 
balances was a direct result of net zero budget authority 
granted to Western in 2010. So that is the double budgeting 
issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Now, therefore, we also ask the subcommittee to rescind $70 
million in unobligated balances accrued through the use of 
prepayment authority and the net zero appropriations. According 
to its own estimates, Western returned 328 million to the 
Treasury Reclamation Fund in fiscal year 2016 and a total of 
894 in the previous 5 years. Yet, during that same period, our 
electric rates increased by 32 percent. These increases in both 
power rates and unobligated balances occurred during a period 
when the government was operating under continuing resolutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And in conclusion, I would just like to add that Western 
has pursued expanded budget authority while systematic funding 
problems surfaced. With respect to some of Western's major 
projects, customers did not have timely, meaningful 
participation in Western's 10-year planning and Federal budget 
development. And most importantly, much of Western's financial 
processes and decision-making schedules are not transparent to 
the customer. By working together, Congress, Western, and 
preference power customers can address the multiple goals and 
challenges of Federal hydropower resource and maximize the 
benefit of the system for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Now, let me conclude my testimony by thanking the members 
of the subcommittee for their support and special thanks to 
Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar for his continued leadership in 
the House on this important issue to Arizona's electric rate 
payers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Simpson">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. All right, thank you for being here today and 
for your testimony, and as you can tell, I have a habit of 
hammering people's names, and I apologize for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Canaca. It is perfectly fine, sir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I would like to also 
ask this witness if you could provide for the record, follow-up 
on page 4 of your testimony, you say your rate payers paid 
electric rates for cooperative customers increased by an 
average of 6.5 percent each year. Could you provide an updated 
summary for our committee of the per kilowatt cost of energy 
for your customers in the residential and industrial and rural 
consumer arenas? Can you do that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Canaca. Absolutely. I would be happy to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. Thank you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Mr. Simpson">IRRIGATION AND ELECTRICAL DISTRICTS' ASSOCIATION OF AZ
ROBERT S. LYNCH, COUNSEL TO THE IRRIGATION AND ELECTRICAL DISTRICTS'</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Mr. Simpson">ASSOCIATION OF AZ, ROBERT S. LYNCH &amp; ASSOCIATES</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Lynch. I am Bob Lynch and I am an attorney in Phoenix, 
Arizona. Let me first talk to you about the net zero concept. 
When it was originally authorized, it was authorized for Pick-
Sloan, Bill Drummond's group that he represents is the majority 
of their customers. And we went along with it, but it was not 
supposed to apply in the Colorado River Basin. We did not need 
it, we did not want it. And just our way of explaining it to 
you is, well, I have an 8-year-old granddaughter. She is smart, 
she is good looking, she is talented. But if I took her 
shopping, would I give her my credit card? No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Well, in our view, the way this worked out in the Desert 
Southwest Region, WAPA has a net zero credit card, except we do 
not get to see the shopping list. All we see is what they 
bought when they hand us the bill. And we are trying to work to 
change that. We established a preference customer committee 
with the co-ops and the MUNIs to try to have a dialogue with 
Western, WAPA, to see if we can straighten this out. But for 
now, we are out of luck. What we found out just recently, 
within the last couple of weeks, is that last spring, the 
Desert Southwest Office started converting all of their 
advanced funding that we had been paying for, including O&amp;M, to 
net zero. And so they were taking, you know, our existing rate 
and paying and we were paying, and we were paying in, and 
paying the O&amp;M and they were converting it to this net zero 
appropriation, which accounts for part of the double budgeting 
issue that you have heard about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We think we can fix it, but it is going to require their 
cooperation. And if we do not get the cooperation, I would 
respectfully request the opportunity to come back here and tell 
you all about it and tell you what I think ought to happen to 
them because it is happening to us now and it needs fixing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Mr. Simpson">On the transparency issue, WAPA is very transparent about 
what they have done to us. They are just not very transparent 
about what they are going to do to us next. And we have got to 
try to fix that, also. And if we do not get it fixed, we will 
be back again asking for your help. And one of the things that 
has come up in all of this is consolidation. WAPA has 
consolidated a lot of functions in their headquarters. In 2010, 
they had 260 FTEs; starting in fiscal year 2018, they will have 
390. Not all those folks live in Denver. Some of them are in 
Sacramento and Loveland and Phoenix and every other place while 
the problem is they do not talk to us. If you are somebody in 
Sacramento doing something for the whole agency, why do you 
care what people in Phoenix think? And to the best of our 
knowledge, they are not being asked to talk to us. So to us, 
consolidation has turned out to be the enemy of cooperation. 
And we do not know exactly how to fix that, to tell you the 
truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. Simpson">A couple of things happened on Monday that sort of changed 
my testimony. Number one, in the explanatory statement for the 
Consolidated Appropriation Bill, on page 41, there is a comment 
about termination provisions in contracts and you are telling 
Western, give us a report in 60 days. Well, I lived it, 
starting in the 70's, just in case you would like to hear the 
rest of the story, I would be happy to supply it to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Mr. Simpson">The other thing is that there is a $34 million 
authorization for 2017 to reduce unobligated balances, but it 
says ``may.'' Now, in the Clinton administration, a colleague 
of mine who was solicitor of the Department of the Interior 
wrote to Bruce Babbitt and said, if it is in the bill, you have 
got to obey it; if it is in the committee report, you do not. 
So I do not know what ``may'' means or what you think ``may'' 
means in that explanatory statement, but I would caution you to 
keep an eye on this because if they do not reduce it, then that 
35 million we are all asking for could be 69 or 70 and we would 
be happy to have it. And to the best of my knowledge, it would 
not bother Western at all in terms of their budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Mr. Simpson">So thank you for the opportunity to be here today and talk 
to you about these important subjects, because they do affect 
the pocketbooks of an awful lot of folk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Simpson">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you. I appreciate your testimony. And 
``may'' means they may or they may not. And ``shall'' means 
they shall. And the history is, that if it is in bill language, 
they do have to follow it. In report language, it is strongly 
suggested that they follow it because next year they are going 
to have to be answerable for it. So that is kind of where it 
ranks in everything. But we thank you for being here and for 
your testimony. Thank you, sir.</paragraph>

NICKI FULLER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SOUTHWESTERN POWER RESOURCES</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Fuller. Thank you, sir. And I believe I am the last 
person to talk about the PMAs, so you will only have to hear 
about this one more time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. Okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Fuller. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. 
My name is Nicki Fuller and I am the executive director of the 
Southwestern Power Resources Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Mr. Simpson">I come before you today as a bit of a unicorn. I am a 
grateful constituent, a happy customer, and we have a Federal 
program that works and pay its own way, without any cost to the 
taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In addition, I am proud of the hard work we have done in my 
region to protect the Federal infrastructure, to ensure we have 
a program that is successful and sustainable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Mr. Simpson">SPRA is a non-for-profit organization of rural electric 
cooperatives and public power systems in Arkansas, Kansas, 
Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas, that are customers of 
the Southwestern Power Administration, which is part of the 
Department of Energy. Southwestern markets hydroelectric power 
generated at 24 multipurpose dams in the region. SPRA members 
serve over 8.2 million end users in this region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Unlike most Federal programs, the PMAs like Southwestern 
pay their own way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Every Federal dollar spent on Federal hydropower program is 
repaid through the rates charged to the customers. This 
includes all costs of generating and marketing the 
hydroelectric energy and capacity incurred by both the Corps 
and the PMA, plus interest on capital costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Southwestern receives a diminishing amount of 
appropriations every year in Congress in the amount of about 
$11 million, or 7 percent of their total operating budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Mr. Simpson">These appropriations plus all other expenses for 
Southwestern and for the Corps' cost for hydropower and a 
percentage of joint use expenses are included in the rates the 
customers pay. The taxpayers do not subsidize or pay for any 
activity of any PMA, including Southwestern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Mr. Simpson">As you will likely note from the testimony of other PMA 
customer groups across the country today, each PMA is very 
different. Cooperation between Southwestern and its customers 
is a primary mission of SPRA. Quarterly, Southwestern updates 
my board on all issues of importance and asks for input. This 
transparency is the key to our long and successful relationship 
as business partners. The established practice of frequent 
communication has allowed these issues to be addressed in a 
manner which is fair to all parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Today, I will discuss two issues which are very important 
to SPRA and its members. They are, one, the need for increased 
financial flexibility of Southwestern and, two, customer 
funding of Federal infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Mr. Simpson">One, the system of Southwestern is very dependent upon rain 
and does not have the capacity to withstand a long-term 
drought. Regardless of the water conditions, Southwestern has a 
contractual obligation to my members to deliver the power it 
guarantees. For this reason, during a drought Southwestern must 
purchase power and these costs are passed through the power 
rates to the customers. SPRA has asked Southwestern if there is 
a way to pay for these purchases incrementally in advance to 
reduce rate spikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Mr. Simpson">To achieve this incremental collection, Southwestern would 
need an account in the U.S. Treasury with the authority to hold 
funds across fiscal years with the ability to access it when 
needed. Unfortunately, this financial flexibility that is 
commonsense business practice has not been able to pass the 
legislative hurdles necessary for use. Financial flexibility 
tools such as the one mentioned above are key to the continued 
success of Southwestern. As energy and capacity markets become 
more evolved, Southwestern must have the ability to act 
consistent with sound business principles as it is statutorily 
obligated to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. May I ask you, is there legislation to do 
what you are suggesting here that has been introduced in 
Congress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Fuller. There was last session and it scored. We are 
not sure why it scored. It is just a savings account in the 
Treasury. So it was not able to pass because of that reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. Okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. Introduce the legislation, please?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Fuller. Sure. It was in the Senate and it was Cassidy 
and McCaskill from Missouri and Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="579" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. Okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Fuller. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Mr. Simpson">The financial flexibility not only makes good business 
sense, it is highly desired by us, the customers, to pay the 
rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Mr. Simpson">My second point, customer-funding. With all the discussion 
of public-private partnerships, or P3, I want to inform the 
subcommittee about a long successful P3 program in our region. 
Beginning in the 1990s, Federal power customers began noticing 
increased outages of Corps hydropower plants which was causing 
the PMAs to have to purchase expensive replacement power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Even though there was an increase in outages due to 
maintenance issues, SPRA saw significantly decreased 
appropriations for maintenance of this infrastructure. With 
this in mind, SPRA in partnership with the Corps in 
Southwestern, put together the trust MOA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Under this agreement, the customers meet with the Corps and 
Southwestern to determine the funding needs for the following 
fiscal year. This cooperative process allows the customers, the 
ones that pay the expenses, to have input on how their money is 
spent and it allows the Corps to have a predictable revenue 
stream to sustain this Federal infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We have committed to the Corps that we will fund through 
the trust MOA about $2.4 billion for hydropower infrastructure 
over the next 30 years to complete rehabilitation of all 24 
Corps hydropower plants marketed by Southwestern. Through this 
process, we are able to keep local control and oversight, 
sustain Federal infrastructure, and ensure the longevity and 
future of the Federal hydropower program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In conclusion, I come to you today in the rare and enviable 
position of a constituent and customer that is happy. Unlike 
other Federal programs, this program costs the taxpayers 
absolutely nothing, yet benefits millions of citizens while 
investing in Federal infrastructure assets. These dams provide 
so many benefits to my region, including navigation, flood 
control, water supply, environmental programs, and recreation. 
Without the Federal hydropower customers paying the bills, more 
of these costs of these joint activities would be borne on the 
taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony. Thank you for 
allowing me to come here today to discuss this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Mr. Simpson">[The information follows:]</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="604" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Collins. Good afternoon. Chairman Simpson, thank you, 
members of this committee, for allowing me to speak before you 
today and to offer my comments on the important role of the 
Appalachian Regional Commission plays in supporting the 420 
counties across our 13 States. The ARC works tirelessly 
alongside our local development districts, nonprofit 
organizations and the States to bring our respective ARC 
regions into socioeconomic parity with the rest of this great

around us. We get so focused on what is right in front of us, 
that we lose sight of areas like Appalachia and we fail to 
recognize that not everyone in this great Nation has the same 
opportunities afforded to them as maybe you or I do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Mr. Simpson">I do myself not hail from Appalachia, but I have become a 
huge supporter of the ARC program. And have seen up close and 
very personal the impact this funding has had on our businesses 
and our citizens alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Mr. Simpson">On a recent visit to the Scranton School for the Deaf and 
Hard of Hearing Children, I was able to see firsthand the 
impact ARC funds are having on our most valuable assets, our 
children. This specialized school, located in Scranton, 
Pennsylvania, is a nonprofit, tuition-free school that serves 
children from birth to eighth grade. The school's mission is to 
prepare each deaf and hard-of-hearing student for all aspects 
of life throughout continuum of high quality individualized 
educational and extracurricular programs and is an active 
partner in resource for the community. The school is committed 
to ensuring that each and every student is capable of achieving 
his or her maximum potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Mr. Simpson">ARC funds in the amount of $25,000, along with a $25,000 
match from the Margaret Briggs Foundation, were used to 
purchase smart panels, specialized lighting, computers, a 
drone, and editing software that allows deaf and hard-of-
hearing children to improve their skills using technology, 
expressive communication skills using American sign language, 
sign-supported English, and spoken English. This technology 
also allows the students to virtually interact with the student 
body at the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf as well as 
a small subset of deaf and hard-of-hearing students from other 
countries, including Sri Lanka and Ireland. This type of 
virtual connectivity allows the students to learn in a fun and 
interactive way and to see that there are children all around 
the globe who are deaf and hard-of-hearing just like them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Another example of how ARC funds has impacted the residents 
of Appalachia is located in Sullivan County, Pennsylvania. The 
Sullivan County Dental Clinic provides services to low-income 
patients. A 2010 assessment found that 33 percent of local 
adults had claimed that they had never had their teeth cleaned 
while regional pediatric oral surgeon characterized the area as 
the epicenter of tooth decay in Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Chairman Simpson, as a second-generation dentist, you 
surely can appreciate the importance of good oral hygiene and 
the need for accessible and affordable dental care. An ARC 
grant in the amount of $150,000 coupled with the mandatory 
matching funds will support the expansion and renovation of the 
Sullivan County Dental Clinic. This designated health 
professional shortage area will be renovated to allow low-
income patients access to critical dental services in a private 
and spacious environment as to the current overly crowded and 
open one that they have now. The modifications to the dental 
clinic will help to lower the barriers to dental care, 
improving health conditions for patients and the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And lastly, I would like to share with you a project out of 
Congressman Fleischmann's State, Tennessee. In 2014, in 
partnership with my State counterpart office, the Tennessee 
Department of Economic and Community Development, ARC invested 
$300,000 to the Appalachian Service Project in Johnson City, 
Tennessee to help build homes for low-income homeowners living 
in some of the State's most economically distressed areas. This 
project included veterans and their families. In the first 2 
years of the project, 16 homes were completed, several of which 
were specifically for veterans. In many cases, these homes 
replaced substandard, unsafe, and inefficient housing units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In addition to financing the builds, ARC dollars helped 
local partners provide additional supportive services, such as 
financial counseling, reduced cost childcare and job training. 
As President Walter Crouch of the ASP said, when we talk about 
the veterans housing issue, a lot of people think we are 
talking about vets who may be living under bridges and that 
sort of thing, but what they do not realize is many vets and 
their families live in substandard housing or mobile units that 
need a lot of repair. Without support from the ARC, I think it 
goes without saying that these projects would not have come to 
fruition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Mr. Simpson">As I close, I would ask every member of the subcommittee to 
take a long hard look at the work of the ARC and its supporting 
partners, such as our Local Development Districts. The work 
that the ARC has done since 1965 has transformed communities 
into vibrant epicenters, pardon me, and has enriched the lives 
of our brothers and sisters in ways that you may not imagine. 
Between October 2015 and January 2017, the ARC has invested 
$175.5 million in a total of 662 projects. The ARC funds have 
been matched by more than $257.4 million and will attract an 
additional $443.3 million in leveraged private investments in 
Appalachia, creating 23,670 jobs and educating over 49,000 
students and workers in the region. While the 13 States that 
embody Appalachia have made great progress, there is still 
plenty of work to do to advance the region. Your continued 
financial support of this program is critical and necessary for 
the citizens and businesses of Appalachia. Thank you.</paragraph>

SANDY DUNAHOO, COMMISSIONER FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Dunahoo. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of 
the committee. It is a pleasure to be here today. I am 
commissioner for the Department for Local Government in the 
Governor's Office in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I 
respectfully come before your committee today with over 30 
years of government public service and private consulting in 
the Appalachian region. I have been involved in hundreds of 
millions of dollars of projects created and developed for the 
sole purpose of improving the standard and substandard living 
conditions of the people of Appalachia. Today, I am here to 
share with you a personal story on a personal level regarding 
the work of the Appalachian Regional Commission and the impact 
that it has had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Mr. Simpson">My father was born in Owsley County, Kentucky, at the turn 
of the century and he was one of 12 brothers and sisters. They 
lived in a four-room house. They sustained their family by farm 
products. They worked in the fields, they raised pigs, they 
grew crops, and the family lived by selling these products to 
friends and neighbors. There were no opportunities for them to 
earn a wage because there were very few jobs available. 
Educational opportunities were very difficult. No one in his 
family attained an education higher than the eighth grade. So 
eventually, they left Kentucky; they left their home. They went 
to places like Connersville, Indiana; Dighton, Ohio; 
Indianapolis; different communities north to seek jobs, seek 
employment. So eventually, 10 of his siblings left Kentucky. As 
they left to seek their fortune, they never forgot home and 
they always had a yearning to come back. But again, it was so 
difficult; there were no opportunities and they just could not 
do that. But they prospered and they did well, and they were 
hardworking and they were commonsense people, and they attained 
amazingly high levels of wealth just through their hard work, 
commitment, and dedication. Fine folks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Today, I manage the family property, the same property 
where my father was born and his siblings grew up. And it is a 
different world today for me and for my young son, and the 
reason for that is the Appalachian Regional Commission. There 
are opportunities available to us today that my family would 
have never dreamed about years ago. We have access to county-
wide broadband internet; we have clean water, running water in 
our home, city water; we have access to city sewer--it is a few 
miles away, but it is possible to get it there; and the 
children in the community now have opportunities that were 
never available to them before. Some have become lawyers, 
doctors, pharmacists; they move on to levels of higher 
education; they have computers in the school, all because of 
the Appalachian Regional Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Mr. Simpson">While this sounds wonderful--and it is; it is an incredible 
transformation from where we were when my father lived in 
Kentucky--we are far from being finished with this work. The 
work of the Appalachian Regional Commission still remains. At 
the beginning of the ARC, we had 214 distressed counties in the 
commission. Today, we have 84. Thirty-eight of the 84 are still 
in Kentucky. We are in the heart of Appalachia and we have the 
most distressed counties in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Mr. Simpson">So what we are doing in our State is taking an aggressive 
effort to try to rectify this situation. We are doing 
everything we can to steward and marshal our resources wisely 
so that we can look toward funding the needs that we have 
within our State. We are looking at the mirror and we are 
taking a hard look at ourselves, and we are determining what is 
our future path going to be, and how are we going to get there, 
and how are going to raise our counties up from the distressed 
status, and we are making progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We are cutting red tape, we are reducing the burden on 
small businesses, we are incentivizing economic development, 
and we are having--beginning to realize growth in the very same 
areas that have been struck by poverty for years. We are, 
again, asking the tough questions, making the tough decisions. 
Sometimes they are not so popular, but we are on the right path 
and we are beginning to realize results in an area that has 
been chronically distressed for years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Many people misunderstand the people of Appalachia, the 
strength, the resiliency, the ability to sustain, the ability 
to live with little, but they also misunderstand the value in 
people such as these. We have an incredible work ethic. Our 
people truly are only asking for an opportunity to succeed. So 
my story to you today is, while we have made great strides with 
the Appalachian Regional Commission since the early 1960s, the 
work is far from done, but we are working toward a path that 
someday we hope we can move the rest of these 84 counties to 
sustainability as we have the counties that have been able to 
attain before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We would like to thank each of you for your support of the 
ARC in the past and we would like to thank publicly Congressman 
Rogers for his support of the ARC, particularly since most of 
these counties are in his region. And most of all, I would like 
to thank you for listening to our story in Kentucky today and 
hope that we can trust you to help us move forward. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you, Sandy, and before if you guys 
would stick around for just a minute, I want to get in the 
testimony of Amy from the Delta Regional Commission and then we 
can ask some questions so go ahead Amy.</paragraph>

AMY FECHER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS, ARKANSAS ECONOMIC</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Fecher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ranking member. My 
name is Amy Fecher and I represent the State of Arkansas and 
Governor Asa Hutchinson as his Designee to the Delta Regional 
Authority Board of Governors. I am here today to provide my 
testimony emphasizing the importance of the Delta Regional 
Authority and the continued need for investments that it 
provides in the Delta region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Mr. Simpson">The Delta Regional Authority is an independent federal 
agency created in Congress in 2000 that serves 252 parishes and 
counties in an eight state region. DRA operates as a federal 
state partnership and works with the governors to improve 
economic outcomes and enhance the quality of life for the 
regions 10 million residents. DRA makes strategic investments 
into basic public infrastructure, transportation 
infrastructure, work force training and education and business 
development with an emphasis on the entrepreneurship to advance 
economic and community development in the region. The lower 
Mississippi River region though rich in natural and human 
resources lags behind the rest of the U.S. in economic growth 
and prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Mr. Simpson">In FY 2016, 234 of the 252 counties and parishes within the 
region were deemed economically distressed. 21 percent of the 
region lives in poverty and only 20 percent of the Delta's 
population has a bachelor's degree or higher putting our 
regions workers at a disadvantage completely with the rest of 
the nation. I believe DRA can serve as a valuable tool to carry 
out the goals of President Trump and Congress to strengthen our 
nation's infrastructure and economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Mr. Simpson">DRA receives the majority of its appropriations from this 
subcommittee. Since FY 2002 DRA has invested approximately $163 
million into basic public infrastructure and transportation 
improvements, workforce training and education as well as 
business development projects. These investments have helped 
leverage 3.5 billion in other public and private funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Mr. Simpson">As an independent agency operating as a federal state 
partnership, DRA works closely with each of the eight governors 
and their designees to invest in economic and community 
development projects supporting the needs of their respective 
states. DRA aligns investments with each state's economic 
development goals and per Congressional mandate DRA must invest 
50 percent of its appropriation into basic public 
infrastructure and transportation infrastructure as well as 75 
percent of our allotment in economically distressed areas. The 
infrastructure projects include water and sewer improvements, 
road infrastructure and small inland port maintenance and 
expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Mr. Simpson">One example in my home state in Helena, Arkansas where DRA 
wrong with public and private partners repaired a damaged, 
closed rail line servicing the Helena Harbor. As of this week 
this port is open again and servicing 40 cars per day. This 
investment immediately saved jobs and has since seen expansion 
from the private sector. One CEO made the statement the rail 
was the critical factor in us locating in Helena, Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Much of DRA's foot print is comprised primarily of small, 
rural communities. Often Delta stakeholders voice their 
concerns regarding the difficulty of navigating federal 
resources from DRA's larger counterparts and do not have the 
capacity to develop and fund projects on their own. DRA 
addressees these concerns by investing in and supporting our 
most rural communities. From 2010 through 2016 59 percent of 
DRA's funds were invested into communities with a population of 
10,000 or less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Mr. Simpson">One of the benefits of DRA is its ability to move quickly 
to assist the needs of the Delta communities and the private 
industry. With a rolling application timeline DRA has helped 
Arkansas as well as other Delta states successfully close deals 
that create jobs and grow our states economies. DRA's 
flexibility to help us ensure necessary public safety in the 
aftermath and recovery of natural disasters. Recently DRA made 
an emergency investment last month in Higginson, Arkansas. A 
small rural community of 600 people was hit by a tornado and 
suffered major damage to their sewer plant. DRA provided 
$23,000 to assist with the restoration for these facilities. 
Lastly I would like to emphasize the importance of the Delta 
Leadership Institute. This unique program which I had the honor 
to graduate from in 2013 is training the types of community 
leaders that are running our region's communities often as a 
part-time job with very few resources. DLI is growing the 
knowledge, skill set and dynamic network of leaders that our 
communities and region need to compete in the U.S. as well as 
globally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Mr. Simpson">I can personally attest that going through this program has 
helped me in my role at the Arkansas Economic Development 
Commission. I hope the information I have provided today speaks 
to the overwhelming value of the DRA investments throughout the 
Delta region. DRA's primary goal is to help bring economic 
prosperity to one of the most distressed areas in the country 
and it is a successful model of public-private partnerships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony and 
I urge you to continue funding DRA so that it can continue to 
make strategic investments in infrastructure, businesses, and 
families in the Delta region. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Mr. Simpson">[The information follows:]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. Thank you for being here. If you guys would 
like to jump up to the table again, if you could because I am 
sure we will have a question. And go ahead and stay there. Pull 
up another chair because I do want to talk about these for just 
a second, if you could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And I do not want you to take this as a criticism or 
anything else. I know what you do is important work. In this 
bill, I guess in the Omnibus that we are going to be voting on 
in just a few minutes, or at least the rule for it, there is 
also the Denali Regional Commission, $15 million; $25 million 
for the Delta Regional Commission; 152 million for the 
Appalachian Regional Commission or Association, whatever it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And I understand both the need and why we are doing this or 
why it has been started. And I know why--you do not have to be 
a brain surgeon to figure out why they have been going on. 
Hobson tried to get rid of these for a number of years when I 
was first on this committee when he was the chairman of the 
committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Mr. Simpson">All of the circumstances you just described exist 
throughout this country. You go to Great Lakes and the loss of 
the manufacturing jobs up there. Go to Detroit and look at the 
unemployment. Look at the problems that exist there. You go to 
the Intermountain West, those problems exist there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And I am not suggesting that we eliminate these things. 
What I am suggesting is that somehow there needs to be some 
equity across this country. There is no Intermountain Regional 
Commission. There is no Great Lakes Regional Commission. There 
is no Heartland of America Regional Commission. And all of the 
problems that you describe do exist throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Mr. Simpson">When you talk about a dental clinic, I can take you to the 
need for dentistry throughout Idaho. Have you ever been on an 
Indian Reservation? Ethnic population with the highest rate of 
cavities around and no access, in many cases, to dentists. 
These things exist everywhere. Why should we fund these and 
nothing else?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Anybody care to----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Dunahoo. I would love to answer and I know time is of 
the essence, so we could certainly provide a written statement 
with further information. But I can give you a little bit of 
information and let you know that I have been in my position 
for a year and a half now. And coming new into my position I 
asked many of those same questions even though I had utilized 
the program for years, particularly in Kentucky when we look at 
the dollar amount of the investment that has gone into the 
Appalachian region and why have we not seen more benefit than 
we have?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And then the next question became are we truly lower than 
the rest of the Nation? So I began looking at income levels, 
per capita income. And we are indeed below the rest of the 
Nation in our 38 stressed counties that I mentioned earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Mr. Simpson">We have had a downturn in the economy, but in our office we 
also manage Coal Severance and the Coal Program. And I can tell 
you in the year that coal was the greatest in severance dollars 
received by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, we received $313 
million in severance dollars, that our counties were still the 
poorest in the Nation. So that is a systematic problem. And the 
loss of one industry, while it was traumatic, very traumatic to 
our people, we cannot even hope to be as good as we were in the 
good old days because we were still the poorest in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Mr. Simpson">So when we have a situation such as that and then we 
immediately begin to wean the program, the effects are 
devastating. So what we need is to have some time to work 
through, as I said in my statement, to look in the mirror, 
figure out what we can do, find ways to move forward to develop 
our region. We have had great success in the last year and a 
half. We still obviously have a way to go and that is what we 
need to be able to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. Well, and I appreciate that. I mean, as I 
said, I am not trying to criticize anything. I am also 
cognizant of the fact that I have been around for a while and I 
have seen how government programs work. And when you talk about 
ending the need for a program, that is a fantasy. That never 
ends. It goes on and it will go on and you will find new needs 
for it. It is just human nature. It is what we do. It is what I 
do in Idaho, you know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Mr. Simpson">But I find it kind of fascinating how we kind of select 
areas and decide that we are going to--and it is because of the 
congressmen at the time or the senators at the time that 
establish this. I mean, I have got to tell you, in all honesty, 
the reason that Chairman Hobson used to try to get rid of them 
because he wanted to get rid of the Denali Commission and 
Senator Stevens was chairman of the full Appropriations in the 
Senate and he just wanted to kind of stick him in the side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Mr. Simpson">He did not want to get rid of it, but that was--but, you 
know, I came across last year within the Department of Energy 
where at energy sites across the country they can charge what 
are called PILT payments, payment in lieu of taxes, for the 
energy sites. And it is voluntary between the local energy 
department and that site. And in some areas, communities are 
making pretty good money on PILT payments and in others they 
are not even being paid. And I told them this year we are 
either going to do it uniformly or we are not going to do it at 
all because it needs to be fairer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And that is kind of what I am looking at here. How do you 
address those same needs that you have and the rest of the 
country, and maybe it is through something like this. Maybe it 
is through something like this nationally, I do not know. But 
it is a discussion that we all ought to have because I will 
tell you that these programs are in danger, I think. In 
reducing times, budgets being reduced in the future, I can see 
the pressure to unfund these programs, essentially take the 
savings out of that. And so we better have a justification for 
them. And you better be able to make that justification to 
Marcy's constituents and to my constituents and the rest of 
this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Mr. Simpson">That is really all I----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="659" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our chairman is 
someone that one can work with on every issue, but I hear what 
he is saying. And I want to thank you, also, for your 
compelling testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="660" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And as women, I would say, also, you are dealing with some 
of the most intractable issues in terms of economic change. I 
was very impressed, Ms. Collins, with some numbers you provided 
for the region. Appalachia, I mean, just think about this, 
since 2000 has lost, counting manufacturing jobs and coal jobs, 
over 655,000 jobs. Six hundred and fifty-five thousand jobs. 
That is a neutron bomb over a region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="661" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And I will tell you, we have a struggle here, and the 
chairman puts his finger on it, you know, for regional equity 
and so forth with community adjustment when these massive job 
losses occur. I complained about--I am from northern Ohio, but 
we have Appalachia in southern Ohio, and just to walk through 
some of those communities and to see what they are enduring, 
most people in this Capitol will never get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="662" speaker="Mr. Simpson">I just saw the movie ``Hacksaw Ridge'', and I think Desmond 
Doss, he came from Lynchburg, Virginia. And though that is not 
directly in, you know, the states in which you live, I thought 
that is the spirit you were talking about. America really does 
not understand that sometimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="663" speaker="Mr. Simpson">And so we do not have a flexible system to target. We do 
not have any program really that deals with this kind of 
economic transformation. I saw where a solar company is going 
to be investing now in I do not know if it is Kentucky or West 
Virginia, I read, for coal adjustment and moving from a coal 
community to a major solar investment. I thought, yeah, okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="664" speaker="Mr. Simpson">But we saw them up in auto and steel country. As I sit here 
and listen to you, one of my communities is undergoing hundreds 
and hundreds and hundreds of job terminations because of dumped 
Korean steel and Chinese steel, and we cannot stop it. And it 
is not that the workers there did not try their mightiest, but 
we cannot get the government of the United States to respond 
fast enough to what is occurring there. You know, there will be 
a 2- or 3-year trade proceeding and it will eventually find 
that, yes, in fact, these people were hurt. But by then, they 
are devastated, their communities are devastated, and we do not 
have quickly flexible response mechanisms for economic 
readjustment in many of these places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="665" speaker="Mr. Simpson">So I guess I would say, Mr. Chairman, in answer to your 
plea, maybe they are representing some of the first ways 
America tried to deal with economic adjustment, but we do not 
have a very good solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="666" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. Well, as I said, Marcy, and I agree with your 
comments, it is a tough--and we are voting right now, by the 
way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="667" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Kaptur. Are we? Oh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="668" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. But it is a difficult issue because I will 
tell you that the lost coal mining jobs in Appalachia region is 
no different than the lost timber jobs in Idaho, and they have 
gone down to where, in my district, we do not have any sawmills 
left. Hell, I am from Idaho, you know. In the other district 
there is not very many sawmills left and there used to be 
sawmills throughout the towns. That was their economic 
development was a sawmill. So the same thing happens in places 
and we have got to find a better way to do it than competing 
against one another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="669" speaker="Mr. Simpson">But let me tell you, I do appreciate what you do. It is 
necessary and we will continue to work with you, but we need to 
have a broader discussion on how to deal with this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="670" speaker="Mr. Simpson">So thank you all for being here and thank you for 
testifying today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="671" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Dunahoo. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="672" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Mr.  Simpson. You bet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Mr. Simpson">Ms.  Dunahoo. Thank you both.</paragraph>
