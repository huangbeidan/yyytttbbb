Administration for today's Committee meeting. A quorum is 
present, so we may proceed. The meeting record will remain open 
for 5 legislative days so that Members may submit any materials 
that they wish to be included therein.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="">There are three items that we have on the docket today: 
First, Committee Resolution 115-6, the Committee's views and 
estimates on the fiscal year 2019; second, we have Committee 
Resolution 115-7, a measure to amend the regulations 
collectively known as the Members' Congressional Handbook; and, 
third, Committee Resolution 115-8, a measure to amend the 
regulations collectively known as the Committee Congressional 
Handbook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="">The first item before us is Committee Resolution 115-6, the 
Committee's views and estimates for fiscal year 2019. The 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires Congressional 
Committees to submit to the Committee on the Budget their views 
and estimates on programs within their jurisdictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="">The views and estimates we are making up today highlight 
the Committee's continued work to conduct oversight and 
identify future potential savings at the Federal Election 
Commission. As the Committee has stated previously, one way to 
reduce the FEC's budget is to eliminate the Presidential 
Election Campaign Fund. The Committee continues that 
recommendation. In addition, the views and estimates highlight 
the ongoing concerns the Committee has with the Election 
Assistance Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="">The views and estimates reflect the Committee's support for 
the ongoing efforts to strengthen the cybersecurity platforms 
within each of the legislative branch entities and agencies. 
Equally important, the Committee supports the ongoing efforts 
in the House to ensure it has the resources and assistance in 
the event of a cyber attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="">Furthermore, the views and estimates recognize the 
importance of providing resources to address the issue of 
sexual harassment. As I have said previously, one case of 
sexual harassment is one too many. We need to ensure that the 
House's training program, which will begin this April, is 
effective in educating and preventing discrimination and 
harassment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="">Finally, the views and estimates recognize the ongoing need 
to secure and protect Members, their staffs, their 
constituents, and, of course, the public. The events in the 
summer of 2017 and the corresponding increase in threats 
against Members demonstrate security remains paramount. The 
Committee supports funding for the United States Capitol Police 
and the House Sergeant at Arms for these efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="">The second measure before us, Committee Resolution 115-7, 
clarifies certain provisions and makes additional technical 
corrections to the Members' Congressional Handbook, and I will 
mention a few. First, the Committee Resolution incorporates the 
prohibitions contained in H. Res. 724, which we passed earlier 
this month. H. Res. 724, among other things, prohibits the 
Members' representational allowance from being used for 
settlements or for an award in connection with conduct 
prohibited by the Congressional Accountability Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="">The Committee resolution also clarifies the use of the MRA 
for security, including allowing prior year funds to be 
obligated for security furnishings and enhancements, clarifies 
the role of the House Sergeant at Arms in approving noncapital 
security enhancements; clarifies responsibility for costs 
associated with security enhancements considered capital 
improvements; clarifies payments for security personnel are an 
ordinary and reimbursable expense; and, lastly, clarifies 
security items exceeding $500 must be added to office 
inventory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="">Finally, the third measure on our docket, Committee 
Resolution 115-8, mirrors the changes in the Members' 
Congressional Handbook as it relates to settlements and awards 
under the Congressional Accountability Act. The measure 
prohibits Committee funding from being used for settlements or 
awards in connection with conduct prohibited by the 
Congressional Accountability Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="">    I would now like to recognize my colleague and the 
Committee's Ranking Member, Mr. Brady, for the purpose of 
providing an opening statement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Brady</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Brady">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this
business meeting today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Brady">I support the three Committee resolutions before us. 
However, we do intend to file minority views on the proposed 
views and estimates on the President's budget, as we do have 
some well-known disagreements about the Election Assistance 
Commission and the Federal Election Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Brady">    And, of course, we support the ban on using the MRA or 
Committee funds to settle sexual harassments and discrimination 
cases. That is a very long overdue commonsense change, and I 
appreciate your bipartisan work on that. I encourage my 
colleagues to support the proposal before us, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
