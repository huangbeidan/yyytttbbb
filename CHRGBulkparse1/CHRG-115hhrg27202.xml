                           Committee on Financial Services,
                                                   Washington, D.C.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in 
room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Sean P. Duffy 
[chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.
    Members present: Representatives Duffy, Ross, Royce, 
Pearce, Posey, Luetkemeyer, Stivers, Hultgren, Rothfus, Zeldin, 
Trott, MacArthur, Budd; Cleaver, Velazquez, Capuano, Sherman, 
Beatty, Kildee, and Kihuen.
    Ex officio present: Representatives Hensarling and Waters.
    Also present: Representatives Kustoff and Green.
    Chairman Duffy. The Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance 
will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized 
to declare a recess of the subcommittee at any time.
    Also, without objection, members of the full Financial 
Services Committee who are not members of this subcommittee may 
participate in today's hearing for the purposes of making an 
opening statement and questioning our witness.
    Today's hearing is entitled, ``Flood Insurance Reform: 
FEMA's Perspective.''
    The Chair now recognizes himself for 3 minutes for an 
opening statement. As I said at our first hearing last month, 
this subcommittee has a full agenda this year. Our top priority 
is a timely reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance 
Program (NFIP) and its key authorities, which are set to expire 
on September 30th.
    Over the past few weeks, my staff and I have taken over 50 
meetings with stakeholders on top of the multiple meetings that 
were taken by Chairman Luetkemeyer in the last Congress.
    On Monday, I had the opportunity to visit Louisiana with 
Majority Whip Steve Scalise, where I visited local parish 
leaders, levee district representatives, bankers, retailers, 
homebuilders, and many others. I also toured the southern part 
of the State which was devastated, as we know, by Hurricane 
Katrina, in which 1,800 people lost their lives.
    The NFIP is critical to many Americans. Over and over 
again, some of the same things continue to emerge in the 
meetings that I hold.
    First, a lapse in the program would be irresponsible and 
would be damaging to communities.
    Second, policies must be accessible and affordable for 
those who are in need.
    Third, there is a strong interest in the growth of a robust 
private market that can offer consumers a choice in flood 
insurance.
    Fourth, communities are frustrated by the accuracy of 
FEMA's flood maps and the amount of time it takes for maps to 
be approved.
    Fifth, we should explore new options for mitigation and 
community resiliency.
    Sixth, the financial integrity of the program is weak. 
Today, the NFIP is more than $24.6 billion in debt and runs an 
annual deficit of $1.5 billion. This is absolutely 
unsustainable.
    And finally, we must address some of the egregious claims 
processing problems that the northeast in particular 
experienced during Superstorm Sandy.
    I am grateful to Mr. MacArthur, Mr. King, Mr. Zeldin, and 
Ms. Velazquez for the input they have given us as we have gone 
through this process, input on behalf of their constituents.
    So I look forward to a robust discussion with Mr. Wright 
this morning about FEMA's perspective on these issues and 
others as we ready legislation for reauthorization of this 
program, which is so important to millions of Americans.
    I now recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, the 
gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you, Mr. Wright, for being here today. Over the 
past few years, this subcommittee has held a number of hearings 
to assess the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and to 
discuss the program's reauthorization. And as we all know, 
authorization for the program will expire on September 30, 
2017.
    Should the program expire without reauthorization, no new 
flood insurance contracts will be able to be extended, which 
means that homebuyers will not be able to obtain mortgages and 
close on their homes in flood hazard areas.
    Additionally, the NFIP's ability to borrow from the 
Treasury will be drastically reduced. Given the importance of 
the NFIP to our constituents, it is absolutely critical that 
this committee work together to reauthorize the program before 
the September deadline.
    The NFIP was created in 1968 to provide flood coverage to 
consumers who were unable to obtain coverage from the limited 
private market. The NFIP is funded primarily through premiums 
and fees from policyholders, and a portion of the premiums is 
used to fund mapping and mitigation activities.
    Currently, the program covers about 5 million homes 
nationwide for a total of $1 trillion in flood insurance 
coverage. It is important to reiterate that the threat of 
flooding impacts all of our communities, from coastal regions 
in Florida to parts of Texas and New York, and even to my own 
State of Missouri. There are over 200,000 Missourians who live 
in areas where flooding is a risk.
    As options for reauthorization are discussed, we need to 
work to ensure that flood insurance remains affordable to our 
constituents. And to this end, it is essential that FEMA 
completes the affordable framework that was mandated by the 
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act.
    Additionally, it is important for us to continue exploring 
the best methods for keeping our flood maps updated and to 
provide sufficient funding for the process. Mitigation is key 
to preventing flood damage, and I am eager to further assess 
how best to improve those efforts.
    Lastly, as we move forward in this legislative process we 
need to assess the current role of the private market and the 
role that it plays in our future.
    Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield to the ranking member of 
the full Financial Services Committee, Ms. Waters.
    Ms. Waters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Reauthorization of the 
National Flood Insurance Program is critical. Our housing 
market has struggled in the past as Congress continued to 
extend the NFIP for months at a time.
    These short-term extensions sometimes led to lapses in the 
program's authorization, which caused instability, wreaked 
havoc on our housing market, and placed communities at risk.
    That is why I worked with Mrs. Biggert on what ultimately 
became the Biggert-Waters Act, to put forth a bipartisan, long-
term reauthorization. We accomplished a lot of good things in 
the Biggert-Waters Act, but what I will never forget are the 
unintended consequences of the rate increases that caused great 
concern for homeowners, businesses, and renters across the 
country.
    In response, I worked tirelessly with my colleagues across 
the aisle to enact much-needed rate relief for thousands of 
homeowners and put FEMA back on the path to addressing 
affordability issues. Let's continue in that bipartisan spirit 
to ensure that the NFIP remains able to provide affordable 
flood insurance.
    The affordability challenges are great, but the risk of 
failing to protect homes and businesses in the face of 
catastrophe is greater. Congress must address the $24.6 billion 
debt the program has accumulated responding to catastrophic 
storms like Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy.
    I will continue to call for the cancellation of this 
enormous burden that has already cost the NFIP nearly $4 
billion in interest alone.
    Mr. Chairman, as we move forward, we should remember that 
in the past 5 years, Congress has made sweeping reforms to 
nearly every aspect of the flood insurance process. In our 
efforts to quickly move a reauthorization, let us not repeat 
the mistakes of the past, when we may have acted with good 
intentions, but due to unintended consequences ended up with 
bad outcomes for families and businesses.
    I yield back the balance of my time.
    Chairman Duffy. The gentlelady yields back.
    The Chair now recognizes the vice chairman of the 
subcommittee, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Ross, who has 
done a lot of work on flood insurance both on this committee, 
and in his prior life in the legislature in Florida. The 
gentleman is recognized for 2 minutes.
    Mr. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank our 
distinguished guest, Mr. Roy Wright, for being here to discuss 
FEMA's perspective on flood insurance reform. The NFIP is 
something that we have a responsibility to reauthorize in a 
very brief period of time, as was pointed out by my colleagues.
    The fact is the NFIP is in need of significant reforms. 
Floods are a costly and deadly peril, and as has been pointed 
out, the NFIP has an outstanding debt of $24.6 billion. We must 
thoroughly consider reforms to protect taxpayers and improve 
the program now and for the future.
    Ultimately, when I consider reforms to the NFIP, I do so 
with my Florida homeowners in mind. I am committed to ensuring 
that Florida homeowners have uninterrupted access to affordable 
and comprehensive flood insurance policies. As such, my 
priorities for reauthorizing the NFIP are as follows.
    First, Floridians and all Americans across the country 
would greatly benefit from more choices when it comes to flood 
insurance policies, and private competition in this market will 
lead to greater innovation and more affordable and 
comprehensive policies for consumers. We must enact reforms 
that remove regulatory barriers and allow for the development 
of a private flood insurance market.
    Yesterday, I reintroduced my bipartisan legislation that 
passed the House last session by a vote of 419-0. This bill 
will do just that with regard to competition and consumer 
choice.
    Second, we must place the NFIP on sound fiscal footing and 
ensure that there is no lapse in authorization of the program 
that would create an interruption to the real estate markets.
    Third, we must recognize the importance of mitigation and 
reducing the risk exposures for floods and other disasters. Our 
witness today has testified that for every $1 investment in 
mitigation, communities see a savings of $4 in disaster relief. 
The importance of mitigation cannot be understated or 
overlooked.
    I look forward to working with my colleagues to address 
these and other important issues related to the reauthorization 
and reform of the NFIP.
    I thank the chairman again for calling this hearing, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
    Chairman Duffy. The gentleman yields back the balance of 
his time.
    We now welcome our witness, Mr. Roy Wright, who serves as 
FEMA's Deputy Associate Administrator for the Federal Insurance 
and Mitigation Administration. In that capacity, Mr. Wright 
directs the National Flood Insurance Program, the Mitigation 
and Resiliency programs under FEMA's Stafford Act authorities, 
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program, and the 
National Dam Safety Program.
    Mr. Wright will now be recognized for 5 minutes to give an 
oral presentation of his testimony. And without objection, his 
written statement will be made a part of the record.
    Once the witness has finished presenting his testimony, 
each member of the subcommittee will be given 5 minutes within 
which to ask questions.
    On your table, as you know, Mr. Wright, you have three 
lights: green means go; yellow means you have a minute left; 
and red means your time is up.
    With that, Mr. Wright, you are now recognized for 5 
minutes.

    <opening>STATEMENT OF ROY E. WRIGHT, DEPUTY ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR,</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="ROY E. WRIGHT">   FEDERAL INSURANCE AND MITIGATION ADMINISTRATION, FEDERAL 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA), U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Wright">Good morning, Chairman Duffy, Chairman
Hensarling, Ranking Member Cleaver, Ranking Member Waters, and 
other members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Wright">I want to discuss four core principles for reauthorization 
with you this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Wright">First, we need an on-time multiyear reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Wright">Second, we need to increase flood insurance coverage across 
the Nation through both the expansion of private flood 
insurance markets as well as the National Flood Insurance 
Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Wright">Third, we need to address barriers to meeting the needs and 
demands of our customers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Wright">And fourth, we need to bring transparency to the financial 
framework of the National Flood Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Wright">Flooding is the most frequent and expensive disaster in the 
United States: 90 percent of natural disasters in the United 
States involve a flood, and 22,235 communities across the 
Nation rely on the National Flood Insurance Program. That 
represents 98 percent of the Nation's population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Wright">We work with 73 private insurance companies who participate 
with FEMA in delivering these policies to our 5.1 million 
policyholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Wright">So let's look with some perspective over the last couple of 
decades. Due to the nature of flooding, impacts can vary 
significantly each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Wright">After 15 years of lower-than-expected damages, Hurricanes 
Katrina, Rita, and Wilma all hit the Nation in 2005. These 3 
catastrophic events resulted in NFIP claims that totaled 8 
times the size of any prior year in the program's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Wright">Rather than directly providing the funds to meet these 
requirements, Congress directed the NFIP to pay for 
catastrophic losses through funds borrowed from the Treasury. 
Paying the insured losses in 2005 required the NFIP to borrow 
$17.5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Wright">In 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast and resulted in 
more than 144,000 NFIP claims. The program paid out an initial 
$8.4 billion to policyholders. With the corrective actions that 
FEMA has taken, the NFIP has since paid out an additional $350 
million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Wright">Since Hurricane Sandy, FEMA has been transforming the NFIP 
customer experience and has been improving our oversight and 
engagement with the Write Your Own (WYO) companies. Using our 
own authorities, we have implemented a new appeals process. We 
have improved the oversight of the Write Your Own companies, 
with special attention to litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Wright">FEMA has streamlined the process for making regular changes 
to the relationships with the private sector partners. And we 
have begun to modernize the product to better provide the 
coverages that policyholders want and expect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Wright">The NFIP is also going to change as being more proactive in 
disaster readiness and response. I think 2016 is a case in 
point. We began issuing advanced payments to policyholders, up 
to $10,000, while their full claim was processed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Wright">We increased coordination with State insurance 
commissioners. We deployed our insurance staff directly 
downrange in the field. And we have far more proactive 
communication with policyholders and the companies. I would 
assert that FEMA's performance in 2016 demonstrates the 
proactive progress we have made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Wright">While there was no single catastrophic disaster in 2016, 
multiple events in Louisiana, Texas, and several other States 
involved in Hurricane Matthew all resulted in the third largest 
claims payout in NFIP history, with incurred losses of more 
than $4 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Wright">So to the reauthorization, the core principles, first, it 
has been said by numerous people today, and I would wholly 
agree, that the NFIP needs an on-time, multiyear 
reauthorization. The stability of the real estate and mortgage 
markets depend on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Wright">Second, the reauthorization should recognize the need to 
increase flood insurance coverage across the Nation in both 
high- and moderate-risk areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Wright">FEMA recognizes that there is a growing interest by private 
insurers to offer flood insurance protection. FEMA supports 
this because an insured survivor, whether they get their 
coverages on the private market or through the NFIP, will 
recover more quickly and more fully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Wright">To these ends, we must realize that it will take time for 
the private market to adapt to the market currently served by a 
public program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Wright">And if the private market were to glean only the lower-risk 
policies, the NFIP would be left with all of the high-risk 
policies. This could lower NFIP premium revenue while 
increasing potential claims payout. Such action would leave the 
program with even more financial risk, with greater reliance on 
taxpayers and the Treasury each and every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Wright">As we look forward, a number of opportunities should be 
explored. Congress could identify a future point in time by 
which flood policies for all new construction would be provided 
solely by the private market. When coupled with ongoing 
floodplain management and building code enforcement, these new 
residential structures would be built to insurable levels for 
risk to the private market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Wright">Third, we need to remove barriers to providing 
policyholders the coverages they want and need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Wright">And finally, we will all be better off in the future 
discussions relating to the National Flood Insurance Program 
when the program has a sound financial framework.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Wright">We need to price the risk and make it plain. Whether this 
is done by increasing premiums, reducing risk through 
mitigation grants, or by discounts directed by Congress, the 
fiscal solvency of the program depends on it.</paragraph>

52 of the appendix.]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Chairman Duffy">Thank you, Mr. Wright.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The Chair now recognizes himself for 5 minutes to ask 
questions. Mr. Wright, my staff reached out to yours in regard 
to data on compliance rates for mandatory purchase properties. 
We have heard a lot of conversation, as I have talked to a lot 
of stakeholders, that there is a low take-up rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Chairman Duffy">You have indicated to me that you don't have data on that 
front. We have actually reached out to the OCC, who also said 
that they don't have data on that front.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Chairman Duffy">However, earlier this week our staff was provided a copy of 
the following slide--if we could put the slide up--from a FEMA-
developed presentation entitled, ``State of the NFIP,'' which 
says there is a significant amount of noncompliance--53 percent 
of policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    I would just note, being a guy from Wisconsin, we are one 
of the best of the worst States on that front. Duly noted. Do 
you stand by this data?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Wright"> So--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> My question is, I keep hearing this, and I
am wondering where this data is coming from? That is a real 
issue in regard to the program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Wright">There is a set of studies that have been out
there. We have cited them. As you look nationally, I have heard 
a third. We can look at the half in terms of these concentrated 
States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Wright">Under the National Flood Insurance Act, mandatory purchase 
is not a responsibility of the National Flood Insurance Program 
at FEMA. I can use the data that is there. What I will tell you 
is it is very difficult to fully understand a couple of pieces 
of the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Wright">I was shown some data 2 weeks ago that 39 percent of real 
estate transactions in 2016 were cash transactions. And so when 
we started looking at the way that would play, those folks 
would not be having a federally-backed mortgage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Wright">    That said, more people clearly need to be covered. There 
are structures at risk that do not have the insurance they 
need. And collectively, whether that is through us or through 
the lending regulators, we need to redouble our efforts to see 
that improve.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Just to be clear, this is a FEMA document,
correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> FEMA in the bottom left corner. Do you
stand by these numbers?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Wright"> They are the best--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Is it a surprise that this is a problem?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I acknowledge it as a problem and it is the
best numbers that I have available to me today, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Okay. Let's move on to the NFIP debt and
future costs. Under Grimm-Waters and Biggert-Waters, there is a 
requirement that FEMA put a plan together to pay back the 
billions of dollars the NFIP owes the American taxpayer. You 
are tasked in putting together a plan. Have you put together a 
plan to pay back the American taxpayer?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We have developed the required plans related to
when we borrow. To be very plain, given the discounts, later 
the subsidies and grandfathering that are in place today, there 
is not a practical way for us to repay this debt.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> So we don't have a plan to pay it back?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Based on the discounts and subsidies that I
have been directed under the National Flood Insurance Act to 
implement, which are the constraints--I have to follow the 
laws--I don't have an ability to do so.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Is it possible for you to put together a
plan that says okay, I am going to make a recommendation to 
Congress which states that if you want to pay this back, this 
is what you have to do on a policy front to actually allow me 
to be in a situation where this debt can be paid down or 
brought to zero?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Wright"> It would require an exponential move in the
policy premiums or reserve allocations in order for us to be 
able to pay the normal year claims, deal with the mid and 
larger events that are prospectively coming, and deal with the 
$24.6 billion. The $24.5 billion that is there I can attribute 
to the grandfathering and discounts that we have been directed 
to implement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Quickly, I want to move to reinsurance.
Obviously, we now have purchased reinsurance through the NFIP.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Are there any plans to have further
purchases of reinsurance to offload some of our risk?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Wright">Absolutely, and I have collaborated with a
number of people on the committee on this front. I think, 
rightfully, this committee pushed the program to begin to find 
other ways to transfer the debt. We did a pilot last fall and 
then did this first placement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I view it as a cornerstone placement that we will building 
upon going forward. Reinsurance is an important tool, but I do 
not believe that reinsurance can wholly solve for the unmanaged 
liabilities that are in front of us.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Chairman Duffy">I only have 15 seconds left, but I want to
go back to the slide that I presented to you. You said that you 
stand by these numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    Do you have any recommendations on what you should be 
doing, or regulators of banks should be doing, or what Congress 
should be doing to make sure? If you stand by these numbers, 
the take-up rate isn't as low as it actually is. It is at 50 
percent.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Wright">We need to collectively be working with the
insurance agents that are across the country who are the 
frontline salesforce that is there. We need to be working with 
the banking regulators, the lenders, OCC and others, who have 
those authorities in place. And collectively, we have to push 
farther down the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Wright">There were some increases in penalties that were put into 
the last bill that became law. Obviously, that has not forced 
us to see a bigger uptake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Where I see the uptake happen is when people in the 
aftermath of events, when they have seen their neighbors and 
others across their State experience flooding, that is the 
point by which I usually begin to see an increase in policies.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Chairman Duffy">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the 
subcommittee, the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">    Mr. Wright, I want to go back to where the chairman was on 
the debt, the $23 billion and coverage is about $1 trillion, a 
trillion dollars? If we wanted to realistically try to 
eliminate the debt, what percentage of an increase do you think 
would be required on the policy premiums?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Without fully being able to model out the exact
expected--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Cleaver"> No, I understand. I am just--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Wright">--losses that are there, but I finished 2016
having used up all of the reserve fund, which thankfully had 
been created. And we used up $1.5 billion out of the reserve 
fund. I drained all the premiums that were there and still 
needed another $1.6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Wright">That kind of event or year the models tell me I would 
expect in any 10-year period it would be reasonable to expect 
that. To pay off the debt seems impractical to me in that that 
debt is associated with discounts and subsidies that Congress 
asked me and my predecessors to implement, which we did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Wright">    The idea that we would then go to future policyholders and 
say they have to pay for that debt, I think becomes a difficult 
mountain to climb.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Cleaver"> Right. So we all acknowledge, I think, that we
have a significant debt. And what would be at risk if we just 
forgave the debt, just write it off and with this new bill 
coming out, hopefully before September 30th, we can begin a 
process of preventing another rise of $23 billion?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Wright">I think things like reinsurance help us build a
credibility so that we are less likely to experience those kind 
of losses going forward. Ultimately, only Congress can deal 
with that. It was under Congress' direction that we went and 
borrowed those dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Wright">From a year-to-year perspective the piece that has the most 
direct impact on us is the servicing of that debt. And while 
today we have an advantageous rate with the Treasury, it is 
nearly $400 million a year that we are paying to service that 
debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Wright">    In this instance, the interest payments that I owe, just 
under $200 million this month, we will be paying based off of 
money that we borrowed from the Treasury.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Cleaver"> But if we had WYOs, if more than--how many? We
have 70-something?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We have 73 Write Your Owns today.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Cleaver"> Okay. If that wasn't the program, that means
that the insurance companies would service the debt, would 
service the policies?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Wright"> So if this was written entirely in the private
market they would have to charge rates and submit to insurance 
regulators in their State. They would have to charge rates 
commensurate with that risk. And those rates in many instances 
would be substantially higher than we charge today.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Cleaver"> Okay. Now, does it make sense to have a bill
that we make--I realize we are legislative and you are not, but 
privately, I am asking for advice.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">Would it not be helpful if we had a 10- or 12-
year bill so that we could actually experiment with the WYO 
program, giving interested companies an opportunity to examine 
and look at this program perhaps better than they ever had or 
that we have had?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">    And that as the years move by we then reduce the Government 
participation until it reaches a level that won't bankrupt the 
Government?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Wright">Right. Two points on that, Mr. Cleaver. I think
in terms of the length of a reauthorization, I would leave that 
up to the committee. I think we need a multiyear and there are 
a lot of different ways to get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Wright">I do think that in terms of what does it mean over this 
next decade to see the private market grow, I am a strong 
proponent of seeing the private market grow. As I said in my 
testimony, I can imagine beginning to set aside portions, 
particularly new construction at a date on forward by which 
when we look at that it says that will solely be purchased on 
the private market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I think it give us an opportunity to create dedicated 
space, let those markets take hold, take root, and flourish. 
Because at the end of the day, from a public policy 
perspective, yes, I direct the National Flood Insurance 
Program, and I am an advocate for the National Flood Insurance 
Program, but more important is to ensure that people are 
covered for these risks. Because I know after an event, when I 
am on the ground, those who are insured recover more quickly 
and more fully.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Cleaver"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the vice chairman of the 
subcommittee, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Ross, for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Ross">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Ross">    And if I might go back to the slide that was up with the 
questioning by the Chair? Quickly, Mr. Wright, this is taken 
from a policy and mandatory purchase requirement penetration 
report ending in July 2014. Is there a more recent report, and 
if so can you provide the committee with that report?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Wright"> FEMA does not have a report it has generated.
There are a number of statements and reports that are out and 
we would be happy to--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Ross"> The most recent would be whatever resources that
are out there that would reflect similar data.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I would be happy to do so.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Ross"> Great. Quickly, in regard to reinsurance, how
much reinsurance would you say you purchased on behalf of NFIP 
in percent of your liability, your exposure--5 percent?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Wright">It depends on what the probable maximum loss is
in those kind of pieces and you would never insure all the way 
to that full probable maximum loss. But a 1 percent annual 
chance event across the entire program has been modeled at 
about $26 billion. We often view that as a probable maximum 
loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Wright">    So I would look at the revenues in any given year, retained 
premiums and the like. The 1 percent that we bought, the $1 
billion, excuse me, that we bought--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Ross"> So it is not a function of capacity in the
market, is it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Wright"> At some point, this does turn into a capacity
question.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Ross"> But there is significantly more capacity than 1
percent, I would assume?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Wright"> There is more capacity than we have used.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Ross">Good. And I apologize because I am going to kind
of go fast here in 5 minutes. Let's talk about risk assessment 
because I think that is what we really get at when we are 
talking about insurance, not relief but insurance where we have 
prefunding of risk and we manage that risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Ross">There is a 2014 NFIP report report on the feasibility of 
releasing property specific policy and claims data which states 
that, ``Full risk premiums--these are flood premiums--are not 
based on loss experience due to the large variability of flood 
losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Ross">``Rather, NFIP rate setting is based on several components 
that vary from property to property and involves complex 
calculations of expected frequency and severity of flood 
losses.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Ross">    So you would agree with that, I assume? And I guess my 
question is, you don't use loss claims data to assess risk, is 
that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I think--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Ross"> But anybody else out there who is managing risk
uses loss claims data.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We do use loss claims data.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Ross"> To what extent?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We use that along with other data. And so--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Ross"> And about that data, do you consider the data and
the calculations that the NFIP uses to assess their risk to be 
proprietary?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I do not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Ross"> So it could be shared?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Wright"> So--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Ross"> You are the only game in town essentially?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Wright"> What I have done is, as part of reinsurance, we
did a lot of modeling in order to get pricing from the 
reinsurers.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Ross"> Right. But--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Wright"> the result of that additional--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Ross"> --for pricing to the consumer.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Correct. So to that point, I have recently
released most of the data that I provided to the reinsurers. It 
is the fullest expression of loss that we have ever published.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Ross"> Okay. So you use some loss claim data for that,
but looking ahead, you also really just rely on mapping and 
elevations?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Wright"> No, I use loss claim data as well as future
expected losses.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Ross"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Wright"> There are other elements, but if I look at my
rate calculations, both of those elements come into that 
calculation.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Ross"> How granular do you get? Do you ever go to see if
this--do you concern yourselves with whether the structure you 
are considering insuring, which we will have to insure, is 
concrete block, wood, or whatever?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We do look at type of construction. We also
look at elevation of that structure and the expected--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Ross"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Wright"> In a coastal area, we look at velocity
elements, whether there has been ponding. We do look at those 
elements as well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Ross"> So when we talk about mitigation, what incentives
are out there for an existing homeowner to mitigate under the 
NFIP?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Wright"> The first incentive is that by mitigating, they
are going to be able to withstand that flooding event. Beyond 
that, I have used some ways to discount the flood insurance 
pricing if their community participates in the community rating 
system.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Ross"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Wright"> And in some instances, we make grants available
to do that elevation or acquire that property.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Ross"> And if I am a homeowner who believes they have
mitigated their home to withstand, and I have science and 
engineering to support that, how do I go about convincing you 
that I am entitled to a discount or otherwise am not the risk 
that you have assessed me at?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Chief among them is going to be the elevation
of that, and we have ways for you to submit those data to us, 
and we will look at that specific property.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Ross"> And if I am successful, having spent thousands of
dollars for my engineerings, I bear the cost of that, don't I? 
There is no recovery of costs for being able to be successful 
against the NFIP to have a reduction in premium?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Ross</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Ross">Is that correct? Okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Ross">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from New York for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Velazquez</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Ms. Velazquez">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Ms. Velazquez">Mr. Wright, President Trump has stated multiple times that 
Mexico will pay for his proposed border wall. But now, 
according to media reports released on March 7th by the 
Washington Post and this morning by another outlet, it is 
looking like the White House is considering a surcharge on NFIP 
policyholders to pay for the President's border wall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Ms. Velazquez">    So Mr. Wright, what do you have to say to homeowners who 
are trying to purchase insurance through NFIP and find it more 
expensive because of this new surcharge? And what do you say to 
taxpayers in this country, because throughout the campaign 
trail Mr. Trump said that Mexico will pay for that wall?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Wright">I am familiar with the report that you are
referencing. To the best of my knowledge, final decisions 
related to the budget being developed by the White House have 
not been made, so I need to refer you to the Office of 
Management and Budget related to those pre-decisional elements 
related to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Wright">    The assurance that I can give you, Congresswoman, is that 
when we do have a budget proposal in hand, I would be happy to 
sit down and discuss that with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Velazquez</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Ms. Velazquez">Well, I can tell you this. Policyholders in
my district in Red Hook, in lower Manhattan, who were 
devastated by Sandy, they truly, truly believe that this is an 
outrageous idea. And I hope that you can take that to the 
President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. Velazquez">Mr. Wright, in response to the systemic problems in the WYO 
program that surfaced after Sandy, I have introduced H.R. 1423, 
the National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization and 
Improvement Act of 2017, to improve the efficiency and 
transparency of the processing of claims and to provide better 
oversight and management of FEMA and the Write Your Owns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Ms. Velazquez">    What lessons has FEMA learned in the aftermath of Sandy? 
And how have you incorporated those lessons into your claim 
practices?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Wright">I appreciate the question. As we look at it,
clearly Sandy was a pivot point. The program had lost the focus 
on the policyholder and on the customer that needed to be 
there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Wright">    There are many things that we have learned, some of which 
change how we sell policies going forward. Let me take 
particularly the element related to claims and oversight 
because I think that is where you are headed with this.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Velazquez</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. Velazquez"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Wright">We have now issued instructions which ensure
that after an event, we go down and provide additional training 
to adjusters before they go out. We have increased the amount 
of quality control of those adjusters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Wright">    To the point of engineering reports, I have issued 
instructions, so there is policy out to all of the Write Your 
Owns--whatever engineering report is the basis of the claim 
decision must be provided to the policyholder. They have a 
right to see what those elements are.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Velazquez</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Ms. Velazquez"> Okay. Thank you. A number of the Sandy claim
disputes revolve around whether the flood caused the damage or 
the property had a pre-existing condition. Could you tell me 
what fraction of the properties in the NFIP currently have such 
a pre-existing condition that might lead to denial or reduction 
in a claim payment? And if not, what will FEMA need in order to 
estimate that figure?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Wright">I think that the nature of structures,
particularly residential structures, continues to evolve over 
time. And so I don't know if you can ever have a perfect 
insight into it. As we look at these elements, what I have 
tried to do is make plain--one of the things that we have given 
advice on to policyholders, and actually it is true for all 
kinds of insurance, is that you should be taking pictures and a 
video of your home every single year all the way around and 
walking all the way through. You will have physical 
documentation of what pre-existing looked like in these 
instances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Wright">    But we have to look at this. I sometimes use a car example 
related to insurance.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Velazquez</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Ms. Velazquez"> You are not of the opinion that you need to
go and inspect a property before buying a flood insurance 
policy?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Today, an agent works with them. There are data
that are collected. I don't know about the feasibility of 
visiting all 5.1 million policyholders.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Velazquez</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Ms. Velazquez">Okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Ms. Velazquez">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentlelady yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico for

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Pearce">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Pearce">    Mr. Wright, continuing the discussion that Mr. Ross had 
about the release of your data, are you allowed by law to 
release that data?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Wright"> The legal constraint that I have says that I
need to continue to comply with the Privacy Act when I do so. 
And I know that folks have wanted to--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> I just need to get to an answer. We have a lot
of questions here. You can do it or you can't do it without 
conditions? I know you may have conditions, but you can do it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I can release data presuming--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> And so you said you only recently--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --that I do not violate the Privacy Act.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> --released data. Why did it take this long to
release the data and what is it going to take to release the 
rest of the data? If you are going to get private lines into 
the market, they need something to work with. So why did it 
take this long?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Sir, it is something that we have worked on for
a number of years. It hasn't moved fast enough. Part of what I 
did is I had to package up and do modeling related to 
reinsurance last year and I have now released those data.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> Why didn't it move faster? What were the hold-
ups internally?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Wright"> There are some realities related to some
systems that are in place and then how would we package up 
those data to make them available without violating the Privacy 
Act.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Pearce">But when I translate that to West Texan, which
we speak out in New Mexico, it sounds like ``stall.'' I don't 
know. Maybe it is; maybe it is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Pearce">And the problem is that you keep saying that we need to get 
the private sector involved. But when you don't facilitate that 
with the data, and I think Mr. Ross made it very clear that 
that is the basis, then it is just words, that we are going to 
get the private market involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Pearce">It is what your testimony says, but we don't actually ever 
make it possible. We don't ever make the information available. 
So we go year after year after year without that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Pearce">And it gets very frustrating because now the taxpayer is on 
the hook for stuff that you said previously in answer to 
questions that we are not ever going to pay off. You don't see 
a way to pay that off. That is very frustrating for us from 
this side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Pearce">    So when a community is--changing the focus--going to join 
in and participate with FEMA, is there a process you all have 
to get an agreement back and forth?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> Recently, one of the tribes in my district got
FEMA maps published, and that was during the last year. They 
had never entered into an agreement with FEMA, so how did it 
occur that one of the tribes didn't have an agreement, FEMA 
admits it doesn't have a signed agreement, and you go in and 
map? How did that occur?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We have direction and authorities to do mapping
across the country. I would need to go back, sir, and look at 
the specifics in this instance. And in many contexts we are 
doing water--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> But you don't need signatures from Indian
tribes?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We do watershed-based analysis.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> I see. You don't get signatures from Native
American tribes to get into the FEMA system so that the maps 
are drawn. Yes or no?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I require them to give me a signature if they
want to join the program when they are--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Pearce">Okay. So they didn't sign, they didn't indicate
that desire, you all admit that you didn't get the signature, 
but you went ahead and mapped anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Pearce">    I have constituents of mine asking how a Government agency 
proceeded like that without their approval? And I am trying to 
get an answer from you in this hearing today. How did that 
happen?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I can go back and get the specifics on this map
and the information related to the tribe. Ultimately, it is the 
tribe's choice about whether or not to join the national--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Pearce">Yes, but they made the choice not to join. I am
telling you that they made the choice. You did it anyway, and I 
am asking how that moved forward? You said that you require so 
surely the agency had some ability. They have admitted they 
didn't have a signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Pearce">Surely they have the ability, whomever went out and mapped 
it has some requirement or checklist, yes or no, agreement, I 
don't have it, so I probably shouldn't go out there and map 
that and they did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Pearce">    And I am just saying that you need to get me an answer 
because I am being asked to give an answer. And that process 
needs to move rather quickly instead of rather slowly, like the 
whole release of data. I don't want it to take that long, if 
that makes some sense?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We will get you an answer, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> Now, when I look at the $4 billion, 83,000
participants that you paid out, that is $48,000 per person. 
Roughly in my last 28 seconds, how is that money distributed or 
how is that money used? What was it distributed for?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Wright"> When we distribute money post-claim, it is to
pay for the damages to that facility. So we will send out an 
adjuster. We will look at the damages. Once those are 
documented we will pay for the eligible damages up to the 
maximum value of the policy.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> And the $10,000 advance payment, what is that
for?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Wright"> That $10,000 is part of their claim payment. It
is the first piece of that, ensuring that policyholders who 
were insured have money in their hand immediately following the 
event.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> Okay. I will look forward to hearing from you
on the Isleta tribe in my district. Thanks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We will get you that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> I yield back my time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman's time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts,

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Capuano">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Capuano">    And thank you, Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright, you realize we are 
here again doing flood insurance because some people in this 
committee have a blind philosophical commitment to total 
privatization of the flood insurance market. I am just curious. 
Do you think we could privatize it tomorrow?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I think that there is a portion of the risk
that--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> Do you think we can privatize the whole of it?
Right now. We have always had some private entities in the 
market. Nobody, I think, objects to that. Do you think that we 
could privatize the entire flood insurance market now?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Wright"> There is a portion of the risk that I believe
will likely always be with the National Flood Insurance 
Program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> It is a very simple question. Can we do the
whole market or can we not? Yes or no, very simple?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I don't believe we could do that today.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> I thought that was what you would say. I just
wanted you to say it instead of me. Let me ask you a question. 
When you work for FEMA, you don't just work for flood. You also 
work for any other emergencies that happen or any other 
catastrophic--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I have responsibilities across--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> That is right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --a full range of natural hazards.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> Can you tell me if there is a difference if I
lost my home to a flood or a tornado? Do I care about that as 
an individual? Have you ever met an individual who cares how 
they lost their home?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Wright"> At that point, they are focused on the fact
that they lost their home.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> That is what I thought. Yes, we treat them
differently because we don't have a tornado insurance trust 
fund. Is that correct? Did I miss something?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Tornado is covered under the standard
homeowners' policy loss--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> Right. Standard homeowner policy and/or FEMA,
but if there is a massive tornado that comes in and rips up 
thousands of homes, we don't have a typical thing like flood 
insurance?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Most of those residences would be covered in
their homeowners'. FEMA's role oftentimes from a financial 
perspective deals with the community and their infrastructure 
post-disaster.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Capuano">So we come back in, and we still pay them lots
of money. See, I personally think we should have a natural 
disaster insurance fund as opposed to simply flood insurance, 
because I don't think people care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Capuano">It also avoids the argument after the Sandy's and the 
Katrina's of, did your house go away by flood or did your house 
go away by wind? Who cares? Nobody cares except the insurers 
who don't want to pay, which I understand, but nonetheless, I 
would argue that is something we should be looking at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Capuano">I guess, as I was reading your testimony, you did talk 
about privatization for new construction. What do you think it 
would cost if it was just new construction?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Capuano">    If I had a home here and I built the--and it was flood 
insurance and typical, and I built a home right next door. It 
was brand new construction, but the exact same home as was next 
door, what do you think the cost differential would be? About?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Wright"> At that point, the private market actually
priced their risk. What I would tell you is this: Given the 
maps that are in place, the building codes that are in place, 
new construction would be built higher and stronger. It is an 
insurable risk. At that point it is--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> What do you think it would cost? About the
same?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Wright"> It would likely be commensurate to what we
charge.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> Commensurate to what we charge now?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Minus the surcharges and other assessments that
we are required to put on.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> So it would cost more?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Wright"> It would likely cost more.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> Right. And what do you think that would do to
small communities or small businesses that want to expand, 
because new construction is also expansion? Who want to expand 
or want to build a new restaurant or a new little grocery store 
to service people?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Congressman, I think this is why we need to lay
this out and give ourselves a few, 3 years or whatever the 
right number is so that these markets can build out. We will be 
better served--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> Can we do that if we simply kick this can down
the road again like we did? If we just kick this can down the 
road another year or so because we won't be able to come up 
with an answer, do you think that will happen?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Wright"> It would require a more comprehensive action by
this body for us to make this.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> So you think we need to do something that
takes, what, 3 years minimum, 5 years minimum?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I would assert to you that we should work with
the markets. I would say something like 3 years or so, so that 
we can see it build out would be an appropriate piece. At that 
point, the private markets will be there and they should be 
able to respond to those elements.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> You think if we simply do what we have done
already which is to say let's delay it a year, let's just keep 
what we have, because we can't come up with a conclusion, do 
you think that would be a missed opportunity?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I will tell you that my first priority is to
get a multiyear reauthorization done. And that can be done in a 
one-page bill or that can be done in a 300-page bill. The first 
priority is to make sure we don't have the disruption.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> I would agree with that wholeheartedly. By the
way, just out of curiosity, do you realize how many second 
homes there are in, oh, I don't know, let's say Florida?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I don't have that number, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Capuano">I think the answer is a lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Capuano">[laughter]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Capuano">    And how many of them are Mar-a-Lagos versus maybe a small 
condo a few hundred feet from the beach, or maybe even a 
trailer park? Do you have any idea--like a double-wide?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Sir, I don't have a second home, and I don't
have an answer on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Capuano</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Capuano"> I can only tell you my in-laws had a double-
wide, and it wasn't a multimillion dollar home, and it was in 
Florida and they were in a floodplain. And if it went totally 
private they would have had to sell their double-wide, gone 
away, and that town would have lost thousands of residents 
because of it. Thank you, Mr. Wright.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Posey</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Posey">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Posey">Mr. Wright, flood insurance policyholders pay for increased 
cost of compliance, ICCs, as part of the standard policy that 
offers $30,000 to cover the cost of certain mitigation 
measures. So that is up to $30,000 for a policyholder to 
elevate, flood-proof, relocate, et cetera, to come into 
compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Posey">However, they can only access the money after their home 
floods, a claim is filed, and the community makes a 
determination of substantial damage. Usually when I hear the 
word ``mitigation,'' I kind of visualize the word 
``prevention.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Posey">And I don't think it is really mitigation if we are only 
allowing the policyholder to take these measures after the 
fact, after the damage has already been done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Posey">    So the statute does authorize ICC for homeowners who 
receive an offer of pre-flood mitigation, and I'm just 
wondering if you have implemented any part of that statute?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Wright">Given the breadth of my responsibilities, I
will tell you, there is no bigger proponent of building higher 
and stronger from a mitigation perspective than myself. As I 
look at ICC, this increased cost of compliance sits inside an 
insurance program, but it really is a mini-grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Wright">    And so we are told by Congress to set a price. There is a 
cap that is put on that price so that we can collect revenue 
for it. A decision to expand ICC to a higher number or to allow 
it to be applied in more instances would require us to collect 
more revenue related to that increased cost of compliance.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Posey</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Posey"> Okay. So that is why it has not been
implemented. You don't have the revenue.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Posey</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Posey"> Okay. Now, is it true that a few years ago FEMA
considered providing ICC grants before a property floods, when 
it is more cost-effective?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We have considered the pieces in the past. Up
to this point we have implemented the pieces that are 
consistent with the revenue that we bring in.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Posey</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Posey"> Okay. So what happened to the rulemaking when
they were going to do the pre-catastrophe?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Wright">Today, and we can go back to the specifics, I
have a tolerance thing in the statute up to $75 that I can 
collect in premiums towards that increased cost of compliance. 
Those dollars are already being occupied based on those who are 
in the post-event environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Wright">    And so we have looked at this. Given your interest, sir, we 
will look into it more.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Posey</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Posey"> Thank you. On another note, I want to ask about
the flood insurance advocate office. The Homeowner Flood 
Insurance Availability Act created an Office of Consumer Flood 
Insurance Advocate to help homeowners navigate the flood 
insurance questions. Can you give us an update on how this 
office has been able to help consumers since 2014?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Wright">Yes. I think it is one of the things as I look
at HFIAA, as well as Biggert-Waters, that I can say truly has 
produced value and benefit for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Wright">This group has really a sort of independence allowed to 
them. They get the frustrated and confused policyholders. It is 
the last kind of relief valve that is available to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Their caseload has continued to rise as people become more 
aware of it. They work a specific case, but just as important 
to me is the fact that as they look at their caseload, they are 
making recommendations, back to myself and the FEMA 
administrator, about ways that we can improve the program and 
intervene in ways so that we can really be a learning 
organization so that--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Posey</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Posey"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --we don't repeat those problems.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Posey</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Posey"> All right. Now, what is the biggest complaint
you hear from consumers and how can we help address those in a 
reauthorization?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Wright">First, we get some concerns about the rates
that they have to pay and they want to make sure that those 
have been looked at and any way to reduce their rate that they 
can have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Wright">The second piece that they look at is on their 
understanding of the coverages that they have. In the most 
recent report from the advocate that was given to me and has 
been released publicly, he has also highlighted the concerns 
about processing of the ICC, the increased cost of compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Wright">    And then I have a whole smattering of things. Sometimes it 
is on a mapping issue. Sometimes it is on an underwriting issue 
on a--I get a report from him every 60 days looking at kind of 
the throughput of what they are hitting. He can make 
recommendations anytime during the year, and then once a year 
he releases a public report.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Posey</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Posey">Thank you for your frank answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Posey">    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kildee</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Kildee">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Kildee">And thank you, Mr. Wright, for being here, and like my 
colleagues, I am quite concerned that we reauthorize this 
program in a timely fashion. And I think many of us on the 
committee and in this room know what happens when there is 
uncertainty in these markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Kildee">It was not that long ago that we saw TRIA go through a 
similar situation where uncertainty and the uncertainty that 
this Congress would reauthorize that program led to a real 
impact in the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Kildee">And we would certainly hate to see the entire housing 
market impacted by our inability to move and agree with you to 
get a longer-term reauthorization. That is really not the 
direction I would like to take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Kildee">I would like to follow up a little bit on the last set of 
questions. In your answer on consumer concerns, you mentioned a 
few areas. And you indicated one of those areas where I think 
your term was, ``smattering of complaints or concerns'' that 
had to do with mapping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Kildee">I wonder if you first might comment on what your level of 
confidence is or what your assessment is of the accuracy of the 
maps as they currently exist?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Kildee">    I know it is a dynamic process, but in general how would 
you characterize the accuracy of maps that are determining 
which properties fall into the category requiring insurance?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Wright">I would characterize the maps today as
credible. And the nature of the science continues to evolve. 
The nature of the built environment continues to evolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Wright">By statue, the mapping process is done in collaboration 
with the communities. And you can always buy more data. You can 
always buy more precision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I have to work with the resources that I have, and that is 
why from a credibility perspective, when the maps are 
developed, they are then sent to the community for review and 
comment, ultimately going through a formal due process and 
appeal period for 90 days.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kildee</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Kildee">It would seem to me though, having worked in
local government for a very long time and seeing just 
incredible changes in the ability of a community to deal with 
say, planning and zoning or other land use issues through the 
development of new technology with GIS and all the other tools 
that are available, that we ought to be able to be much more 
efficient in terms of updating maps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Kildee">And I raise that because at least in the area that I 
represent, and I am from Michigan, we run into significant 
problems with accuracy and also significant delays with the 
time-consuming nature of the appeal process for individual 
properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Kildee">    What can you say about what is lacking, if anything, in the 
availability of technology or new applications that might make 
more efficient the updating of these maps?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Wright">The single thing that would push us in a
leapfrog forward would be to have an elevation layer, ground 
elevation layer map across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Wright">Today, when we go to build a map, we have to know where the 
ground is. We have to know how much water and we have to know 
how deep it is going to be and then how it is going to interact 
with the built environment in terms of the structures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Wright">Today, we partner with other Federal agencies and State 
agencies to acquire usually LIDARs, the technology that is 
referenced, that light detection radar that is used, but we 
don't have enough of it today. And so there is a significant 
investment that needs to be made in that national elevation 
data layer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Wright">Today, I buy it piecemeal. I buy it one watershed at a 
time, one piece. But what I do know, and we are running a 
couple of pilot projects with States, Minnesota is one of them, 
next-door to you, where they have a State-wide elevation, 
digital elevation data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Wright">    And we are using some of the innovations in technology that 
are speeding things up tremendously because the automation 
works very well when you have highly accurate ground 
elevations.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kildee</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Kildee">I would certainly encourage that and suggest
that you include in any of your recommendations that the 
accuracy issue is really an important one. It affects 
individual customers but it also affects the entire program. 
And I would be really anxious to see some movement in that 
direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Kildee">    And also, if you could just briefly comment in the few 
remaining seconds, on anything that is being done to streamline 
the process for individuals to challenge maps? That can be very 
time-consuming and often becomes irrelevant because of the time 
involved.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Wright">If you want to look at a map amendment on a
single structure basis, when those data are submitted, on 
average, it is a 7-day turnaround time. Some of it can be done 
online within 24 hours. So if you are doing single structure 
data to submit to us, I think it goes pretty quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Wright">    If you are trying to do something that is more of a 
neighborhood scale--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kildee</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Kildee"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Wright">--that map revision process is longer. It
requires us to verify data in a much greater level of 
precision. And we are required under the statute to go through 
due process. And so a draft has to be presented to the 
community. Ultimately, we have to go through the Federal 
Register for a 90-day appeal period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Wright">I do think that this element is one that we could explore 
through reauthorization. In this particular element of it, and 
I know that other Members have asked me about this in the past, 
if there is no objection to the map and the data that was 
generated by the community, well, I don't think we can bypass 
the due process because there may be a homeowner who believes 
that they have an equity in this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I do think we should be looking at ways to leapfrog 
elements and push faster.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kildee</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Kildee">I thank you. And I know my time is over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Kildee">    I thank the chairman for his indulgence. Thank you very 
much.

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rothfus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Rothfus">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Rothfus">    Good morning, Mr. Wright.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Good morning.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rothfus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"> You mentioned in your testimony that at a
national scale, estimates lead FEMA to believe as little as 
one-third of residential properties in the special flood hazard 
area have NFIP policies. What, if anything, does FEMA do to 
coordinate with banking regulators to determine whether 
homeowners with federally-linked mortgages are actually current 
NFIP policyholders?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Wright">We cooperate with the regulators, as I
understand it, and I am not a banking regulation expert. When 
they come in, they do a small sample of the book that may or 
may not even be in the special flood hazard area. If it is, 
they would check to make sure that the right kind of insurances 
are in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Wright">    That cooperation, though, is simply how we deal with the 
enforcement. Where we have focused is, what does it mean to do 
the outreach at the point of a new map and working with the 
agents, as well as the State commissioners, to advocate that 
people do those purchases?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rothfus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"> Is this a reactive or a proactive approach? If
you say that you are cooperating with the banking regulators 
and they are coming in to take a look, that is a little 
different from you proactively going out and assessing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Right. To my understanding, I don't have the
authority to go in and ask to see a bank's book of business and 
do that audit. The banking regulators have that authority. So I 
defer to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the 
other regulators.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rothfus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Rothfus">Yes, and the regulators--the OCC, the Fed, the
FDIC, and the Farm Credit Administration, as well as the NCUA--
issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking last fall in 
November concerning the implementation of the private flood 
insurance provisions of Biggert-Waters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Rothfus">In this release the regulators proposed a provision that 
would allow regulated lending institutions to accept at their 
discretion certain flood insurance policies issued by mutual 
aid societies, which are common in the Amish and Mennonite 
communities in Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Rothfus">    As you may be aware, due to their religious beliefs, 
members of these committees do not purchase traditional 
insurance products, and they have established a long tradition 
of insuring their own communities. How does FEMA view this 
proposal?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Wright"> FEMA has not taken a formal view on that
rulemaking. That said, I believe that what is proposed 
personally is right-headed, and the kind of provision that you 
are highlighting I think is an important one.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rothfus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"> I have heard concerns about homeowners
receiving widely divergent flood insurance quotes from 
different insurance agents. Much of this is likely due to the 
challenges associated with navigating the NFIP. How can we make 
it easier for insurance agents to provide consumers with 
consistent and accurate information?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Wright">Congressman, I think you really have hit the
heart of some of the transformation we are trying to do in the 
program today. It is too complex. And while I don't find it 
acceptable that they are getting different answers, I can 
understand how that can happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Wright">So I think we actually need to get to a point by which, 
given our understanding of the underwriting actuarial 
provisions of the program, we can get to the base information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Today, the application and the questions we ask are far too 
many and there is far too much room for misunderstanding that 
can move one direction or another.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rothfus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"> So what are you doing in that space right now?
Do you have a plan?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We sure do. First--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rothfus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"> When can we expect to see something?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Wright">Later this spring. For the last 8 months we
have been working to rewrite the underwriting manual, which is 
where all of those instructions are at. Frankly, it was not in 
plain language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Wright">Sometime in April, we will be releasing that in beta and 
testing it with the agents on the ground. It will go into full 
effect this summer. We are doing a similar kind of thing on the 
claim side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Wright">Ultimately, we have to look at the coverages because this 
kind of push-pull that happens often gets, well, there are too 
many options that bring too many complexities. And usually they 
don't fully understand that until the day they file a claim. I 
have to bring that forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Ultimately, with this underwriting approach I would like to 
get us to a point by which we are using online and technology-
based ways by which the same answer is being produced every 
single time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rothfus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Rothfus"> Any idea what that would require or what it
would take to make that happen?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Wright">The first thing is we are going through a
modernization of our IT efforts. We actually have gone through 
all the reviews with the Department of Homeland Security and we 
are beginning agile development this spring on elements of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Over the next 2 years, more of those pieces will be in 
place. We are also partnering with the Write Your Own companies 
who can implement these technologies themselves to make sure 
that there are data standards in place to better enable us to 
use technology.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rothfus</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Rothfus">I had to step out and take care of something
outside, so you might have been asked this question already, 
but I just wanted to see what the answer is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Rothfus">    As I have studied the NFIP, I have noticed how difficult it 
is to get complete and usable data, I can only imagine how 
difficult it would be for firms in the private sector that want 
to get into the flood insurance business to get a better 
understanding of the NFIP's historical data. Is there a 
provision in the law or some other reason that FEMA cannot 
share this information with insurers?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. Wright">The chief concern is one related to the Privacy
Act. What I have done, and again, I have been pushed rightfully 
on this because we did not make enough progress on it, we were 
able to do some new modeling last year related to reinsurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Wright">    It was sufficient for the reinsurers to price the products 
for me. And I have recently released most of the data that we 
worked on with those reinsurers and they are now available to 
be downloaded from FEMA.gov.

    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. Waters">Let me just say to Mr. Wright, I appreciate you being here 
and sharing with us how FEMA works. You are in an untenable 
position. You were asked by Mr. Duffy, what is your plan for 
reduction of the debt?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Ms. Waters">I wish you could have told him there is no such thing as a 
plan for the reduction of the debt. We are paying $4 billion a 
year on this debt. The Congress of the United States of America 
will have to make a decision about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Ms. Waters">And I don't know what my colleagues are thinking, but I use 
the word ``forgiveness.'' I really do believe that we need to 
forgive this debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Ms. Waters">This agency needs a revolution, and it starts with 
forgiving the debt. There is no way that you could plan to 
forgive this debt by raising the premiums or doing some of the 
other things that you say that you do in order to come up with 
premium costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Ms. Waters">You talk about loss claims data, future expected losses. 
You can redo that a thousand times, but it is not going to 
reduce this debt. And so I am going to be working very hard to 
try and convince my colleagues that we need to really, really 
step up to the plate and deal with this issue and this issue of 
debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Ms. Waters">Having said that, when I talk about a revolution, in 
addition to forgiving the debt I think the Members of Congress 
really do need to understand all of the calculations that go 
into determining premiums.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Ms. Waters">You talk about loss claims data and there seems to be some 
misunderstanding about whether or not you are actually using 
this. I heard the questioning on this issue and it sounded as 
if you said that is part of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Ms. Waters">We don't know how much of that is taken into consideration. 
I heard you talk about future expected losses. How much of 
that? How is that calculated? Is this truly scientific, on and 
on and on?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Ms. Waters">I would like to say to the chairman of this committee, who 
is sitting here, that we need to have a special task force on 
flood insurance alone so that you would be able to take the 
agency apart, working with the members of the special task 
force to understand how you come up with your calculations. And 
I think that if we started out anew with these premium 
policies, we could correct a lot of things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Ms. Waters">There have been problems with mapping historically. And my 
staff just brought me a copy of a press release that we did 
about a mapping area in Los Angeles that I got involved in, in 
2010, where we worked with FEMA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Ms. Waters">And FEMA changed because when they took a look at what the 
citizens were complaining about and the whole area, and the 
fact that it had never had a flood, on and on and on. When they 
gave consideration to all of these things, they changed their 
mind about the way that mapping had taken place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Ms. Waters">The other thing that I discovered in working on this issue 
was I know that you send the notices or information to the 
cities. And the cities have an opportunity to raise questions, 
to talk with the community, but oftentimes they don't do 
anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Ms. Waters">You send that information to the cities and it just goes 
into a file somewhere and the citizens don't get an opportunity 
to really have the cities working with them to bring their 
concerns to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Ms. Waters">And so for all of these reasons, I think that we really do 
need to have this change, this big change, this revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Ms. Waters">Now, on top of all of my concerns and even what we did, 
after we changed our minds about Biggert-Waters and we came up 
with the repeal, we didn't treat those small businesses right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Ms. Waters">And everybody on this committee claims to be concerned 
about our small businesses, but yet when we take a look back at 
what we did and what their responsibility is in terms of 
premium cost, it really must be corrected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Ms. Waters">Now on top of that--you had nothing to do with this--to 
fund the border wall, the Trump Administration weighs cuts to 
Coast Guard, airport security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Ms. Waters">Your name is not in the headlines but the proposal drawn by 
the Office of Management and Budget would also slash the budget 
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides 
disaster relief after hurricanes, tornadoes, and other natural 
disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Ms. Waters">The Coast Guard, $9.1 billion in 2017 would be cut, 14 
percent to about $7.8 billion. The TSA and FEMA budgets would 
be reduced about 11 percent each to $4.5 billion and $3.6 
billion. This is outrageous and unconscionable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Ms. Waters">And so Mr. Chairman, I hope that you are listening and you 
are going to take this into consideration. You can pound all 
you want. Be--</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Ms. Waters">    [laughter]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> You are over your time, Ranking Member
Waters.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Waters</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Ms. Waters"> The ranking member would respectfully request
unanimous consent for 30 more seconds?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Without objection--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Waters</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Ms. Waters"> Thank you so very much.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> --because you are so compelling.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Waters</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Ms. Waters">I just wanted the 30 seconds to say that you
now have a big responsibility, and you asked the question of 
Mr. Wright when he came in about what he was going to do to 
reduce the debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Ms. Waters">I hope that you have paid attention so that you know that 
all he can do is continue to pay that $4.0 billion every year 
on this outrageous debt. And I hope that you are hearing some 
of us when we ask you to take consideration for eliminating 
this debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Ms. Waters">    This is natural disasters and our taxpayers deserve better. 
And I don't intend to sit here and work on any increased 
premiums. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> To the ranking member, thank you. It was
only a minute and 38 seconds over your time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Waters</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Ms. Waters"> Thank you for that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Chairman Duffy">I have been trying to be generous to let
Mr. Wright finish his questions if he is over, but to you the 
exception goes, Ranking Member Waters. With that, your time has 
definitely expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Trott">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. Trott">Just a point of clarification, Mr. Wright, and thank you 
for being here. The ranking member has mentioned a couple of 
times in her questioning and in the opening statement how 
unfair, and I believe she means $400 million in interest a 
year, not $4 billion, but how unfair it is that we are 
collecting this interest and it is how it is costing the 
program and that is the reason for the inability to repay the 
$24 billion, and it should be forgiven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Trott">    Just a point of clarification. It is really not costing the 
program $400 million a year. It is costing the taxpayers $25 
billion at the moment. Isn't that a correction that needs to be 
made? It is the taxpayers, right? That is what I am talking 
about.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Wright"> The taxpayers have loaned us $24.5 billion.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Trott"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Wright"> The policyholders are paying $400 million of
their premium toward servicing that debt.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Trott"> So let's talk about your solution. In your
opening statement you talked about the need to have the private 
sector play a greater role. And so I assume that you believe 
that the private sector would step in to fill this need if we 
remove some of the barriers and maybe figure out a way to 
better share the data. Is that a fair assumption?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Wright">I think that is an element of it. I think time
would have to show what the private sector would do. Over the 
last 49 years, the National Flood Insurance Program has been, I 
don't know that those markets have flourished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I would note that there already are private markets selling 
the excess coverage, as well as in some States there are flood 
riders that are particularly used for areas outside the high-
risk area.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Trott">Right. And so I am concerned about as we move
towards a long-term solution as part of any reauthorization, 
kind of the sticker shock issue. Allegedly, one of the 
unintended consequences of Biggert-Waters was the sticker shock 
that some of the homeowners experienced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Trott">    So do you believe there is a way, over a period of years, 
to implement a solution that greater involves the private 
sector that would allow for actuarial sound premiums to be put 
in place where homeowners wouldn't lose their homes?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Wright">Congressman, Congress is going to need to make
some choices for me about that, and I can implement them. In 
this instance, what I will tell you is there is no more 
effective risk communication tool than a pricing signal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Wright">And I was in communities, actually sat next to Members 
doing town hall meetings in the intervening time between 
Biggert-Waters and the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability 
Act, where I heard the outcry in terms of the impact from an 
affordability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Wright">    So there is a push-pull--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Trott"> And could that been avoided? Is that something
we could have avoided, in hindsight? If there is part of any 
solution we don't want to have that happen again, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I would assert that all of us would be better
off if we didn't have that happen again.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Trott"> None of us wants that. So is there a solution
that you can envision? Is it possible to avoid that scenario?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Wright">The first step that we are already taking under
Section 28 of the Homeowners Affordability Act is to clearly 
communicate risk. And so this is the first year that we are 
pushing out a notification that says, here is your premium but 
this is what the full risk rate would be, or at least the range 
of what your full risk rate would be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Wright">    We still are implementing escalations in the policies that 
move us there. I think the 2014 Act put a much longer time 
horizon on it whereas the 2012 bill did it quite quickly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Mr. Trott">Okay. So part of the problem, as I understand
it, is approximately 1.6 percent of the 5.1 million 
policyholders account for 24 percent of the claims. At least 
that is the statistic that was shared with me yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Trott">    So how does the solution in your mind address that problem? 
Because that seems to be the crux of the issue is we have 
85,000 policyholders who are accounting for the vast--an 
inordinate number of claims.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Wright">I think when you look at the insurance realm,
it is not unusual to have a small segment that is occupying a 
good bit of the claims payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. Wright">For me what is highlighted, and this is not always popular, 
but I think we have to look at those repetitive loss properties 
because under the statute today, I am required to continue to 
offer them coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Wright">    And there may be a point that we should draw that says if 
your total payouts of claims exceeds 200 percent of your policy 
limits, or some other number, I offer that hypothetically to 
you--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Trott"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Wright">--we are in a position by which you need to get
your insurance through another means. You need to have lost the 
ability to have those cheaper rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I think we have to look at that. I would point us back to 
some things learned from 2004's reauthorization, where there 
was an attempt at a ``three strikes and you are out.'' I don't 
think that worked as effectively, but we could find a way to 
draw that line.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Trott">Thank you. I agree with your comments, and while
my time is running out, I come from Michigan, the Great Lakes 
State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Trott">    What is the status on sharing the data that is being 
collected by Sea Storm in terms of the flooding patterns for 
the lakes, because they are much different, obviously, than the 
coastal areas? And when can that be available to my 
constituents? And does the same privacy concern hold you up 
from doing that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Wright">The privacy concern only deals with address-
specific claims data. The work that we are doing on the Great 
Lakes today is ongoing. We will work with your office to make 
sure that is made available to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Wright">    We are partnering with the State of Michigan and the 
communities to share that data. As you know, the lakes have 
been on a downward trajectory, and I think you will see that 
reflected in the update of the maps.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Trott</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Trott"> Thank you for your time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman's time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Nevada for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kihuen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">And thank you, Mr. Wright, for your presentation and for 
being here this morning. I have a couple of questions relating 
to climate change. Climate change is a real threat. And I think 
we are going to start seeing folks get washed out more and more 
often.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">I believe we will see more Superstorm Sandy's, which will 
cost the program billions and billions of dollars. Are you 
taking climate change into account while you are doing your 
mapping?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">    And secondly, if we see an acceleration in extreme weather 
events, wouldn't this add further debt to the NFIP? And is this 
something we should be concerned about as we work towards 
reauthorization?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Wright">There are a number of future risks that we have
to consider in the National Flood Insurance Program. Climate 
variability, climate change is one of those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Wright">In 2012, Congress directed us to use our Technical Mapping 
Advisory Committee--it has been a very beneficial group for 
us--to specifically look at this. They have delivered a report 
to us related to future risk and future conditions and how we 
would map that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Wright">I do think that we could benefit from showing that risk to 
communities in a more forward way, but let me draw two 
important distinctions. When we are charging insurance 
premiums, we should do it based on today's risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Wright">I should inform the built environment based on our 
understanding of the future, but I shouldn't be charging a 
premium based on a risk that has not yet arrived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Wright">The second piece that I would highlight is, and we released 
a report in 2013 to this end, as you look at the changes that 
we anticipate between now and 2100, there are changes in 
climate. But a third of that change in risk is wholly 
attributable to changes in the built environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Essentially, where do the next 50 million people live? 
Where do we build their homes and their condos and their 
apartments? Where do those pieces sit, and how is that sited? 
Because frankly, every time we keep building, if we don't do it 
intelligibly on the way in, we exacerbate those flood risks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kihuen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">Thank you, Mr. Wright. My other question has to
do with rural America, and my district is for the most part 
very rural. On the one hand, we saw in the aftermath of 
Hurricane Sandy that there were serious concerns about 
engineers not having the proper expertise to be handling flood 
claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">But on the other hand, it can be difficult to find a 
sufficient number of qualified professionals in the area in the 
aftermath of a storm this size. That was in New York and New 
Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">My district includes Las Vegas, but it also goes all the 
way up, almost to Reno. For my East Coast colleagues, that is 
the same distance between Washington, D.C., and Boston or 
Atlanta. I have a number of constituents who reside in rural 
counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">And though we definitely don't have the flood issues some 
of my colleagues do, these counties do have thousands of NFIP 
policies that have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">    What is FEMA doing to ensure that we have a sufficient 
number of qualified professionals handling claims in the 
aftermath of a storm, especially in rural counties?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Wright">Let me take the rural county piece first, and
then I will broaden out to the broader piece. As we look at 
rural counties, we see flooding go on most weeks of the year in 
some rural county across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Wright">The number of claims we would see in those instances are 
low enough by which I can get enough adjusters and the like on 
the ground pretty readily, which allows us to close out those 
claims and get them paid in a very timely way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Wright">It is usually in an urban context, think more of your Las 
Vegas context, by which I start seeing tens and hundreds of 
thousands of claims. And that is the point that stresses the 
system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Wright">So what have we been doing to address the stresses on the 
system? We have been working with the companies to ensure that 
we are building out more capacity for adjusters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Wright">We are also looking at technology. Technology first of all 
to do the quality control to ensure that there is not 
sloppiness, there aren't inadvertent errors being made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Wright">    But also ways that I can imagine in the years to come for 
claims being able to be adjusted by people taking pictures on 
their smartphone. And when this is a smaller scale, this is a 
$10,000 or $20,000 claim, I can imagine them taking pictures, 
uploading those to us, and us adjusting this remotely, which 
saves a tremendous amount of time and we would be able to get 
those dollars paid far quicker.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kihuen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">Thank you, Mr. Wright.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Kihuen">    I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the chairman of the full Financial 
Services Committee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, 
for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Hensarling</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Chairman Hensarling">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you
on behalf of the full committee for holding this hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Chairman Hensarling">Mr. Wright, I just want to follow up on a couple of items 
that you have already testified on, and particularly I want to 
follow up first on the question from the gentleman from 
Michigan, Mr. Trott, which has to do with the repetitive loss 
properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Chairman Hensarling">I don't quite recall the term of art, whether it was 
``severe repetitive loss'' or simply ``repetitive loss,'' but 
approximately 2 percent of the properties are accounting for 
roughly 24 percent of the losses historically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Chairman Hensarling">    You mentioned the 2004 effort, kind of a ``three strikes 
and you are out.'' So could you give us a few other thoughts 
and approaches on how FEMA is thinking about these repetitive 
loss properties, and any different approaches you would bring 
to the committee's attention?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Wright">Right. There are some nuances to the 2004
piece, but overplayed 3 claims of $1,000 apiece would strike 
you out, and I don't think that was ever quite the intent we 
are looking at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Wright">And so the first thing I think we need to do is actually 
move the threshold of what we consider the repetitive loss. 
Where is the big money going as opposed to some things that may 
just be some nuances that were applied?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Wright">As I have thought about it, and we have begun going through 
the data, and my team hasn't finished on this point yet, there 
is a point by which we have to draw a line that says if you 
exceed--is it 150 percent or 200 percent of your policy 
limits--at least we need to take the subsidies and 
grandfathering away from you and you need to be paying at its 
face value, actuarial premium. Or we should tell you to get 
that on the private market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Wright">There is the other side of that coin by which some of these 
are in places where the homeowners are of less means and 
wouldn't be able to actually take that on. And so I think we 
have to look at that dimension of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Mr. Wright">    But the face of it is in any other kind of insurance piece 
that third, that fourth time to the well, we change the rules 
somehow. And I think it would be wise for us to do so.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Hensarling</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Chairman Hensarling"> Mr. Wright, if I could suggest that
your staff prioritize analyzing--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We will do so.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Hensarling</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Chairman Hensarling"> --this particular data? I share your
goal of having a long-term reauthorization--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Hensarling</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Chairman Hensarling">--and maybe September 30th is looming
large, but this is an important part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Chairman Hensarling">    You also, I guess fairly early on in your testimony, spoke 
of mitigation, and one or two other Members also spoke of it. 
So I think the grant program is a relatively small portion--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Hensarling</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Chairman Hensarling"> --of the FEMA budget today. But could
you expound upon your thoughts, and again, other matters you 
would bring to the committee's attention in the mitigation 
space?

    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Mr. Wright">The mitigation investments pay off over and
over again. I have three different grant programs that I am 
accountable for. One of them is funded by the Stafford Act 
after events. That is where there is anywhere between $700 
million and $1 billion a year spent in that space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Wright">Congress then also created a Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund, 
which averages about $100 million a year. And then inside the 
National Flood Insurance Program, we have a Flood Mitigation 
Assistance Program. That is paid for by the premiums of 
policyholders. So $175 million, which is not enough to actually 
mitigate risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Wright">And I kind of look at these upper limits of $26 billion or 
$45 billion worth of risk that I could assume in any given year 
and what do those pieces look like?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Wright">The limited pot I have today I prioritize on repetitive 
loss, severe repetitive loss properties all moved to the top 
because that benefits the fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Wright">I think we would do more to help communities if we started 
taking on projects that were a bit larger at a community scale. 
So rather than do three houses on that block, what does it mean 
to actually take that entire block out of harm's way?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Wright">    The question is where do the resources come from? Where do 
the resources come from to pay those bills? I don't know how 
much more policyholders can bear, and I don't know what the 
appetite is for that to come out of general authorization.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Hensarling</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Chairman Hensarling"> In the seconds I have remaining here,
you have indicated a desire to open up greater space to the 
private market. The committee shares that particular goal. I 
know we have had a fulsome dialogue between your office and 
this committee. But is there any barrier to entry, as you 
understand it, that has not been brought to our attention?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Mr. Wright">I think there is a reality that when these
markets stand up, they are going to be subject to State 
regulation, appropriately so, McCarran-Ferguson gives that 
responsibility there. And they need to be able to price a 
product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Wright">But I think what is keeping us from actually seeing it 
broaden up is what does it mean to actually establish, they 
will guard against concentrations, which I don't today. They 
will have to make sure that their rates are affordable and that 
they don't push and pull out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. Wright">But I really see that we need to move to an appetite, 
because one of the things I have pushed the private markets on 
is today I am responsible for assessing a surcharge of $250 on 
any second home. I look at properties outside the mandatory 
purchase, the preferred risk, and I am putting a $250 tax on 
top of a $350 premium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Mr. Wright">And I have told the private markets that this is a perfect 
place where I have a competitive disadvantage. You should be 
coming in and filling this space. This is cheap, insurable 
risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Yet, I am not seeing that expansion happen yet. And so 
there needs to be some motivation that will keep pushing them 
down that road. And I think that will be as a step-wise process 
for us.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Hensarling</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Chairman Hensarling"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The chairman's time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. 
Green, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Green</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Green">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And if my
friend, the Chair of the full committee, needs additional time 
I will be honored to yield to him, without any questions I 
might add.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Green">    Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Ranking Member, I thank you for this 
hearing. And Mr. Chairman, if I may say so, I want to 
congratulate you on being promoted to this subcommittee, but I 
will tell you that I enjoyed serving with you on O&amp;I. We didn't 
always agree, but I always enjoyed the opportunity to serve 
with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> You were always agreeable.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Green</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Green">Thank you so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Green">Mr. Wright, thank you for your appearance today. There are 
some aspects of your job that are complicated by virtue of 
things that we can do here in Congress and that we haven't 
done. An example would be in Houston, Texas, wherein we have 
floods that total $100 million and it is not unusual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Green">We had the Memorial Day flood in 2015 which was about $100 
million, and we had the tax day flood in 2016 which was about 
$1.9 billion by some estimates. It depends on who is counting 
and how you count.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Green">People have lost their lives: in 2015, 8 people; in 2016, 9 
people. FEMA paid out $57 million with reference to the 
Memorial Day flood in 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Green">Now, I mention these circumstances because there are 
projects that are on the docket of the Army Corps of Engineers 
that if completed would eliminate some of the flooding and 
mitigate a good deal of the flooding as well. These projects 
total about $311 million. We are spending a lot of money after 
the fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Green">    We spend millions after the flooding, after the damage, but 
we could spend millions also before and mitigate and eliminate. 
Would you care to comment on what I have just said, sir?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Wright">I think this investment before the disaster is
imperative. And while I cannot speak to the specifics of the 
Corps' investments and budget, I can and I would highlight for 
you a report and some findings by the Government Accountability 
Office last year where they directed an interagency group that 
I chair to develop a national mitigation investment strategy so 
that we harmonize Federal investments, and we find ways to 
incentivize more private investments in this space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I would assert there are not enough Federal dollars to 
eliminate all the risk across all the communities in this 
country. We have to find ways to engage the private sector in 
that, and I do think that we collectively could find a better 
way to harmonize those programs. I expect some work later this 
summer to be done to demonstrate the progress there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Green</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Green"> Thank you. With reference to our sharing risk,
you are well aware that at one time the insurance companies had 
the entire market.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Green</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Green"> And we are in the market now because it became
too much for them to bear. Would you kindly explain to us the 
consequences of the Federal Government moving to becoming the 
insurer of last resort only and allowing the market to manage 
the other aspects of these disasters?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. Wright">Yes. In many ways, I would say we are the
residual market today because there is a limited amount that is 
done through private flood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Mr. Wright">And 49 years ago, there was a limited market, and where it 
was, the prices were quite exorbitant. I think as we look at 
these dimensions, we have to find the right balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Wright">Florida Citizens is often held up as an example for me to 
look at and they still retain a half million policies through 
their citizens program that the private market did not take up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Wright">And so those policies would be there and so what would that 
equivalent be inside the National Flood Insurance Program? It 
is impossible to know precisely, but there could be 3 million 
or more policies that we are left with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Wright">Yet, those are the ones that would be at greatest risk with 
greatest kind of concentrations of that risk, and where we 
would pay those bills becomes difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Wright">    In the Florida example, they have a whole series of ways by 
which all the taxpayers of Florida and all the rate payers in 
Florida would contribute to pay those bills. We don't have 
those mechanisms in the National Flood Insurance Program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Green</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Green">Mr. Chairman, I know my time is up. May I
introduce some things into the record, please?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Green">    I have a resolution from the Commissioner's Court in Harris 
County supporting our reauthorization. I would also like to 
introduce H.R. 121, which is the bill that would allow us to 
fund those projects that have been authorized by this Congress 
that would help us mitigate in Harris County. I ask unanimous 
consent to enter these documents into the record.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Without objection, the documents will be
made a part of the record.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Green</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Green"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Chairman Duffy">With that, the gentleman's time has
expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. 
MacArthur, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">We have talked about what I think should be our priorities 
in this reauthorization--affordability, certainly mitigation is 
critical. I want to focus for a few moments on accountability, 
which I think needs to be a priority as well. And all of my 
questions and comments come out of whom I represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">    I represent southern New Jersey, the epicenter of 
Superstorm Sandy. On October 29, 2012, my district was 
devastated: lives, homes, businesses, neighborhoods, and 
communities. And we have all probably seen photos of the iconic 
Jet Star rollercoaster sitting in the ocean. That is my 
district.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">We have seen photos of the house sitting on
a little island in the middle of a newly created inlet that 
went right through an island. That is my district. Those are 
the people I represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">And you mentioned earlier, Mr. Wright, 144,000 flood claims 
came out of that event. And of those 73,000, about half, were 
in the State of New Jersey, and of those, 36,000 were in my 
home county--50 percent of the claims in New Jersey were in my 
home county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">    Do you know how many people--I don't expect you probably 
do--who are still out of their homes now, nearly 5 years later?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I don't, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"> Thousands. Thousands of them. And might you
guess the leading cause for people to still be out of their 
homes 5 years later?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Wright"> No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">It is a gap. And it works like this. There
are resources from a flood policy, maybe resources from a FEMA 
grant like a REM grant to lift a home. There are resources from 
an SBA loan. There are private savings that people have put 
away for retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">    And they keep inching towards completion and they run out 
of money, 95 percent there but they can't get a certificate of 
occupancy.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"> So getting paid fairly at every step of that
chain is absolutely essential for my constituents. And that is 
where I want to focus for a few moments. What percentage of the 
underwriting risk does a Write Your Own carrier take?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Zero.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"> Zero. Would an engineer or an adjuster have
any financial incentive for depressing the amount of a claims 
payment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Wright"> They should not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">They should not. I want to read to you
testimony, not testimony, but commentary from your predecessor 
I believe, Brad Kieserman, who in February of 2015 said this on 
60 Minutes, that he ``had seen evidence of fraud in reports 
used to deny them, the policyholders, full insurance payouts.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">Again I am quoting: ``I am not going to sit here and 
conceal the fact that it happened because in the last 3 weeks, 
I have seen evidence of it,'' said Kieserman. He went on to say 
that they had seen evidence in late 2013, a year after the 
storm, but nothing had happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">    I am going to ask you, Mr. Wright, to look at the two 
photos that are up on the wall. Do they look like the same 
photograph to you, left and right? I assure you they are and 
they came out of your files.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"> I would ask you to read what is circled on
the photo on the left.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Mr. Wright"> ``Floodwaters damage heater and boiler.''
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"> Okay. And that was dated November 12th. Then
on the right side is the photograph that was sent to the 
insured on 11/26 when their claim was denied. Can I ask you to 
read what is in the circled box on the insured's photograph?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Wright"> ``Floodwaters do not damage water heater and
boiler.''
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">I don't have time, unfortunately, to put up
a series of these very similar photographs, but I assure you 
and I trust that you will accept that it is accurate, that they 
all do the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">    You reopened thousands of claims under some pressure by me 
and others. Can I ask how much you have paid from all of those 
reopened and litigated claims in the latter part of the 
process?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We have paid out an additional $350 million so
far.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"> I am going to stop you there because I have
only 30 seconds left, and I have to end with commentary.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> I would ask for unanimous consent to give
the gentleman 1 more minute of time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"> I'm very grateful for that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Without objection, it is so ordered.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">You were under pressure in FEMA, and I
recognize you weren't in the role then, but FEMA under pressure 
allowed my constituents to reopen claims--50 percent of the 
claims in my State, 25 percent of the claims in this entire 
episode, you reopened them and you paid out $300 million you 
just testified--$300 million that would not have come to my 
State had you not been under pressure to reopen these claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">    Sir, I beg you, and I am telling you that when we 
reauthorize, we will be watching to make sure that there is 
accountability in the process. The McKinsey study that was 
implemented by your company suggested that your adjusters ought 
to pay within ranges. Is that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Wright"> So--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">I don't have time to actually let you
answer. I know that is what it did because we have had plenty 
of testimony that it did. We had five whistleblowers that I 
have statements from, affidavits from. I will read you the 
quote from two of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">``We received instructions not to conduct a comprehensive 
evaluation of claims. We were directed to tailor evaluations to 
fall within a range even if we identified additional covered 
damage.'' That was one of your employees who was a 
whistleblower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">Another said, ``There was an elaborate process designed to 
justify minimum payments to policyholders irrespective of the 
actual merits of the claim.'' Mr. Wright, this is completely 
unacceptable--$300 million of additional funds paid that would 
have been denied but for the pressure that was on your agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">You are charged with helping the very people who have 
suffered the most, and my constituents got cheated. And so did 
others across New Jersey and across New York, and you have to 
fix that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">You have to fix that process so that people at least are 
getting paid what they are owed and it doesn't create a gap 
that keeps them out of their home for years after these events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">    I yield back. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman's time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the former Chair of this 
subcommittee, who is now the current Chair of the Financial 
Institutions Subcommittee, the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. 
Luetkemeyer, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">    And Mr. Wright, it's good to see you again.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes, sir. Likewise.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">I know that a number of the things that
were discussed today were happening and were consequential 
prior to your taking over. I know that in working with you over 
the last couple of years here you have done a pretty good job 
under your leadership of improving the claims process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">    As my colleague next to me here has pointed out, there were 
a lot of mistakes made.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We are--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> And I know that the last two storms we had
this last summer, this past year, there were not that many 
mistakes made--as many mistakes. Put it that way. I know that 
as chairman, we wound up with a lot fewer complaints, and so I 
congratulate you on improving your process. There's always room 
for improvement, of course, but--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Agreed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">--I think that you have also, improving
the process, going to advance payments has been a big help. And 
so I think one of the things we have and one of the things that 
is in our bill, in fact, is taking some of those improvements 
and trying to put them into the statute. So we thank you for 
that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">    And obviously, one of the things that is a big concern to 
my colleagues and myself is the reinsurance, trying to find a 
way to take the taxpayers off the hook. Can you tell me what 
the size of the two losses were last year? What was the size of 
the two events?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Mr. Wright"> The total loss last year was about $4.2
billion.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Mr. Wright"> And the largest was that Louisiana one alone
was $2.4 billion.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Okay. So if we would have had reinsurance
and would have kicked in at the billion dollar level, we would 
have had $2 billion worth of reinsurance and you wouldn't have 
had to increase the debt from $23 billion to $24.6 billion, 
right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Wright"> So--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Yes. I can do the math, Mr. Wright.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Wright">You can. So I learned quite a bit when I went
to the markets at the end of last year on the price points. And 
the attachment that we bought at $4 billion was the place where 
the optimization of the pricing began to kick in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Pricing below--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Well--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --at $4 billion--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">With all due respect, Mr. Wright, the
pricing of this is obviously important. But at the end of the 
day, what you are talking about is the flood insurance program 
and having the taxpayers be the backstop. Right now, the 
taxpayers are the reinsurers of the NFIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">And the program is not structurally sound. It is not 
actuarially sound, because obviously we have a loss of $24.6 
billion sitting there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">    And if we would have had reinsurance in place that would 
have kicked in at the billion dollar level this past year, we 
wouldn't have added another $1.6 billion to our debt.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Mr. Wright"> That is true.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">And so I think the reinsurance, to me, is
the most important thing we can do because it takes the 
taxpayers off the hook and we can finally begin to go down the 
road of getting this program under control. And from there, we 
can start working on getting the actuarial rates more sound and 
work on things like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">    With regards to the data, I want to go quickly to that. I 
know that there were a couple of questions with regards to the 
data collection. What kind of information when you have a 
policy, what information, personal data, is collected on a 
policyholder when you do your application--name, address, 
birthdate, Social Security number?

    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We do not take Social Security numbers any
longer, but--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> I see.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --name, address, birthdate, value of
structures, and ultimately we end up with loss history attached 
to that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Okay. So when you gave the loss history to
the reinsurance folks, all of this data--the name, address, 
personal data--was given over to them or not?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I created a derivative product based on zip
code that was sufficient for them to provide me pricing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Okay. So you didn't give individual--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Wright"> They knew exactly how many--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> --addresses?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Mr. Wright"> They knew exactly how many claims, the value of
each of those claims, but they were generalized at the zip code 
level. They didn't get the street address. And that was--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> They didn't get the street address, didn't
get names--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> --so the data of those people was
protected?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Okay. With regards to--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Mr. Wright"> And those are the data, sir, that I have
recently released on FEMA's website that are now downloadable.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Right. To me, the mapping is another very
important part of this. My information shows that last year you 
had 25,000 letters of map amendment called LOMA letters at a 
cost of $13 million. Is that accurate, or close to it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Those numbers seem correct to me.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Okay. So we have the maps that are off,
25,000 people around this country had to spend anywhere from 
$300 to $500 and $700 to get themselves out of the program and 
show that they didn't need to have that coverage. And one of 
the things that I think is important is, can you get the maps 
corrected every year?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I am constrained by the number of resources
that I have to spend on those maps.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> And the reason I ask the question is, how
often do you get to being able to remap?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I am required by statute to evaluate them at
least every 5 years and then resource-dependent drives the 
amount of investment that I make.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Are we lucky to do it every 10 years?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Mr. Wright"> In most areas--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> I see you are smiling, so I am not too far
off.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Wright"> No, no. In the risky areas--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Okay. All right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --and I have to be careful given the rural
nature of some parts of the country. The riskier the area, the 
more policies I have there. I am basically on a 5- to 6-year 
cycle. In other cases, it may be closer to 10 years before they 
have an update.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">So my comment would be that one of the
things we are looking at trying to do is go to at least every 3 
years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">    If you are not able to go back and redo this, allow the 
local folks, if they adhere to certain criteria, to be able to 
do their own maps and then have them approved. Is that 
acceptable to you?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Mr. Wright"> And it is acceptable under today's authorities
as they exist today. I will take data from a community--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer"> Great.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --at any time from that provision.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Luetkemeyer</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">I am being timed out. I appreciate the
indulgence by the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Mr. Luetkemeyer">    Thank you very much, Mr. Wright.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman's time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. 
Hultgren, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hultgren</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">And thanks for being here, Mr. Wright. My district is the 
suburbs of Chicago, and the Fox River cuts directly through the 
center of my district. It is bordered by towns and cities like 
Fox Lake, Crystal Lake, Elgin, St. Charles, Oswego, Yorkville, 
and Plano, not to mention the lakes in the northern part of my 
district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">    I believe we should maintain affordable access to flood 
insurance, but we also must be fiscally responsible. I think 
that has been a common theme today. First question, is it true 
that FEMA is no longer able to even make interest payments on 
its debt? Yes or no?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Mr. Wright"> In January, I borrowed the resources necessary
to make the interest payment for March.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hultgren</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Mr. Hultgren"> When will FEMA technically default on its
obligation or have they done so already?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I would not use that word in relationship to
this program. There are people who have purchased those 
Treasury bills and they have the full faith and credit of the 
United States behind them.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hultgren</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">I am still very concerned with the delays of
payment and failure, well, we will see question marks on how 
that will continue to be paid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">Certainly, I think all of us are concerned with the amount 
of debt NFIP has accumulated. I can certainly understand some 
risk in providing insurance, but there is also an expectation 
that it should be properly managed, whether it is provided by 
the public sector or the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">However, in the case of the public sector, as we say, 
taxpayers are left holding the bag. Your testimony states that 
a quick succession in severe storms is the primary cause for 
the NFIP being about $25 billion in debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">Your testimony also states that conservatively, Hurricane 
Katrina has a 2 percent chance of occurring in a given year; 
Hurricane Sandy has a 5 percent chance; and the August 2016 
storm in Louisiana has a 4 percent chance. Combined, the chance 
of all three happening is extremely low, less than one-tenth of 
1 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">    Do you believe FEMA was doing a poor job of accounting for 
the risk? Or do you believe they were collecting insufficient 
premiums to account for this risk?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We were collecting the premiums generally
allowable under the statute. So nearly 80 percent of my book is 
actuarially sound. The other 20 percent of it has statutorily 
directed discounts and subsidies that I live within.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hultgren</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="579" speaker="Mr. Hultgren"> What changes should FEMA make to avoid ever
accruing this much debt again? Do any of these policies require 
action by Congress to make sure the debt never gets this big 
again?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Mr. Wright">Absolutely, sir. When I talk about a sound
financial framework and bringing transparency, we need Congress 
on that front. We can look at the amount of premium and may 
make adjustments in that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Mr. Wright">    We can look at kind of what is repayable debt, simple 
liquidity that I might need in any given year, the use of 
reinsurance, which we have a cornerstone and we will continue 
to build. But there are tipping points based on events by which 
only Congress will be able to help me solve those.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hultgren</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">Let me get into a specific circumstance in my
district. I mentioned St. Charles. This is a city in my 
district that had a significant amount of trouble working with 
your agency last year to update the flood maps along the 7th 
Avenue Creek.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">There has been significant flooding here in recent years so 
the City of St. Charles would like to undertake development 
projects to manage the flood risk in this area, which has a 
number of businesses and homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">    The problem is FEMA took an agonizingly long time to update 
the maps, which caused significant uncertainty for the 
community. It has now been resolved, finally, but I want to 
know what steps FEMA plans to take to prevent this from 
happening to other communities in Illinois and around the 
country, this unacceptable delay?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Mr. Wright">First of all, I apologize for the delay. We
need to be efficient--we take in the data that communities give 
us and process it to make sure it meets the standards. I think 
as we look at the breadth of the mapping programs, one of the 
improvements we are doing on the technical side is bringing far 
more visibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Mr. Wright">    There are nearly 1,400 projects going on across the 
country. And ways by which we can see things that are falling 
behind. I want to particularly find ways to understand where is 
there an expectation from the community, particularly, which is 
I believe the instance you are highlighting, the community made 
the investment in the mapping update. Those need to go to the 
front of the line and get processed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hultgren</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Mr. Hultgren"> Yes. That is what is so frustrating, that
they feel like they have done everything they are supposed to 
do and their hands are tied waiting on bureaucracy.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hultgren</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="589" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">Which is just unacceptable. But just wrapping
up, I have less than a minute, as you noted in your testimony, 
FEMA removed the NFIP's financial assistance subsidy 
arrangement with the Write Your Own companies from regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="590" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">You might remember that Chairman Luetkemeyer, Ranking 
Member Cleaver, and I wrote you a letter last year expressing 
some concerns about this decreasing accountability to the 
public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="591" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">Your testimony also states, ``This process was time-
consuming and created a delay to make any administrative 
updates or changes in regulation. Now, the process is 
streamlined to improve the ability for FEMA and its industry 
partners to negotiate operational adjustments and corrections 
more quickly and efficiently.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="592" speaker="Mr. Hultgren">    I agree it is important that we remove red tape and provide 
some flexibility, but operationally, won't Write Your Own 
partners be subject to program changes with potentially little 
or no notice? And how do you plan to transparently communicate 
such changes to these companies that, again, are just trying to 
abide by the rules of the program?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="593" speaker="Mr. Wright">I do think that removing the red tape was
essential. The contract with the companies had been codified 
into regulation and hadn't been changed in 17 years. The 
commitment we made going into this process is that any changes 
will be publicized at least 6 months in advance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="594" speaker="Mr. Wright">I anticipate later this month publishing the arrangement 
that will be in effect October 1st, so more than 6 months' 
notice if a company wanted to make a different business 
decision related to those pieces. And we are consulting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="595" speaker="Mr. Wright">    And so we put out a series of principles. I have tried to 
be transparent with the public as well as the companies about 
where we are going while eliminating the red tape. But there is 
a firm commitment, and frankly, a standard in the regulation 
now. I cannot simply make the decision by fiat on my own.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Hultgren</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="596" speaker="Mr. Hultgren"> My time has expired. I yield back. Thank you,
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="597" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman's time has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="598" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair now recognizes the Chair of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, and a long-term member of this committee, 
the gentleman from California, Mr. Royce, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="599" speaker="Mr. Royce">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="600" speaker="Mr. Royce">    I wanted to ask Mr. Wright a question, sort of a follow-up 
on the chairman's question concerning repetitive loss 
properties.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="601" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="602" speaker="Mr. Royce">I actually have bipartisan legislation with Mr.
Blumenauer from Oregon on this, and one of the things we seek 
to do here is empower communities to tackle this problem. We 
would like to work with you on that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="603" speaker="Mr. Royce">But the precise numbers change from time to time. The 
bottom line seems to be that a small fraction of policies, and 
let's say it is roughly 1 percent of policies, seem to account 
for 20 to 30 percent of the claims and losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="604" speaker="Mr. Royce">In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector 
General said that an increase in new repetitive loss properties 
was outpacing what we were attempting to do in terms of 
mitigation by a factor of 10 to 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="605" speaker="Mr. Royce">    Now, that is a troubling number. Have our mitigation 
programs begin to catch up? Have the numbers turned lately or 
does it look like we are still growing the number of repeat 
loss properties arithmetically here? And can you provide the 
committee with the most up-to-date data on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="606" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I can get back to the committee on the
specifics on the data, and I look forward to the opportunity to 
collaborate with you all as you look at potential legislation. 
The number continues to rise.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="607" speaker="Mr. Royce">Okay. And then the other point I would make is
just taking FEMA's current guidance document on the community 
rating system as it relates to potential homeowners, and I 
think it is pretty cogent here, most prospective buyers do not 
take the time nor do they know how to investigate whether a 
property is subject to a hazard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Mr. Royce">In many cases, a property may not be near a shoreline or a 
stream. Past flooding may have been minor or there may be no 
history of flooding since the area was developed. As a result, 
many people are caught by surprise when the properties are 
flooded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Mr. Royce">    One of the best times to advise someone of a flood hazard 
is when he or she is considering the purchase of that property.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Agreed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Mr. Royce"> So as I understand it, FEMA gives credit to
communities that are able to work with local REALTORS&#4; and the 
community to push this sort of pre-closing flood disclosure.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Mr. Wright"> We do. And we would offer discounts on the
premiums as a result of those activities.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Mr. Royce">And I think that is helpful, but my question is
what more could FEMA do or what more could Congress do to 
ensure that the American people aren't in the dark when it 
comes to flood history?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Mr. Royce">    And won't we improve take-up rates for flood insurance and 
strengthen individual and community mitigation if you better 
inform communities and people about flood risks when they are 
looking at potential properties or developing potential 
properties?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Mr. Wright">This is a conversation that I have a couple of
times a year with the REALTORS&#4; who obviously have become that 
first, that forward-leaning part of this conversation. And we 
have had conversations with some of the private sector app 
developers that we all know well, that provide data on the 
values of homes and what is for sale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I think greater disclosure about the risks on the front 
side are very helpful. Some States require this. Most States do 
not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Mr. Royce"> So there are steps that we could take that
uniformly would assure that there was more knowledge?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I think we would have to look at the
implementation--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Mr. Royce"> For more mitigation presumably?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes. I would want them available. I think when
we push that out, we have to look at the implementation side of 
that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Mr. Royce"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I don't have a relationship with every REALTOR
in the United States, and so I couldn't be the enforcement 
mechanism for that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Mr. Royce"> No, no, I understand that. But as we look at
what different States are doing--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Agreed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Mr. Royce"> --we can get a feedback in terms of what seems
efficient, what seems easy and what is effective in getting to 
this--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Mr. Wright"> And I think there are some things to be
learned--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Mr. Royce"> --solution?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --from your State of California that does have
some responsive requirements related to earthquake risk, 
related to dam safety risk and the like. There are things that 
we learn from there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Mr. Royce"> Yes. Well, thank you, and again, Mr. Wright, I
look forward to working with you on the Earl Blumenauer-Ed 
Royce bill--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="630" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="631" speaker="Mr. Royce"> --that we are moving forward on.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I look forward to collaborating with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Royce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Mr. Royce"> I appreciate it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The Chair would now ask for unanimous consent to allow the 
Chair and the ranking member to each ask one more round of 
questions for 5 minutes each? Without objection? And I would 
guess we may not take that full 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Chairman Duffy">So with that, Mr. Wright, I have to get clarification from 
you because in regard to the mandatory purchase properties and 
the take-up rate, okay, we asked you this very question and 
your liaison responded to Congress and told us that you have no 
knowledge or data on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Chairman Duffy">We asked the OCC and they said they don't have any data on 
this issue. Okay? So you clearly have said I can't advise you, 
Congress, we have no information. To which, the slide that I 
have now put up a second time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The picture that comes at the top of this slide, and it is 
a very nice picture of you. Okay? Right there, great picture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Chairman Duffy">[laughter]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    And here you are giving us different information. So I have 
a slide from FEMA, and I have letters from the NFIP and FEMA 
and they are conflicting. Can you clarify that for me? Do we 
have data on the take-up rate on mandatory purchase properties 
or do we not have data on it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Mr. Wright">First of all, to the degree that my staff or I
have not given you the clearest information, you have my 
apologies. And what I can assert is I am going to get you the 
best data and information that I have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Mr. Wright">I think that sometimes we get caught up on, is it data that 
FEMA collected or did FEMA access it? Frankly, that sets aside. 
You are after an outcome I would imagine, Mr. Chairman, and you 
want to understand why we are not seeing a higher degree of 
take-up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I can collaborate with you on that. I know that the rates 
are different across the country.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Mr. Wright"> And--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Chairman Duffy">That is my concern. And I want to make sure
we are very clear because in the response from your liaisons, 
January 30, 2017, to this very question, the response was, 
``FEMA does not have knowledge on the compliance rate for 
mandatory purchase properties as the managed purchase 
provisions of the law are not under FEMA's purview.'' Okay?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Chairman Duffy">That was the response, and so I then asked the OCC and they 
gave me the same answer. But again, that was the email 
response, but again, the data that was provided in a FEMA 
document says you do have this information and the take-up rate 
is about 50 percent. And if you don't know the answer today, I 
understand that, but we need an answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    Do you know or do you not know? You have to clarify that 
for us. And for everybody else who says we have a take-up rate 
of 50 percent? And we have a $24 billion debt or we are $1.5 
billion short a year? Go for the people who are required to 
purchase that aren't.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Mr. Wright"> You are referencing the 2014 report--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> I am.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --that we did commission--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --and asked for it to be collected. It is not
data that we keep up-to-date. We don't have a tracking element 
for it. I will make sure you have the best information that I 
have, Mr. Chairman, and I, like you, am committed to ensure 
that we have everyone participating who needs to.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> I would just argue that if you don't have
up-to-date data, in your email response to me, you would say I 
do have 2014 data that I can give you, but it is not current.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Sir, to the degree--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> You say I don't collect that data, that is
different than putting a--then we find this slide deck that 
actually shows that this is what you are putting out there. 
That is my rub on how you handled this.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Sir, to the degree that we were not clear in
our transmission of this and the provision of it I apologize, 
and we will make right by it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Chairman Duffy">All right. I would argue that you are not
clear when you have a slide deck giving one data from 2014 and 
then an email that says we don't collect data. So I am pretty 
clear on what you told me, and I think we have to work through 
how we get on the same page.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="659" speaker="Chairman Duffy">I want to switch quickly again--$24.6 billion in debt. On 
average we would say we bring in $3.5 billion in revenue, but 
the cost of the program on average is $5 billion, and we run a 
$1.5 billion deficit a year in the NFIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="660" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    And we are paying 31 percent in compensation for the Write 
Your Owns. Now, I am not passing judgment on that, but is it 
fair to say that is almost $1 billion in compensation for the 
Write Your Owns?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="661" speaker="Mr. Wright">You are right on the amount of compensation.
The Write Your Owns retain a portion of that. And so first of 
all I would tell you I want the price operating this program to 
go down. I want it to go down across-the-board, whether that is 
on my side of the books or what the companies are ultimately 
doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="662" speaker="Mr. Wright">When you look inside that, half of that compensation goes 
to insurance agents, the independent agents who are small 
business owners across the country. And we can begin to walk 
through those elements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="663" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Ultimately, we need to--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="664" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> But it--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="665" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --pay the actual expenses, put the right
incentives in place, and we need to drive down the costs.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="666" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> So just to be clear, this is roughly close
to $1 billion in compensation?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="667" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="668" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> And we roughly run a $1.5 billion deficit a
year. You would agree with that number, too, correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="669" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I would describe the deficit numbers
differently, but I appreciate how you came to those numbers.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="670" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> And again, there is no risk taken on by the
Write Your Owns?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="671" speaker="Mr. Wright"> There is none.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="672" speaker="Chairman Duffy">And did you see any disparity in, because
we have had this conversation and those who are involved in the 
program make the argument that it takes a lot of work to 
educate homebuyers on what the program is and work it up--I get 
that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    But oftentimes, you just have renewals year-over-year and 
there is really no work in that, is there? It's pretty simple 
stuff. And we don't have any distinction between the first year 
the policy is written where there might be a little extra work, 
but also the renewals that take place year-over-year-over-year 
and there is virtually no work.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Mr. Wright"> There are standards of practice in the
insurance industry in terms of how the compensation works. That 
said, we need to drive down the cost. It is we are working--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> That does not--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="676" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Is it--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> --answer my question. A renewal is pretty
darn easy, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Mr. Wright"> A renewal is usually easier than writing a new
policy. That is correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> There are circumstances where it is not?
Well, yes, they would give you one if the maps change and--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Exactly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="681" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Or--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="682" speaker="Mr. Wright"> So when maps change or there has been a change
in rates or surcharges, there can be conversations by which it 
would be more work.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="683" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> And I know it is hard to compare apples-to-
apples in this, but outside of the NFIP, when we look at 
commissions or compensation, I don't know that you are going to 
find the industry paying 30, 31 percent.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="684" speaker="Mr. Wright">I can speak to that. I think that today, and we
have been directed and we are working on the study to move away 
from this, but today we would use the average of five lines, 
including fire, homeowners, allied, and that average comes 
together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="685" speaker="Mr. Wright">    And then today we pay an additional one basis point because 
of the complexity of the Flood Insurance Program. So, 
homeowners sits at 27 percent, and fire sits at 28 percent, 
which shows me there is an opportunity to bring those prices 
down.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Chairman Duffy">And I would just add, this is an important
conversation we should have. It might be fair or it might be 
unfair, but this is a big part of the cost of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    And I think it is important that we engage in the 
conversation, and your 31 percent may be right. And it may be a 
little too high.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Mr. Wright"> So I think--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="689" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> That is a--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="690" speaker="Mr. Wright"> --my position is clear. I do think we can bring
those costs down. We need to look at them in terms of the Write 
Your Owns. We need to look at it also in terms of the agents 
and also the fact that at least 2.4 percent basis points of 
that go to State taxes that just flow back through to the 
States.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Chairman Duffy">Absolutely. And we know the agents do great
work in our communities, making sure these programs and these 
policies get out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    With that, my time is well over, and I now recognize the 
ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Cleaver, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="693" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="694" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">    Mr. Wright, I just returned. I missed votes all week. I 
have been in my district because we were hit by tornadoes--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="696" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">--in small towns you have never heard of, Oak
Grove, Richmond. We had a tornado hit Orrick, a great vacation 
spot if you are looking for a place to visit this summer. But 
the problem is that we have this threshold that you have to 
reach of $8 million in damage in order to get help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="697" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">So we are, unintentionally but for sure, hurting small 
communities because Orrick has 800 homes in the whole town. And 
so if all of them had been destroyed, we still wouldn't have 
reached that threshold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="698" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">    The same thing happened in Richmond, population 5,000, and 
Oak Grove, population 7,700. Do you think that is something 
that needs to be changed?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Mr. Cleaver, those standards are set in terms
of how FEMA implements the Stafford Act and there are per 
capita standards that are in place. I am not an expert on those 
various thresholds, but I would be happy to get the right folks 
talking with you about them.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="700" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">Okay. Because the people there think, we live
in a small town. No matter what happens to us, we don't get 
help. But I would be happy to get that information because I am 
going back up there Sunday and many people are just interested 
in well, why is it that we can't get help?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="701" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">I live in a small town, so, a small town never gets kicked. 
And you have to live in the urban area before you get help from 
your own government. So I would be very, very interested in 
information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">The other thing that I am a little concerned about, and it 
is tornado season so I hope there are no more tornadoes in the 
country. That is a hope, but I don't think I am going to be 
able to stop that with the hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">And so we are going to end up before spring is over having 
some more tornadoes. Hopefully, they won't be devastating to 
the point where lives are lost, but they are going to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Mr. Cleaver">    With that in mind, and with the OMB slashing or proposing 
to slash the FEMA budget by 11 percent, if that should happen, 
does that mean that my people in my small towns have less of a 
chance to get help?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Sir, I can't speak to the specifics of the
budget that is still under formulation. What I will tell you is 
the disaster relief fund is where we pay these expenses to 
communities, and we can walk you through more of those details 
when we show you the elements related to the standards for 
review on declarations.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="706" speaker="Mr. Cleaver"> Okay. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="707" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> The Chair recognizes that the gentleman
from California has now arrived, and recognizes him for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="708" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Thank you. Yesterday, it was reported in the
Washington Post that the Trump Administration may slash FEMA's 
budget in part to help find funds for other priorities. It was 
reported that homeowners may face a surcharge on their flood 
insurance policies, and I guess that would be to make up for 
the lost revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="709" speaker="Mr. Sherman">    What impact would these cuts have on your ability to 
properly administer the flood insurance program? Can you 
elaborate on the flood fee, and what kind of surcharge we are 
talking about?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="710" speaker="Mr. Wright">Sir, I am aware of the reporting that you are
referencing. What I can tell you is that to the best of my 
knowledge, the final decisions related to the President's 
budget haven't been made. So it would be premature for me to 
speak about specifics. I would refer you to the Office of 
Management and Budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="711" speaker="Mr. Wright">    Once that proposal is available, I would be happy to 
discuss how it would be implemented in our programs with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="712" speaker="Mr. Sherman"> But obviously if the budget is cut, homeowners
will be paying more, correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="713" speaker="Mr. Wright"> The related elements that are here deal with
when are there fees that are in place and surcharges and who 
bears the costs of those elements? Again, I don't know that I 
can speak to the specifics of that until I know what the 
proposal says.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="714" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Last Congress, the House passed the Flood
Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act (FIMPMA) 
unanimously. Although it did not receive a vote in the Senate, 
the bill had bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="715" speaker="Mr. Sherman">As you will recall, the bill clarified the provision in the 
Biggert-Waters 2012 Act allowing for private flood policies to 
meet mandatory purchase requrements of the flood insurance 
program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="716" speaker="Mr. Sherman">Because there is some confusion that remains for insurers 
and lenders causing the market to be slow in responding, the 
FIMPMA would clarify this provision. In addition to some 
suggestions for growing private insurance options, including 
the removal of the non-compete clause from the WYO arrangement 
and granting access to the NFIP's claim to loss data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="717" speaker="Mr. Sherman">    What is your opinion of this proposal? Do you agree with 
the 419 Members of the House who voted for it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="718" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I believe that the bill has important elements
in it, particularly as we bring clarity onto what satisfies 
comparable coverage. And I think that we look forward to 
working with the committee and its members on what that 
provision would look like in this new Congress.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="719" speaker="Mr. Sherman"> What would the future of the NFIP look like if
perhaps as many as 80 percent of the current policyholders, 
those with moderate or low risk, are recruited away by the 
private flood carriers? What effect would that have?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="720" speaker="Mr. Wright">Far less than 80 percent of our book of
business is low or moderate. I do believe to the degree the 
private market comes in, that would be an obvious place for 
them to start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="721" speaker="Mr. Wright">So today of my 5.1 million policies, 1.6 million of those 
are preferred risk policies. Given the assertion you have made, 
that might be a place where they would begin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="722" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I am convinced, and this goes to the chairman's earlier 
point about there are far more structures that need to be 
insured. And so I am convinced a mutual gain approach is the 
right way on here. And I think making space and encouraging the 
private markets is a helpful way to ensure that more people are 
covered for flood in this country.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="723" speaker="Mr. Sherman"> You noted that FEMA wants to see flood
insurance private or public increasing as we move forward. 
Could you explain some more on what steps Congress can take so 
more people are insured?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="724" speaker="Mr. Wright">I think there are particularly some
programmatic and technical issues that are barriers for us to 
giving folks the product that they want or need. It requires us 
to look at the coverage limits. It also requires us to look at 
things like basements and the like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="725" speaker="Mr. Wright">Today, the statute mandates that I put the terms and 
conditions of the policy into the Code of Federal Regulations, 
which is a very cumbersome process. My agency is very slow to 
do rulemaking, and so in making these changes, I think one of 
the elements I would assert to you is that it still should go 
through notice and comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="726" speaker="Mr. Wright">    I should still be very transparent about it, but the idea 
that I go through a full regulatory rulemaking to add a 
coverage for someone that they are willing to pay for at an 
actuarial rate, those are the kind of barriers that Congress 
could help us remove.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Sherman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="727" speaker="Mr. Sherman">I am hoping you will propose statutory
language so that we understand what we can do to be helpful and 
are very specific about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="728" speaker="Mr. Sherman">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="729" speaker="Mr. Wright"> I would be happy to work with you on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="730" speaker="Chairman Duffy">The gentlemen yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="731" speaker="Chairman Duffy">    The Chair has spoken with the ranking member and asks 
unanimous consent to allow the gentleman from New Jersey 5 
additional minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Cleaver</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="732" speaker="Mr. Cleaver"> No objection.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman Duffy</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="733" speaker="Chairman Duffy"> Without objection, it is so ordered. The
gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="734" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Ranking
Member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="735" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">I want to just follow up a little bit on what we talked 
about before. Mr. Wright, you and I have some things in common. 
I think you know that I spent my business career in insurance, 
a business I love very much, which I think can do an awful lot 
of good for people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="736" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">I noticed in my business life that as things got bigger, 
you have to manage them differently. And so when I had a small 
company, it was one thing. When I had thousands of people, it 
was very different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="737" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">And often when you are trying to understand how things are 
going wrong, you only see the ripples at the top where the 
causation is really beneath the water line. And it is not easy 
to get to the bottom of things sometimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="738" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">I am trying to understand something you talked about a bit 
earlier. The Write Your Owns had zero incentive to underpay 
claims. In fact, you might argue they had an incentive to pay 
them quickly because they don't make more money by creating a 
tortuous process. And yet, claims got delayed and there were 
some pretty egregious errors made, some of them apparently 
intentionally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="739" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">You testified that the engineers and the adjusters would 
have no financial incentive to change a report to say something 
was covered by flood and then a few weeks later send it to the 
insured with a denial and say it wasn't covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="740" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">    Are you aware of any action within either the NFIP or FEMA 
more broadly, any action either explicit or implicit, implied--
are you aware of anything that came out of NFIP or FEMA, either 
verbally or in writing that would have suggested to various 
Write Your Own companies, various engineers and adjusters, that 
you wanted them to reduce claim payments?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="741" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Sir, as you well know and we have discussed, it
precedes me, but I have gone back and I have had the team 
looking at this question. And I have seen no evidence of that 
instruction being provided.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="742" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"> Does it strike you as just incongruous that
this could have happened this way without somebody directing 
it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="743" speaker="Mr. Wright">The best I have been able to understand, is we
have looked through this: 19,000 of these claims came back for 
reconsideration as we have moved through, and as you addressed. 
I was brought in to finish fixing this given the problems that 
were in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="744" speaker="Mr. Wright">A few things have been made clear to me, and I have spent a 
lot of time with some of the files myself looking at them, 
including some of the ones with errors in them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="745" speaker="Mr. Wright">What I saw was a system that was overwhelmed without the 
right controls in place. I saw a lot of sloppiness. That is 
inexcusable, and we have to have the controls in place to be 
able to see that and correct it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="746" speaker="Mr. Wright">When you have a size event as large as this one, you are 
not going to play perfect ball. But we have to make sure that 
we do that and so some of the changes I made, we changed the 
appeals process because when people didn't think they got a 
fair shake on it, they couldn't win through that appeals 
process. That is changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="747" speaker="Mr. Wright">    The litigation oversight, the companies were fighting the 
wrong battles on this. But more fundamentally I have to get to 
the point by which we are not seeing changes made that are 
except to improve the quality of the reports.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="748" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">That is what I will be looking for. And I
don't doubt your motives and your good intentions about fixing 
it, but we have to see something different in the actual 
structure of NFIP the next time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="749" speaker="Mr. MacArthur">    Actually, I only have a minute left, and I want to change 
gears--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="750" speaker="Mr. Wright"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MacArthur</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="751" speaker="Mr. MacArthur"> --for a moment. ICC coverage, we have talked
about a little bit today. And I just want to ask you, assuming 
actuarial adequacy, do you believe that increasing ICC limits 
and increasing the actual payment of ICC funds would result in 
avoidance of future losses?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Wright</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="752" speaker="Mr. Wright">It would help mitigate future losses. For me,
the key is finding out how to do it where--today it is $30,000. 
Structures in your district largely are well in excess of a 
half million. I know it is a diverse place, but there are high 
property values. There are other parts of the country where the 
property values are only $100,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="753" speaker="Mr. Wright">We have to find the right way to tie that coverage or mini-
grant program to the structure in a way that understands it, 
and then come to an understanding today we run a mini-grant 
program that has helped to defray the cost of that increased 
cost of compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="754" speaker="Mr. Wright">Are we trying to actually stand up something that provides 
you full coverage, at which point we should price it and we
