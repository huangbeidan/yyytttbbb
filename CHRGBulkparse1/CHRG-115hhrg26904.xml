    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <option>Subcommittee on Counterterrorism Intelligence will come to</option>
    <option>order.
    The subcommittee is meeting today to hear testimony from 
four counterterrorism and homeland security experts. I would 
like to welcome the Members of the subcommittee, particularly 
Ranking Member Kathleen Rice, and express my appreciation to 
witnesses who traveled to be here today.
    Now I recognize myself for an opening statement.
    In the weeks and months after the terror attacks of 
September 11, Congress and the administration worked together 
to fix the weaknesses which our enemies exploited to carry out 
their attacks. We created the Department of Homeland Security, 
restructured the intelligence community, and launched a war on 
terror to take the fight to our enemy, all to ensure that a 
similar attack would not happen again.
    In the years that followed, however, much of the energy 
behind these reforms has been lost. Budgets were cut and 
important legislative initiatives were delayed. By 2013, 
leaders in National security warned that the country was 
paralyzed with, ``terror fatigue.''
    At the same time, the al-Qaeda network evolved and 
metastasized and spread and ISIS began to take root, hundreds 
of Americans have been radicalized. A year ago, senior National 
security leaders testified that the United States is facing its 
highest threat level since 9/11.
    Few could have predicted in 2001 how the world would change 
over the next 16 years. There has yet to be another spectacular 
attack claiming thousands of lives, due largely to the heroes 
in the ranks of our intelligence community, armed forces, first 
responders, and law enforcement and vigilant citizens.
    As Commissioner Davis well knows, the increase in other 
attacks, though, across the United States carried out by 
adherents to the global jihadist ideology and the rapid 
revolution of terrorist tactics reveal that our enemy has 
changed with the times.
    We must prepare for even more change: Increased pressure on 
terror cell safe havens and the caliphate in Syria may result 
in a new terrorist diaspora as thousands leave the conflict 
zone. Our adversaries, including a newly emboldened Iran, will 
continue to exploit any available chaos.
    As the new administration settles in, there is no doubt 
that we are at a crossroads in U.S. counterterrorism strategy. 
We must have an aggressive, long-term strategy for addressing 
Islamic terrorist threat abroad and in the homeland.
    For years, this committee has worked hard to identify and 
eliminate weaknesses in U.S. security defenses. Professionals 
and experts have warned repeatedly about failures to connect 
the dots and share information between agencies. After-action 
reviews of various terror attacks have identified individual 
and systemic failures that remain unaddressed.
    We have an opportunity to carefully improve the homeland 
security of the United States. To whatever extent possible, 
this must include bipartisan cooperation and an eye on the 
vital issue of the safety and security for Americans. It is 
absolutely necessary to make progress as our adversaries will 
only continue to evolve.
    This hearing today provides our first step. To build on the 
foundation of our work in previous Congresses, the witnesses 
here today will offer perspectives on both the current homeland 
threat picture and how Congress working with the administration 
can fight to once again fix the weaknesses our enemies now 
exploit. I look forward to hearing your suggestions to where 
improvements can be made across our counterterrorism programs 
and policies.
    [The statement of Chairman King follows:]
                  Statement of Chairman Peter T. King
                           February 28, 2017

2001, Congress and the administration worked together to fix the

the next 16 years. There has yet to be another spectacular attack 
claiming thousands of lives--due largely to the heroes in the ranks of 
our intelligence community, armed forces, first responders and law 
enforcement, and vigilant citizens. Nonetheless, the increase of small-
scale attacks across the United States carried out by adherents to the 
global jihadist ideology and the rapid evolution of terrorist tactics 
reveal that our enemy has changed with the times. We must prepare for 
even more change: Increased pressure on terror safe havens and the 
``caliphate'' in Syria may result in a new terrorist diaspora as 
thousands leave the conflict zone. Our adversaries--including a newly 
emboldened Iran--will continue to exploit any available chaos.
    As the new administration settles in, there is no doubt that we are

threat abroad and in the homeland.
    For years, this committee has worked hard to identify and eliminate

warned repeatedly about failures to connect the dots and share 
information between agencies. After-action reviews of various terrorist 
attacks have identified individual and systemic failures that remain 
unaddressed.
    We have an opportunity to carefully, but considerably, improve the 
homeland security of the United States. To whatever extent possible, 
this must include bipartisan cooperation and an eye on the vital issue 
of the safety and security of Americans. It is absolutely necessary to 
make progress, as our adversaries will only continue to evolve.
    This hearing provides us our first step. To build on the foundation

Congress, working with this administration, can fight to once again fix

counterterrorism programs and policies.
    Mr. King. Now I recognize the Ranking Member, Miss Rice.
    Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding today's 
hearing.
    I want to thank the witnesses for their testimony today.
    As we examine the future of counterterrorism, I think it is 
important to step back and consider just how much the threat of 
terrorism has evolved in the past 10 or 20 years. Terrorists 
today are not leaving our borders, undergoing training in 
another country and returning to the United States to commit 
attacks. Terrorists no longer need to seek financing from 
terrorist organizations, nor do these individuals need the plan 
or permission of a terrorist group or a particular leader.
    More and more terrorists can be inspired by propaganda and 
rhetoric spewed over the internet. Lone actors, people who are 
self-radicalized and may not appear on a particular watch list 
to be flagged at the border, present an especially difficult 
task for our law enforcement officials. But the internet is not 
the only avenue to radicalization.
    Charged public rhetoric can be a factor, including from our 
own President. We have heard reports that ISIS refers to 
President Trump's travel ban as the blessed ban. They point to 
the ban as proof that the United States is at war with Islam 
and the Muslim world.
    I think it is important to recognize that words matter, 
particularly when we have a group like ISIS with such 
sophisticated communications operations. The words we use do 
matter; calling for a complete and total ban on Muslims 
entering the United States or going out of your way to call it 
radical Islamic terrorism, those words play right into our 
enemies' hands and do nothing to help our counterterrorism 
efforts.
    Additionally, I am particularly concerned right now about 
the recent wave of bomb threats made Nation-wide to Jewish 
community centers, or JCCs. Last week, I joined several Members 
of Congress in urging the Department of Homeland Security, the 
Department of Justice, and the FBI to fully investigate these 
threats.
    Over the last 2 decades, JCCs and Jewish institutions have 
several times been the target of domestic terrorist attacks. We 
must do more to protect these and similar social, recreational, 
and cultural facilities.
    To that end, I would ask Chairman King that this 
subcommittee commit to examining the work of DHS and FBI to 
help protect and harden JCCs and other religious institutions 
from terrorist threats. The threat landscape is ever-evolving 
and we have a responsibility to evolve with it and to confront 
the threat of terrorism in all its forms.
    I look forward to hearing from our expert witnesses today, 
and I hope this will be a constructive conversation.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [The statement of Ranking Member Rice follows:]
              Statement of Ranking Member Kathleen M. Rice

    Mr. King. Thank you, Miss Rice. Obviously we would be, you 
know, delighted to work with you on this. I know over the 
years, especially the Jewish community in New York I can speak 
of personally, has received extensive homeland security funding 
and training and briefing on how to harden their targets and 
protect themselves. Obviously, if more has to be done, we will 
do it. It is really essential.
    Again, coming from New York, we are probably even more 
particularly aware of, you know, the nature of those threats. 
So thank you, and I look forward to working with you that.
    Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening 
statements may be submitted for the record.
    [The statements of Ranking Member Thompson and Honorable 
Jackson Lee follow:]
             Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
                           February 28, 2017
    Today, we will hear about what can be done to effectively counter 
ISIL, al-Qaeda, sovereign citizens, and other terrorist organizations. 
Through improved intelligence and effective allegiances, we have come a 
long way as a Nation since September 11.
    However, just a little over a month into the Trump administration, 
the President, through his ill-conceived and hasty U.S. 
counterterrorism policies seeks to weaken counterterrorism defenses 
built over the 16 years since 9/11.
    For example, on January 27, President Trump used unilateral 
Presidential power to circumvent Congress and defied our Constitution 
by issuing an Executive Order based on stereotyping, fear-mongering, 
and bigotry. This careless Executive Order and President Trump's 
inflammatory rhetoric used throughout his campaign and during his 
presidency provides propaganda for terrorist networks and alienates our 
allies within the United States and abroad.
    While the Trump administration continues to advance policies that 
do nothing to make this country safer, and those in Congress defend 
these policies, questions still remain about one of the largest 
counterterrorism issues before our country.
    We have no more answers regarding President Trump and this 
administration's continuous entanglement with the Vladamir Putin 
Regime. In fact, we have more questions now than then because we know 
that President Trump's former National security advisor lied about his 
communications with the Putin regime. I am disappointed that 
Republicans in Congress are unwilling to acknowledge that this 
significantly impacts our National security.
    I have said it several times and I will continue, we need an 
independent commission to fully investigate Russia's interference with 
the election and any potential Trump campaign ties to Putin and his 
policies. Congress and the American public must be assured that our 
leaders have their best interests in mind when creating policy, 
especially and including our counterterrorism policies, not the best 
interests of foreign nations and their leaders.

                           February 28, 2017
    Chairman Peter King and Ranking Member Kathleen Rice, the topic of 
today's subcommittee hearing is ``The Future of Counterterrorism: 
Addressing the Evolving Threat to Domestic Security.''
    I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Edward Davis, former police commissioner of the city of 
        Boston;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Robin Simcox, Margaret Thatcher fellow, Margaret Thatcher 
        Center for Freedom, Heritage Foundation;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Thomas Joscelyn, senior fellow, Foundation for Defense 
        Democracies; and
  &lt;bullet&gt; Peter Bergen, vice president and director, international 
        security, future of war, and fellows programs, New America 
        (Democratic witness).
    As a senior Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and 
Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and 
Homeland Security this topic has significance due to the number of 
violent acts committed in the United States since November 2016 number 
over 1,000.
    According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), in the 
immediate aftermath of Election Day, a wave of hate crimes and lesser 
hate incidents swept the country--1,094 bias incidents in the first 34 
days following November 8, 2016.
    SPLC reports that anti-immigrant incidents (315) remain the most 
reported, followed by anti-black (221), anti-Muslim (112), and anti-
LGBT (109). Anti-Trump incidents numbered 26 (6 of which were also 
anti-white in nature, with 2 non-Trump related anti-white incidents 
reported).
    The purpose of this hearing is to receive testimony from the 
witnesses about efforts to examine the continued evolution of the 
terrorist threat and review policy changes that will further the 
homeland security and counterterrorism programs and policies of the 
United States.
    Unfortunately, ill-conceived U.S. counterterrorism policy under the 
Trump administration has and will likely continue to weaken the 
defenses built over the 16 years since 9/11.
    In the month since taking office, carelessly-created Executive 
Orders such as the Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry 
into the United States Executive Order and inflammatory rhetoric has 
provided propaganda for terrorist networks and alienated our allies 
within the United States and abroad.
    We can focus our efforts on a range of topics that impact homeland 
security, but we should not ignore how policies and public acts by 
individuals can contribute to the threat of home-grown terrorists or 
lone wolves as well as contribute to the recruitment efforts of ISIL, 
al-Qaeda, or other terrorist groups.
    There seems to be an implied if not expressed belief that violent 
acts carried out against certain persons living within the United 
States can be carried out without fear of a Justice Department led by 
Jeff Sessions or a White House with senior staff known to hold bias 
views towards minorities, immigrants, and others.
    Just last week, two Indian citizens who were enjoying a college 
basketball game with a friend were murdered.
    I want to offer my condolences to the family of Srinivas 
Kuchibhotla and my prayers for a speedy recovery for Alok Madasani who 
were brutally shot in Kansas City Kansas, and senselessly gunned down 
by an angry racist.
             recent terrorist attacks in the united states
    On November 28, 2016, 11 individuals were injured in an incident at 
Ohio State University when Abdul Razaq Ali Artan drove a car into a 
crowd and also wounded individuals with a knife.
    On July 17, 2016, an offender shot and killed six police officers 
in Baton Rouge, LA. Three of the officers died and three were 
hospitalized.
    On July 7, 2016, an offender shot and killed five police officers 
and wounded 11 others (9 police officers and two civilians) in Dallas, 
TX. The offender was killed by police with a remotely-guided robot 
loaded with an explosive.
    On June 12, 2016, an armed assailant shot and killed 49 people and 
non-fatally wounded over 50 others in an Orlando, FL nightclub. After a 
3-hour stand-off with police, the assailant was killed by police.
    On December 2, 2015, two offenders killed 14 people and wounded 21 
others in San Bernardino, CA at a social services center. Both 
offenders were killed by police while resisting arrest.
    On November 27, 2015, at a Planned Parenthood clinic, in Colorado 
Springs, CO, a lone offender shot and killed three people and wounded 
another nine people with a semiautomatic rifle before surrendering to 
the Police after a 5-hour stand-off.
    On July 16, 2015, in Chattanooga, TN, a lone offender killed five 
people and wounded another person at a military recruitment office and 
naval reserve center, before he was killed by police.
    On June 17, 2015, in Charleston, SC, a lone offender shot and 
killed nine parishioners and wounded another parishioner with 45 
caliber pistol at the historic Emanuel American Methodist Episcopal 
Church.
    The climate that the Nation is in at this moment poses the greatest 
threat to Homeland Security than at any other time since the days 
following September 11, 2001.
    Words matter as well as actions--we need diplomacy and a strong 
homeland security plan bolstered by a military that can come to the 
fore if peaceful efforts to resolve disputes fail.
    The United States cannot make more enemies than we are making 
friends--we cannot afford to turn our friends into enemies or absent 
allies when we need them to fight terrorist threats.
    I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses.
    Thank you.
    Mr. King. We are very pleased to have a distinguished panel 
of witnesses today on this important topic. All you have 
testified here before, and I want to thank Ed Davis, Tom 
Joscelyn, Robin Simcox, and Peter Bergen for once again 
returning.
    Our first witness is Commissioner Davis. Ed Davis is the 
president and CEO of Edward Davis LLC, a business strategy and 
securities firm. He has a 35-year career in law enforcement, 
including serving for 7 years as the police commissioner of the 
city of Boston. Prior to that, he served as superintendent of 
the Lowell, Massachusetts police department where he spent 
nearly 30 years. Commissioner Davis has consistently been a 
strong advocate for interagency collaboration and public 
safety. He has been a friend and trusted adviser to this 
committee for a number of years.
    I believe you testified within 1 or 2 months of the attacks 
at the Boston Marathon. It was very moving and, more than that, 
very poignant testimony detailing deficiencies that were there 
and how you are working to correct them, particularly in your 
dealings with the FBI. You have been a great source of 
information to Members on both sides of the aisle, and you have 
come back time again. I want to thank you for that.
    So with that, I recognized former Commissioner Ed Davis--
always be commissioner--Commissioner Davis for his testimony.

    <opening>STATEMENT OF EDWARD F. DAVIS, III, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="EDWARD F. DAVIS">Good morning. The Committee on Homeland Security</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="EDWARD F. DAVIS">                       EDWARD DAVIS, LLC
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Davis">Thank you for the opportunity to speak before
you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Davis">As I stated in my 2013 testimony before the Senate 
Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, this 
topic is critically important and must remain a top priority 
for Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Davis">Our administration, Congress, law enforcement, and private 
citizens must continue to work together in a coordinated 
manner. A focus on communication and consistency of funding for 
multi-jurisdictional training drills, communication tools, and 
intelligence gathering is essential to prevention and 
mitigation in the event of an organized or lone-wolf attack 
domestically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Davis">Organized and lone-wolf attacks are not going away any time 
soon. These individuals are nimble and frequently change their 
methods. The goals, however, remain the same: Death, 
destruction, creation of fear and chaos. Just in 2016, we saw 
the brutal shooting and explosive attack on the Brussels 
national airport in Belgium that killed 32 civilians and three 
of the terrorists. A large truck plowing people down following 
the Bastille Day celebration in Nice, France that killed 86 
people. Different methods, same goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Davis">More than ever before, relationships between law 
enforcement partners, stakeholders, and community members needs 
to be in place to prevent attacks. Law enforcement needs 
sufficient police resources and updated intelligence to collect 
relevant information prior to attacks and to truly begin to 
build trust within all of our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Davis">Following the attacks on September 11, counterterrorism 
efforts in the United States shifted to the prevention of the 
next domestic terror attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Davis">JTTF, Joint Terrorism Task Forces, already in place at that 
time, established a working partnership with local, State, and 
Federal law enforcement authorities. At the time of the 
marathon bombing, there were information-sharing issues that 
were subsequently changed and improved. These JTTFs have proven 
to be a tremendous vehicle encouraging local, Federal, and 
State police to work together as full partners toward our 
Nation's critical mission of protecting the U.S. homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Davis">I am happy to report that in Boston, under the direction of 
SAC, Hank Shaw, the JTTF has been working better than ever. The 
changes that were put in after testimony at the Homeland 
Security Committee in 2013 remain in place today and are 
working very well in the city of Boston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Davis">Testing of the JTTF systems is important for effectiveness 
and transparency, however. Every JTTF should be audited at 
appropriate intervals by the Department of Justice. The audit 
should include the content of every memorandum of understanding 
between agencies to ensure it is staying current with the ever-
changing nature of the attacks, the type of investigations 
included in the databases and the actual sharing of information 
processes among JTTF members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Davis">If you are to be successful in combating terrorism, law 
enforcement, cities and towns, and our Government must be 
communicating, sharing information, improving intelligence, and 
coordinating our prevention and response efforts. In 2013, 
following the bombings at the Boston marathon, Federal agents 
worked side-by-side with local law enforcement officers, 
collecting evidence at the finish line, interviewing witnesses 
and suspects, combing through petabytes of data from cellular 
service providers, and poring over the all-important collection 
of images from fixed surveillance and civilian cameras.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Davis">The decision to crowdsource, to go to the internet for help 
from citizens for potential evidence was made jointly by 
Federal, State, and local authorities. This collaboration, both 
in the field and behind the scenes, resulted in both suspects 
being arrested or killed within 102 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Davis">Communities have a vital role in the prevention of attacks. 
I have investigated transnational organized crime throughout 
the majority of my career. I can tell you that after 35 years 
of policing, criminals or bad actors are always a small 
percentage of the population they live within.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Davis">It is impossible to work these cases without building 
strong, cooperative, and trusting relationships with the many 
good people within that same population. That is true whether 
you are doing narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, or 
terrorist investigations, those who are often most vulnerable 
to the threats of these depraved actors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Davis">When I was commissioner of the Boston police department, we 
hosted and participated in the Bridges Group. It is a 
collaborative effort among various community representatives, 
Federal, State, and local government agencies and it is 
designed to enhance safety and security and provide an 
opportunity for candid conversation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Davis">At that time, the Boston police department was experiencing 
an uptick in violence involving young Somali men. The Somali 
group representatives that participated in the Bridges meeting 
stepped in, they remediated the situation through community 
council, activities, and job creation in coordination with the 
Boston police department, and that problem went away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Davis">The communities of every city and town across the United 
States have the ability to play a central role in the 
prevention of organized and lone-wolf attacks. Citizens can, if 
properly informed and trusting, provide early information to 
law enforcement agencies on radicalization in their midst.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Davis">One of the marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had a 
concerning outburst indicative of potential radicalization at 
the Cambridge mosque prior to the attacks. No information 
regarding the incident was provided to Federal, State, or local 
authorities. This was a missed opportunity to intervene. It 
would have led to greater scrutiny of the Tsarnaevs before the 
bombs exploded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Davis">This requires, however, consistent effort to build trust 
and strong relationships. Intelligence sharing has been 
improved through the fusion centers located across the country, 
more effective JTTFs, and improved technology. One of the best 
practices in Boston is a comprehensive review of the JTTF 
cases. This is done several times a year and always prior to a 
major event. This process has provided more focused follow-up 
on individuals who pose the greatest threat to citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Davis">I have more written testimony, but I don't want to go over 
my time here. So I just will sum up by saying that by working 
together, by training, preparing, and planning for these events 
and, most importantly, by developing the intelligence needed to 
intervene, like we saw in the attack on the police in Boston a 
year ago where a terrorist was being monitored and said he was 
going to go kill a police officer and behead a police officer, 
there was immediate intervention that occurred that stopped 
that attack from happening. That makes all the difference.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Davis ">Thank you.</paragraph>

committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak before you today. 
This topic is critically important and must remain a top priority for 
Congress. Our administration, Congress, law enforcement, and private 
citizens must continue to work together in a coordinated manner. A 
focus on communication and consistency of funding for multi-
jurisdictional training drills, communication tools, and intelligence 
gathering is essential to prevention and mitigation in the event of an 
organized or lone-wolf attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Davis ">The nature of the work I do with my security consulting firm keeps 
me in touch with National and international front-line police and law 
enforcement agencies. Organized and lone-wolf attacks are not going 
away any time soon. These individuals are nimble and frequently change 
their methods. The goals, however, remain the same: Death, destruction, 
creation of fear and chaos. In 2016 we saw a brutal shooting and 
explosive attack on the Brussels National Airport in Belgium that 
killed 32 civilians and 3 of the perpetrators; a large truck plowing

    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Davis ">Testing of the JTTF system is important for effectiveness and

charged with such responsibility must be monitored for compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Davis ">If we are to be successful in combating terrorism, law enforcement,

Tamerlan Tsarnaev had a concerning outburst, indicative of potential

Imam quoted Martin Luther King, Jr. No information regarding this 
incident was provided to Federal, State, or local authorities. This was 
a missed opportunity for information that could have led to greater 
scrutiny of Tsarnaev before the bombs exploded. This requires 
consistent effort to build trust and strong relationships between law 
enforcement and the community, so this type of information becomes 
available in a timely manner.</paragraph>

always prior to a major event. This process has provided more focused 
follow-up on individuals who pose the greatest threat to citizens and 
visitors in Boston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Davis ">It is important for Congress to remain vigilant on information 
sharing while at the same time safeguarding all citizens' important 
Constitutional rights. The JTTFs rely on information from sources other 
than the Federal authorities. The New York Police Department 
intelligence operations provides the most effective and timeliest 
information sharing to JTTFs. The approval process for the Federal 
information sharing system is slower and is still largely bureaucratic. 
I encourage you to find ways to streamline and expedite this system so 
that information can be shared with appropriate partners in a timely 
manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Davis ">Law enforcement training is essential for effective prevention, 
mitigation, and response to terrorist attacks. I encourage all of you 
to continue to push for important funding such as Urban Area Security 
Initiative (UASI) through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In 
May, 2011, the Boston Police Department, city of Boston agencies, 
Federal, State, local, and transit law enforcement partners, emergency 
medical community, and other key stakeholders all trained together in a 
Mumbai scenario Urban Shield: Boston exercise. It revealed deficiencies 
that no doubt saved lives in April, 2013. It became clear that police 
and other first responders radios were not synced and that the medical 
and law enforcement community did not share common, necessary protocols 
in the event of an attack. When all cell phones failed during the 
Marathon attacks, radios were critical for communication. Each of the 
above deficiencies, and more, were corrected immediately and in place 
for the Marathon attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Davis ">Training also offers best practices for prevention, mitigation, and 
response such as how to secure perimeters. The use of large trucks, 
particularly heavy dump trucks, around the perimeter of large crowd 
events is one example of various methods used by law enforcement. This 
is done regularly during Boston championship events. In New Orleans 
last week, the drunk driver of a vehicle that plowed into a crowd, 
critically injuring approximately 28 people, eventually crashed into a 
dump truck that was situated along his travel route for cleaning 
purposes. This stop-gap definitely saved lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Davis ">I recently spoke with the director of security for the Brussels 
National Airport in Zaventem, Belgium. At the time of the recent 
attack, law enforcement and security cell phones and radios were not 
functioning. They actually had to rely on a centuries-old model of 
using human runners with written messages to bring and receive 
information. This is an excellent example of why appropriate 
communication networks and equipment must be readily available so that 
law enforcement can do their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Davis ">Public safety agencies must be able to effectively communicate at 
all times, particularly during a crisis. I encourage you to support 
interoperable networks that will facilitate interagency communication 
through funding and legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Davis ">    In closing, the evolving and changing challenge of terrorism today 
in our country and throughout the world requires daily attention and 
consistent commitment from our leaders in both policy and funding. If 
we are to make measurable progress in this fight, it requires a common-
sense approach: A true intelligence-sharing system that is periodically 
checked for effectiveness and authenticity, coordinated training for 
first responders and key stakeholders, critical equipment for first 
responders, long-term planning for communication networks, and 
relationship building with each of our communities. I ask that you 
continue to find legislative methods to enhance the great work that is 
already being done by our law enforcement community, and fund important 
programs that increase knowledge, training, and provide the right tools 
to effectively get the job done. Thank you.

    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. King">Thank you, Commissioner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. King">Our next witness is Tom Joscelyn, who also has appeared 
before this committee a number of times. Mr. Joscelyn is a 
senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies 
and is senior editor of its Long War Journal, a widely-read 
publication tracking counterterrorism operations and terror 
threats. Much of his research focuses on how al-Qaeda and ISIS 
operate around the globe. He served as a trainer for the FBI's 
Counterterrorism Division and is a very regular face in the 
halls of Congress having testified more than a dozen times.</paragraph>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF THOMAS JOSCELYN, SENIOR FELLOW, THE FOUNDATION FORTHE DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THOMAS JOSCELYN">    Mr. Joscelyn, you are recognized for your testimony and 
thanks for being back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Thank you, Congressman, for the introduction
and thank you all for being here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Unfortunately, I have had to testify more than a dozen 
times. As I say often to my wife, this has been somewhat of a 
growth industry over the years, I wish it wasn't. I would very 
much like to go back into economics and finance at any time, 
but I find myself here again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">The truth of the matter is, in my written testimony I sort-
of look at different levels of threats to domestic security. 
One of the levels of threat is sort of what we call inspired 
attacks or something along those lines, often called lone 
wolves. I don't term them that way. I term them as individual 
terrorists or individual attackers because if they are 
responding to a global ideological movement and are taking up 
that call, then in fact they actually at least have an 
ideological bond to the people who are trying to attack us and 
to professional organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">But beyond that, if you look at my written testimony, I 
include somewhere between 8 and 10 or 11 examples of a 
different phenomenon that ISIS has taken to another level 
inside Europe and the United States. It is this phenomenon 
called remote-controlled attacks. This is something they have 
had some success, these are small-scale operations. These are 
operations where a digital handler, a virtual handler for ISIS, 
sits in Raqqah, Syria, or somewhere outside of Mosul, Iraq, and 
via social media applications is able to communicate with 
would-be recruits in the West or elsewhere. They have done this 
around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Congressman King, I would like to point that one of the 
examples in my testimony actually involves a would-be jihadi in 
Queens who was in touch with an ISIS handler overseas in Syria 
and was getting instructions on how to carry out an attack in 
New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">This is a different level than just the sort-of, so-called, 
inspired attack. These are a whole new ballgame really in terms 
of counterterrorism, the level of it is anyway. In that regard, 
the FBI has, on a number of occasions, shut down such 
operations. If you go through the public record and courts of 
law, you will see that on numerous occasions they have 
confidential informants and those sorts of people sort-of well-
placed to disrupt these plots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">In some cases the guys are on the other end of the remote-
control attacks here in the United States, really are just 
sort-of doofuses, to be honest with you, who aren't really all 
that menacing I don't think. But in some cases they are. In 
some cases they are a problem. So this is a new sort of 
phenomenon that the FBI over the last couple years has been 
dealing with very carefully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">There is some controversy over some of the FBI's tactics. I 
think that is something that should be actually debated 
publicly in some of these cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Beyond that, you know, beyond looking at that sort-of the 
individual attackers or the lone attackers, the risk of a 
professional attack is still out there and when we are talking 
about well-trained terrorists who are dispatched.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Congressman, at the beginning of the hearing you said, 
rightly, that we haven't suffered another 9/11-scale-style 
attack in the United States and we can all be, of course, 
thankful for that. I think what is often lost in the discourse 
in the United States and elsewhere is that that is not by any 
accident. It is not because the threat has totally disappeared 
or is gone, but is instead the result of military intelligence 
and law enforcement work that is constantly trying to shut down 
these threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">What we do at the Long War Journal is monitor this. Every 
day there is a story about somebody who is being targeted in 
counterterrorism operations overseas who may or may not be 
involved in plotting against the West. In that vein, we all 
recognize, to a certain extent, the threat that ISIS poses and 
what they want to do in the West, what they did in November 
2015 in Paris, what they would like to do elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">But al-Qaeda is still very much in the game. There has been 
a lot of, I would say, erroneous, assessments of al-Qaeda's 
strength that have floated out there. I am just going to give 
you a couple data points on that very quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">In October 2015, the U.S. military, along with its Afghan 
allies, raided what is probably the largest al-Qaeda training 
camp in history in Afghanistan in the Shorabak district of 
Kandahar. It was approximately 30 square miles in size, it 
didn't have any propaganda coming out of there, they didn't 
want you to know they were there, but they were training a lot 
of recruits. This speaks to the fact that the al-Qaeda threat 
in Afghanistan and Pakistan remains there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">I will give you another data point on that. In December 
2016, the U.S. military came out and said that they had killed 
or captured 250 al-Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan throughout 
the calendar year 2016. Doesn't sound like a lot, but it is 
actually two-and-a-half times the high-end estimate that the 
Obama administration had pushed since 2010 on the number of al-
Qaeda operatives in all of Afghanistan. U.S. military also says 
that they are hunting al-Qaeda operatives in seven provinces in 
Afghanistan right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">On top of that, General Nicholson, who runs about the NATO 
Operations Resolute Support and in charge of U.S. forces in 
Afghanistan, recently gave an interview in which he said there 
are plots against U.S. homeland in Afghanistan right now that 
we are trying to counter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">In October of last year, one of the chief al-Qaeda 
operatives responsible for that was killed, a guy named Faruq 
al Qahtani. He was a made man within al-Qaeda circles for many, 
many years. That was one of his jobs; in addition to fighting 
the insurgents in Afghanistan, supporting Taliban operations, 
was to try and plot attacks against the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">On top of that, on January 20 this year, Inauguration Day, 
the Defense Department came out and said they had killed 150 
al-Qaeda terrorists since January 1, so just in the first 19 
days of January, in Syria. In fact, they were forced to attack 
a large al-Qaeda training camp that had been in operation since 
2013.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">We track these operations in Syria and elsewhere to give 
you a sense of what is going on in the world. We are still 
killing guys who joined the jihad in 1979 or 1980 or 1981, who 
are still in the game and are still serving al-Qaeda's cause 
this many years later. If you don't think that they haven't 
thought about the replacements or have had plenty of time to 
groom the replacements, well, then I think we are missing part 
of the story. These guys have been operating for a long, long 
time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Of course, I will leave you one last anecdote on this. Last 
summer, Brett McGurk, who leads the anti-ISIL coalition, you 
know, came out in his testimony before the Senate, and he said 
that in fact al-Qaeda had raised its largest affiliate in 
history in Syria; answering directly to Ayman al-Zawahiri. 
There is no doubt in my mind that al-Qaeda heard that. They 
heard other similar statements that started coming out of the 
Obama administration and decided to change their name and 
pretend that they weren't al-Qaeda anymore. This is their 
famous game. They do this all over the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">But that speaks to the fact this is something that we 
warned about in Long War Journal and in these hearings, 
Congressmen, and elsewhere. They were grooming this huge 
paramilitary force in Syria. It is very easy for them to 
redeploy or carve off some part of that to try and attack, plot 
in the West. They have many obstacles to executing a successful 
attack in the West, many, OK? There is no guaranteed assurance 
that they can actually do this, but the threat is still there.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Prepared Statement of Thomas Joscelyn</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">February 28, 2017</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Chairman King, Ranking Member Rice, and other Members of the 
committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today. The terrorist 
threat has evolved greatly since the September 11, 2001 hijackings. The 
United States arguably faces a more diverse set of threats today than 
ever. In my written and oral testimony, I intend to highlight both the 
scope of these threats, as well as some of what I think are the 
underappreciated risks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">My key points are as follows:
  &lt;bullet&gt; The U.S. military and intelligence services have waged a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">prolific counterterrorism campaign to suppress threats to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">America. It is often argued that because no large-scale plot</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">has been successful in the United States since 9/11 that the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">risk of such an attack is overblown. This argument ignores the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">fact that numerous plots, in various stages of development,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">have been thwarted since 2001. Meanwhile, Europe has been hit</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">with larger-scale operations. In addition, the United States</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">and its allies frequently target jihadists who are suspected of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">plotting against the West. America's counterterrorism strategy</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">is mainly intended to disrupt potentially significant</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">operations that are in the pipeline.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Over the past several years, the U.S. military and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">intelligence agencies claim to have struck numerous Islamic</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">State (or ISIS) and al-Qaeda ``external operatives'' in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Syria,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Yemen, and elsewhere. These so-called ``external operatives''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">are involved in anti-Western plotting. Had they not been</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">targeted, it is likely that at least some of their plans would</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">have come to fruition. Importantly, it is likely that many</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">``external operatives'' remain in the game, and are still</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">laying the groundwork for attacks in the United States and the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">West.
  &lt;bullet&gt; In addition, the Islamic State and al-Qaeda continue to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">adapt new messages in an attempt to inspire attacks abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">U.S. law enforcement has been forced to spend significant</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">resources to stop ``inspired'' plots. As we all know, some of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">them have not been thwarted. The Islamic State's caliphate</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">declaration in 2014 heightened the threat of inspired attacks,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">as would-be jihadists were lured to the false promises of Abu</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Bakr al Baghdadi's cause.
  &lt;bullet&gt; The Islamic State also developed a system for ``remote-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">controlling'' attacks in the West and elsewhere. This system</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">relies on digital operatives who connect with aspiring jihadis</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">via social media applications. The Islamic State has had more</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">success with these types of small-scale operations in Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">But as I explain in my written testimony, the FBI has uncovered</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">a string of plots inside the United States involving these same</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">virtual planners.
  &lt;bullet&gt; The refugee crisis is predominately a humanitarian concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">The Islamic State has used migrant and refugee flows to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">infiltrate terrorists into Europe. Both the Islamic State and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">al-Qaeda could seek to do the same with respect to the United</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">States, however, they have other means for sneaking jihadists</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">into the country as well. While some terrorists have slipped</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">into the West alongside refugees, the United States should</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">remain focused on identifying specific threats.
  &lt;bullet&gt; More than 15 years after 9/11, al-Qaeda remains poorly</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">understood. Most of al-Qaeda's resources are devoted to waging</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">insurgencies in several countries. But as al-Qaeda's insurgency</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">footprint has spread, so has the organization's capacity for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">plotting against the West. On 9/11, al-Qaeda's anti-Western</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">plotting was primarily confined to Afghanistan, with logistical</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">support networks in Pakistan, Iran, and other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Testifying before the Senate in February 2016, Director of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper warned that the al-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Qaeda threat to the West now emanates from multiple countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Clapper testified that al-Qaeda ``nodes in Syria, Pakistan,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Afghanistan, and Turkey'' are ``dedicating resources to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">planning attacks.'' To this list we can add Yemen. And</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">jihadists from Africa have been involved in anti-Western</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">plotting as well. Incredibly, al-Qaeda is still plotting</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">against the United States from Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Both the Islamic State and al-Qaeda continue to seek ways to 
inspire terrorism inside the United States and they are using both new 
and old messages in pursuit of this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">The jihadists have long sought to inspire individuals or small 
groups of people to commit acts of terrorism for their cause. 
Individual terrorists are often described as ``lone wolves,'' but that 
term is misleading. If a person is acting in the name of a global, 
ideological cause, then he or she cannot be considered a ``lone wolf,'' 
even if the individual in question has zero contact with others. In 
fact, single attackers often express their support for the jihadists' 
cause in ways that show the clear influence of propaganda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Indeed, al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) first 
began to aggressively market the idea of ``individual'' or ``lone'' 
operations years ago. AQAP's Inspire magazine is intended to provide 
would-be jihadists with everything they could need to commit an attack 
without professional training or contact. Anwar al-Awlaki, an AQAP 
ideologue who was fluent in English, was an especially effective 
advocate for these types of plots. Despite the fact that Awlaki was 
killed in a U.S. airstrike in September 2011, his teachings remain 
widely available on the internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">The Islamic State capitalized on the groundwork laid by Awlaki and 
AQAP. In fact, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi's operation took these ideas and 
aggressively marketed them with an added incentive. Al-Qaeda has told 
its followers that it wants to eventually resurrect an Islamic 
caliphate. Beginning in mid-2014, the Islamic State began to tell its 
followers that it had already done so in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. 
Baghdadi's so-called caliphate has also instructed followers that it 
would be better for them to strike inside their home countries in the 
West, rather than migrate abroad for jihad. The Islamic State has 
consistently marketed this message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">In May 2016, for instance, Islamic State spokesman Abu Muhammad al 
Adnani told followers that if foreign governments ``have shut the door 
of hijrah [migration] in your faces,'' then they should ``open the door 
of jihad in theirs,'' meaning in the West. ``Make your deed a source of 
their regret,'' Adnani continued. ``Truly, the smallest act you do in 
their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is 
more effective for us and more harmful to them.''\1\

    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">``If one of you wishes and strives to reach the lands of the 
Islamic State,'' Adnani told his audience, ``then each of us wishes to 
be in your place to make examples of the crusaders, day and night, 
scaring them and terrorizing them, until every neighbor fears his 
neighbor.'' Adnani told jihadists that they should ``not make light of 
throwing a stone at a crusader in his land,'' nor should they 
``underestimate any deed, as its consequences are great for the 
mujahidin and its effect is noxious to the disbelievers.''\2\

December 2, 2015 San Bernardino massacre. They pledged allegiance to 
Baghdadi on social media, but Farook had drawn inspiration from Awlaki

---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">The Department of Justice (DOJ) has alleged that other individuals 
who sought to support the Islamic State were first exposed to Awlaki's 
teachings as well.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">\6\ The DOJ made this allegation in the cases involving Emanuel 
Lutchman and Mohamed Bailor Jalloh, as well as others. The Lutchman and 
Jalloh cases are discussed briefly below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">These cases demonstrate that the jihadis have developed a well of 
ideas from which individual adherents can draw, but it may take years 
for them to act on these beliefs, if they ever act on them at all. 
There is no question that the Islamic State has had greater success of 
late in influencing people to act in its name. But al-Qaeda continues 
to produce recruiting materials and to experiment with new concepts for 
individual attacks as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Al-Qaeda and its branches have recently called for revenge for 
Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, who died in a U.S. prison earlier this month. 
Rahman was convicted by a U.S. court for his involvement in plots 
against New York City landmarks in the mid-1990's. Since then, al-Qaeda 
has used Rahman's ``will'' to prophesize his death and to proactively 
blame the United States for it. Approximately 20 years after al-Qaeda 
first started pushing this theme, Rahman finally died. Al-Qaeda's 
continued use of Rahman's prediction, which is really just jihadist 
propaganda, demonstrates how these groups can use the same concepts for 
years, whether or not the facts are consistent with their messaging. 
Al-Qaeda also recently published a kidnapping guide based on old 
lectures by Saif al Adel, a senior figure in the group. Al Adel may or 
may not be currently in Syria. Al-Qaeda is using his lectures on 
kidnappings and hostage operations as a way to potentially teach others 
how to carry them out. The guide was published in both Arabic and 
English, meaning that al-Qaeda seeks an audience in the West for al 
Adel's designs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Both the Islamic State and AQAP also continue to produce English-
language magazines for on-line audiences. The 15th issue of Inspire, 
which was released last year, provided instructions for carrying out 
``professional assassinations.'' AQAP has been creating lists of high-
profile targets in the United States and elsewhere that they hope 
supporters will use in selecting potential victims. AQAP's idea is to 
maximize the impact of ``lone'' attacks by focusing on wealthy 
businessmen or other well-known individuals. AQAP has advocated for, 
and praised, indiscriminate attacks as well. But the group has 
critiqued some attacks (such as the Orlando massacre at a LGBT 
nightclub) for supposedly muddying the jihadists' message. AQAP is 
trying to lay the groundwork for more targeted operations. For example, 
the January 2015 assault on Charlie Hebdo's offices in Paris was set in 
motion by al-Qaeda and AQAP. Inspire even specifically identified the 
intended victims beforehand. Al-Qaeda would like individual actors, 
with no foreign ties, to emulate such precise hits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Meanwhile, the Islamic State has lowered the bar for what is 
considered a successful attack, pushing people to use cars, knives, or 
whatever weapons they can get in their hands. The Islamic State claimed 
that both the September 2016 mall stabbings in Minnesota and the 
vehicular assault at Ohio State University in November 2016 were the 
work of its ``soldiers.''\7\ It may be the case that there were no 
digital ties between these attackers and the Islamic State. However, 
there is often more to the story of how the Islamic State guides such 
small-scale operations.

recruits through small-scale plots that did not require much 
sophistication. These plots targeted victims in France, Germany, 
Russia, and other countries. In some cases, terrorists have received 
virtual support right up until the moment of their attack. The Islamic 
State has had more success orchestrating ``remote-controlled'' plots in 
Europe, but the jihadist group has also tried to carry out similar 
plots inside the United States.\9\

``systematic approach'' to ``enable homeland attacks through continuous 
communications with would-be American jihadis.''

    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Since 2015, if not earlier, the U.S.-led coalition has launched 
airstrikes against the Islamic State operatives responsible for these 
operations. Jihadists such as Rachid Kassim, Junaid Hussain, and Abu 
Issa al Amriki have all been targeted. Both Hussain and al Amriki 
sought to ``remotely-control'' attacks inside the United States They 
have reached into other countries as well. For example, British Prime 
Minister David Cameron connected Hussain to plots in the United 
Kingdom.\10\ And Hussain's wife, Sally Jones, has also reportedly used 
the web to connect with female recruits.

    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">In this section, I will briefly outline several cases in which 
Hussain and al Amriki were in contact with convicted or suspected 
terror recruits inside the United States. In a number of cases, the FBI 
has used confidential informants or other methods in sting operations 
to stop these recruits. It should be noted that it is not always clear 
how much of a threat a suspect really posed and the press has 
questioned the FBI's methods in some of these cases.\13\ I have 
included the examples below to demonstrate how the Islamic State's 
digital operatives have contacted potential jihadists across the United 
States.

    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">\13\ For example, The New York Times cited the Lutchman and

opened fire at an event dedicated to drawing pictures of the Prophet 
Mohammed in Garland, Texas on May 3, 2015. As first reported by the 
SITE Intelligence Group, Hussain (tweeting under one of his aliases) 
quickly claimed the gunmen were acting on behalf of the caliphate. 
Then, in June 2015, Hussain claimed on Twitter that he had encouraged 
Usaamah Rahim, an Islamic State supporter, to carry a knife in case 
anyone attempted to arrest him. Rahim was shot and killed by police in 
Boston after allegedly wielding the blade. The DOJ subsequently 
confirmed that Rahim was ``was communicating with [Islamic State] 
members overseas, including Junaid Hussain.''\14\

    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">On July 7, 2016, Munir Abdulkader, of West Chester, Ohio, pleaded 
guilty to various terrorism-related charges. According to the DOJ, 
Abdulkader communicated with Hussain, who ``directed and encouraged 
Abdulkader to plan and execute a violent attack within the United 
States.'' In conversations with both Hussain and a ``confidential human 
source,'' Abdulkader discussed a plot ``to kill an identified military 
employee on account of his position with the U.S. Government.'' 
Abdulkader planned to abduct ``the employee at the employee's home'' 
and then film this person's execution. After murdering the military 
employee, Abdulkader ``planned to perpetrate a violent attack on a 
police station in the Southern District of Ohio using firearms and 
Molotov cocktails.''\15\ Hussain repeatedly encouraged Islamic State 
followers to attack U.S. military personnel, just as Abdulkader 
planned.

guilty to conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State 
as part of a planned New Year's Eve attack.\16\ Lutchman admittedly 
conspired with Abu Issa al Amriki after he ``initiated on-line 
contact'' with the Islamic State planner on Christmas day 2015. ``In a 
series of subsequent communications,'' DOJ noted, al Amriki ``told 
Lutchman to plan an attack on New Year's Eve and kill a number of 
kuffar [nonbelievers].'' Al Amriki wanted Lutchman ``to write something 
before the attack and give it to'' an Islamic State member, ``so that 
after the attack the [Islamic State] member could post it on-line to 
announce Lutchman's allegiance'' to the so-called caliphate. Lutchman 
wanted to join the Islamic State overseas, but al Amriki encouraged him 
to strike inside the United States, as it would better serve the 
jihadists' cause. ``New years [sic] is here soon,'' al Amriki typed to 
Lutchman. ``Do operations and kill some kuffar.''\17\ Al Amriki also 
promised Lutchman some assistance in traveling to Syria or Libya, if 
the conditions were right. Lutchman divulged his contacts with al 
Amriki to individuals who, ``unbeknownst to Lutchman,'' were 
``cooperating with the FBI.''

He was reportedly en route to Trinidad, but he allegedly intended to 
travel to Libya for jihad. According to DOJ, Daniels was in contact 
with Abu Issa al Amriki, who acted as a ``recruiter and external attack 
planner.'' Daniels said at one point that it was al Amriki who 
``suggested'' he go to Libya ``to support jihad'' and he allegedly 
``wired money to an intermediary'' for al Amriki.\18\ The DOJ did not 
allege that Daniels planned to commit an attack in Ohio or elsewhere

member located overseas during this time. The Islamic State member 
``brokered'' Jalloh's ``introduction'' to the FBI's confidential human

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 15 years after the 9/11 hijackings, al-Qaeda is still</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">plotting against the United States</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Al-Qaeda has not been able to replicate its most devastating attack 
in history, the September 11, 2001 hijackings. But this does not mean 
the al-Qaeda threat has disappeared. Instead, al-Qaeda has evolved. 
There are multiple explanations for why the United States has not been 
struck with another 9/11-style, mass casualty operation.\25\ These 
reasons include: The inherent difficulty in planning large-scale 
attacks, America's improved defenses, and a prolific counterterrorism 
campaign overseas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">\25\ The discussion here is specifically focused on larger-scale 
plots, recognizing that both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State have 
inspired or influenced multiple, smaller-scale operations in the United 
States since 9/11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">In addition, contrary to a widely-held assumption in 
counterterrorism circles, al-Qaeda has not made striking the United 
States its sole priority. In fact, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri 
has even ordered his men in Syria to stand down at times, as they 
prioritized the war against Bashar al Assad's regime over bombings, 
hijackings, or other assaults in the West. However, Zawahiri could 
change his calculation at any time, and it would then be up to 
America's intelligence and law enforcement officials to detect and 
thwart specific plots launched from Syria. One additional caveat here 
is warranted. Despite the fact that Zawahiri has not given the final 
green light for an anti-Western operation launched from Syrian soil, 
al-Qaeda has been laying the groundwork for such attacks in Syria and 
elsewhere. There is a risk that al-Qaeda could seek to launch Mumbai-
style attacks in American or European cities, bomb trains or other mass 
transit locations, plant sophisticated explosives on Western airliners, 
or dream up some other horrible attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">In September 2014, the Obama administration announced that it 
launched airstrikes against al-Qaeda's so-called ``Khorasan Group'' in 
Syria. There was some confusion surrounding this group. The Khorasan 
Shura is an elite body within al-Qaeda and part of this group is 
dedicated to launching ``external operations,'' that is, attacks in the 
West. Several significant leaders in the Khorasan Group were previously 
based in Iran, where al-Qaeda maintains a core facilitation hub. In 
fact, at least two Khorasan figures previously headed al-Qaeda's Iran-
based network, which shuttles operatives throughout the Middle East and 
sometimes into the West. As I have previously testified before this 
committee, some foiled al-Qaeda plots against the West were facilitated 
by operatives based in Iran.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">\26\ See my testimony during the May 22, 2013 subcommittee hearing: 
Thomas Joscelyn, ``Assessing the Threat to the Homeland from al Qaeda 
Operations in Iran and Syria,'' Testimony before the House Committee on 
Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, 
May 22, 2013. (http://docs.house.gov/meetings/HM/HM05/20130522/100901/
HHRG-113-HM05-WState-JoscelynT-920130522.pdf).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Al-Qaeda began relocating senior operatives to Syria in 2011. And 
the United States has targeted known or obscure al-Qaeda veterans in 
Syria in the years since, often citing their presumed threat to the 
United States and the West. I will not list all of these operatives 
here, but we regularly track the al-Qaeda figures targeted in drone 
strikes at FDD's Long War Journal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">During the final months of the Obama administration, American 
military and intelligence officials highlighted al-Qaeda's continued 
plotting against the United States on multiple occasions. And there was 
also a shift in America's air campaign, from targeted strikes on 
individual al-Qaeda operatives in Syria to bombings intended to destroy 
whole training camps or other facilities. In addition, the U.S. 
Treasury and State Departments began to designate terrorist leaders 
within al-Qaeda's branch in Syria who may not play any direct role in 
international operations. This change in tactics reflects the 
realization that al-Qaeda has built its largest paramilitary force in 
history in Syria. And while only part of this force may have an eye on 
the West, there is often no easy way to delineate between jihadists 
involved in al-Qaeda's insurgency operations and those who are 
participating in plots against America or European nations.\27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">\27\ Most of al-Qaeda's paramilitary fighters in Syria will remain 
focused on the war against Bashar al Assad's regime and Assad's allies. 
However, some of the key al-Qaeda operatives killed in U.S. drone 
strikes have played multiple roles within the organization, meaning 
they can walk (fight on the ground in Syria) and chew gum (plot against 
the West) at the same time. And training facilities can be used for 
these dual purposes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">In October 2016, the Defense Department announced that the United 
States had carried out ``transregional'' airstrikes against al-Qaeda's 
``external'' operatives in Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda 
``doesn't recognize borders when they conspire to commit terrorist 
attacks against the West, and we will continue to work with our 
partners and allies to find and destroy their leaders, their fighters 
and their cells that are planning attacks externally,'' Pentagon 
spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said shortly after the bombings. Davis 
added that some of al-Qaeda's ``external'' plotters enjoyed a 
``friendly, hospitable environment'' within al-Nusrah Front, which was 
the name used by al-Qaeda's guerrilla army in Syria until mid-2016. 
Davis added that the jihadists targeted ``are people who are from 
outside Syria in many cases and who are focused on external 
operations.''\28\

    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">The Pentagon provided short descriptions for each of the al-Qaeda 
operatives targeted in October 2016. On October 17, Haydar Kirkan was 
killed in Idlib, Syria. He was ``a long-serving and experienced 
facilitator and courier for al-Qaeda in Syria,'' who ``had ties to al-
Qaeda senior leaders, including Osama bin Laden.'' Davis added that 
Kirkan ``was al-Qaeda's senior external terror attack planner in Syria, 
Turkey, and Europe.''\29\ Kirkan oversaw a significant network inside 
Turkey.\30\ The United States has killed a number of individuals with 
backgrounds similar to Kirkan since 2014.

    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">Then, on October 23, two senior al-Qaeda leaders, Farouq al-Qahtani 
and Bilal al-Utabi, were killed in airstrikes in Afghanistan. Qahtani 
was one of al-Qaeda's most prominent figures in the Afghan insurgency, 
as he was the group's emir for eastern Afghanistan and coordinated 
operations with the Taliban. Osama bin Laden's files indicate that 
Qahtani was responsible for re-establishing al-Qaeda's safe havens in 
Afghanistan in 2010, if not earlier.\32\ But Qahtani was also tasked 
with plotting attacks in the West.

    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">On January 20, the Defense Department announced that ``more than 
150 al-Qaeda terrorists'' had been killed in Syria since the beginning 
of 2017.\37\ In addition to individual terrorists involved in plotting 
against the West, the United States struck the Shaykh Sulayman training 
camp, which had been ``operational since at least 2013.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn ">    The reality is that al-Qaeda now operates large training camps in 
more countries today than on 9/11. The next 9/11-style plotters could 
be in those camps, or fighting in jihadist insurgencies, right now. If 
so, it will be up to America's offensive counterterrorism campaign and 
its defenses to stop them.

    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. King">Our next witness is Robin Simcox. Mr. Simcox specializes in 
terrorism and National security analysis as the Margaret 
Thatcher fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Prior to joining 
Heritage last year, he was a research fellow at the Henry 
Jackson Society, a foreign policy think tank in London. He also 
has testified several times before this committee on terror 
threats and radicalization.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simcox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Simcox">Thank you, Chairman King, distinguished Members
of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify 
here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Simcox">My goal is to highlight just some of the issues which have 
hindered U.S. counterterrorism efforts in recent years. Allow 
me to suggest three specific areas to which the United States 
could devote more attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Simcox">The first area lies in defining the enemy. The United 
States dedicates a huge amount of resources to 
counterterrorism, yet U.S. policy makers and, arguably, us as a 
society, seem to be no closer to a consensus on where the 
source of this terrorist threat emerges from and who exactly 
our real adversaries are. President Trump refers to the enemy 
as radical Islamic terrorism. If this is the lexicon to be 
used, then serious thought needs to be given to what 
constitutes a radical Islamic terrorist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Simcox">I am sure we can all agree that it includes al-Qaeda and 
ISIS, yet al-Qaeda and ISIS are manifestations of a broader 
Islamist movement. The ideology that propels these groups 
transcends the tens of thousands of their fighters that the 
United States is most fixated upon in the short term. So are we 
just focused on those willing to use violence to achieve their 
goals or should our ambitions be grander?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Simcox">For example, there is currently a discussion over whether 
to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist 
organization. Yet whether the United States does so or not 
cannot deflect from the broader questions that must be 
answered, such as, are we aiming to defeat or discredit all 
forms of political Islam? If so, how do we reconcile this aim 
with broader diplomatic goals? After all, not so long ago, the 
Brotherhood came to power in Tunisia and Egypt. So do we need 
different strategies to deal with Islamism at home and abroad?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Simcox">What about those Salafists whose ideology we may find 
harmful and socially divisive, but who say they are non-
political? I don't think a lot of serious thought has gone into 
some of these questions over recent years, and I think it might 
be worthwhile beginning to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Simcox">The second area lies with the Countering Violent Extremism, 
CVE, initiative. Accordance of Department for Homeland 
Security, CVE aims to address the root causes of violent 
extremism by providing resources to communities to build and 
sustain local prevention efforts and promote the use of counter 
narratives to confront violent extremist messaging on-line. CVE 
should not be dismissed out of hand, but it should also be 
limited in scope and the United States must develop robust ways 
of measuring the success of its initiatives. Otherwise, there 
is a possibility that the United States makes the same mistakes 
some of its allies have made with such programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Simcox">Let me provide an example of this from the United Kingdom. 
So clearly, it is only Muslims who have the knowledge and 
credibility within their communities to tackle Islamist 
extremism most effectively, yet CVE partners should also be 
supportive of some very basic principles, such as a belief in 
democracy, religious freedom, equality, and freedom of speech. 
In the United Kingdom, this was not the case. Too much trust 
was placed in certain groups claiming to be representative of 
British Muslim opinion, yet organizationally and ideologically 
tied to Islamist groups in South Asia and North Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Simcox">Such groups did not adhere to basic British values, yet 
they gained the ear of the government and worked to shut down 
conversation about any ideological and theological roots of 
terrorism and instead pushed an agenda that placed acts of 
terrorism solely at the door of U.S. and U.K. foreign policy. 
The legacy of this continues to hamper U.K. policy in this area 
today, and I fear a similar thing could happen in the United 
States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Simcox">The third area lies with encouraging reform from key 
international partners. ISIS would clearly like to carry out a 
terrorist attack in the United States. So far, however, there 
are no known cases of ISIS operatives being able to infiltrate 
the United States from abroad and then commit such an attack. 
This is not the case in Europe, however, where ISIS has had far 
more success. This has a clear relevance to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Simcox">Approximately over 1\1/2\ million American citizens live in 
Europe and that is not even counting all those who live on 
military bases. Americans have already been killed in terrorist 
attacks in Paris in November 2015, Brussels in March 2016, and 
Nice in July 2016. Unfortunately, European countries that are 
threatened by ISIS usually do not have sufficiently robust 
counterterrorism defenses in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Simcox">Therefore, the United States must do what it can to protect 
its citizens by encouraging certain European partners to spend 
more money on counterterrorism efforts, reform their complex 
intelligence apparatuses, and to take a more robust approach to 
law and order and border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Simcox">These are just some of the challenges U.S. security policy 
must address. Yet by working with its allies abroad, a multi-
pronged and nuanced approach to the threat at home and a 
clearer understanding of the ideology that threatens the United 
States, some headway can be made.</paragraph>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Simcox follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, and I 
look forward to your questions and comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">Prepared Statement of Robin Simcox</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">February 24, 2017</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">Chairman King and distinguished Members of the subcommittee, thank 
you for the opportunity to testify here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">My name is Robin Simcox. I am the Margaret Thatcher fellow at the 
Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation. My 
responsibilities at The Heritage Foundation consist of research on 
terrorism and security policy, issues I have published and written 
widely on for almost 10 years, both here in the United States and in 
Europe. The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not 
be construed as representing any official position of The Heritage 
Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">My goal in this testimony is to highlight just some issues which 
have hindered either U.S. homeland security counterterrorism efforts or 
presented a threat to American lives in recent years. Allow me to 
suggest three specific areas which the United States could devote more 
attention and ultimately decrease the threat posed to American 
citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">define the enemy</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">The United States dedicates a huge amount of resources to 
counterterrorism. This issue is now part of the National conversation. 
It was discussed endlessly on the campaign trail and virtually every 
day in National newspapers. Yet the U.S. Government, and arguably us as 
a society, seem to be no closer to identifying who exactly it is we are 
fighting. We talk about needing to win the war of ideas--yet against 
precisely which ideas?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">President Trump refers to the enemy as ``radical Islamic 
terrorism.'' He has received criticism from some for speaking so 
bluntly, but at least there is an attempt to define who or what the 
United States is trying to defeat in terms that most of the country 
understands. However, if this is the lexicon to be used, then serious 
thought needs to be given to what constitutes a radical Islamic 
terrorist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">I am sure we can all agree that al-Qaeda and ISIS constitute the 
enemy. They are the most pressing security threats and need to be 
treated with the utmost seriousness. Yet the unpleasant reality is that 
the ideology that propels these groups transcends the tens of thousands 
of their fighters that the United States is most fixated upon in the 
short term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">In this context, we need to give greater thought to movements such 
as the Muslim Brotherhood. There is currently discussion over whether 
to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.\1\ The 
Brotherhood share almost identical goals to terrorist groups such as 
al-Qaeda and ISIS but with key differences regarding the use of 
violence in achieving these goals.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>

Designation for Muslim Brotherhood,'' The New York Times, February 7,

brotherhood (accessed February 23, 2017).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">Yet whether the United States bans the Brotherhood or not cannot 
deflect from the broader questions that must be answered. Are we just 
focused on those willing to use violence to achieve their goals? What 
forms of Salafism constitute a threat? Are we aiming to defeat all 
forms of political Islam? If so, how do we reconcile this aim with 
broader diplomatic goals, such as when the Muslim Brotherhood came to 
power in Tunisia? What about other Islamist parties that could feasibly 
end up governing countries?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">These are key questions to consider. As one Heritage Foundation 
report argues,
``Countering the illiberal agendas of Islamist parties is vital to 
protecting American core national security interests. Islamists often 
pursue policies that undermine individual freedoms and lead to 
discrimination, repression, and violence against religious minority 
groups and women. Their lenient policies toward terrorist groups also 
undercut U.S. counterterrorism measures and encourage a permissive 
environment for extremists to plot, plan, and train for international 
terrorist attacks.''\2\

rising-global-islamism (accessed February 23, 2017).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">The previous administration took a minimalist approach focused very 
narrowly on the violent Islamists of ISIS, al-Qaeda, and their belief 
system. My preference would be for a much broader approach. ISIS, al-
Qaeda, and their supporters are manifestations of a broader Islamist 
movement. It is vital, therefore, that the appeal of the ideology of 
Islamism itself is undermined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">countering violent extremism (cve)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">According to the Department for Homeland Security website, ``CVE 
aims to address the root causes of violent extremism by providing 
resources to communities to build and sustain local prevention efforts 
and promote the use of counter-narratives to confront violent extremist 
messaging on-line.''\3\

Extremism, January 19, 2017, https://www.dhs.gov/countering-violent-
extremism (accessed February 23, 2017).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">This is a worthy cause and one that is not always well-understood. 
Establishing lines of dialog between local Muslim communities, local 
government, and the police, or providing alternative pathways for 
potential radicals--particularly the young--should be one option among 
many in reducing the threat posed by Islamism. Indeed, this kind of 
work is being pursued in various forms by governments across the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">Yet such programs should be an occasional complement to law 
enforcement efforts and not a replacement. Furthermore, the United 
States must avoid mistakes some of its allies have made with such 
programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">For example, there will be a temptation to allow the CVE agenda to 
metastasize. This runs the risk of wasting a lot of money and 
empowering some of the wrong people. Clearly it is only Muslims who 
have the knowledge and credibility within their communities to head up 
this fight. Yet by placing too much trust in certain groups or 
individuals claiming to be representative of Muslim opinion, the United 
States may end up empowering those who practice a highly intolerant 
form of Islam. This is precisely what happened in the United Kingdom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">Another lesson from the United Kingdom was that well-organized 
Islamist groups gained the ear of the government and subsequently 
worked to shut down any conversation about the ideological and 
theological roots of terrorism and relentlessly pushed an agenda of 
grievances, usually related to foreign policy. These groups falsely 
portray themselves as gatekeepers to the entire, diverse Muslim 
population of a country. Some Muslim Brotherhood front groups even 
ended up being funded by the British government.\4\ I see a similar 
situation potentially arising in the United States.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">So CVE should be limited in scope and the United States must 
develop robust ways of measuring the success of its initiatives. Its 
CVE partners should be carefully vetted and be supportive of basic 
American principles: Such as a belief in democracy, religious freedom, 
equality, tolerance, freedom of speech, and the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">There is one additional comment on CVE I would like to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">It was recently reported by Reuters that CVE is to be renamed 
either ``Countering Islamic Extremism'' or ``Countering Radical Islamic 
Extremism.''\5\ These may not be my precise preference as a choice of 
words--I believe a focus on the political ideology of Islamism is 
preferable--but I think this is a step forwards.

    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">Changing the language is not a panacea in and of itself, but 
greater honesty about the area of primary concern is a positive 
development. It conveys a clearer idea to the American people that the 
White House is aware of the threat of Islamism specifically and is 
tailoring policy accordingly. I find the generic ``violent extremist'' 
does the opposite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">The United States should not be hampered by an approach which 
implies that all extremists pose the same gravity of threat to the 
homeland. This is not the case. Eco-terrorists do not pose the same 
threat as ISIS-inspired terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">All terrorist threats must be vigorously addressed but there is not 
a one-size-fits-all approach to every ideology. The greatest threat to 
American lives comes from Islamist terrorists and our counter-
radicalization efforts should surely reflect that.\6\

Association of American Residents Overseas, approximately over 1.5 
million American citizens live in Europe.\8\ This does not include all 
those Americans on military bases housed throughout Europe, which are 
also an appealing target for Islamist terrorists. Already, an American 
was killed in the Paris attacks of November 2015. Four Americans were 
killed in Brussels in March 2016. Another three were killed in an 
attack in Nice in July 2016. More casualties are likely.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">Unfortunately, European countries that are threatened by ISIS 
usually do not have the robust counterterrorism defenses in place that 
the United States does. Therefore, the United States must do what it 
can to protect its citizens by:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Maintaining a strong intelligence-sharing alliance with</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">relevant European partners.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Encouraging our European partners to spend more money on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">counterterrorism efforts.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Encouraging our European partners to take a tougher approach</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">to law and order (for example, jail those convicted of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">terrorism-related activity for longer periods).

    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">and complex intelligence and security apparatus.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Imploring Europe to get tougher on border security. The</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">borderless travel that exists in much of continental Europe has</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">proven to be easily exploitable for a transnational terror</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">network like ISIS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Simcox ">    Anyone who has any experience in dealing with European approaches 
to counterterrorism is aware of what a challenging task this is. 
However, it is important for the United States to focus even more 
attention on such issues.

    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. King">Thank you Mr. Simcox.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. King">Our final witness is Peter Bergen who has also appeared 
before this committee and certainly both this committee and the 
Intelligence Committee, where I also serve, we have see him a 
number of times. He is a vice president and director of the 
fellows program and the international security program at New 
America in the District of Columbia, a professor of practice at

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Thank you, Chairman King. Thank you, Ranking
Member Rice and the other distinguished Members of the 
committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bergen">I don't want to sort-of repeat what has already been said, 
so focusing perhaps more on what we can do or what we shouldn't 
do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bergen">So two things we shouldn't do. The visa ban--the visa ban 
is a temporary ban from the seven Muslim majority countries is 
totally ineffective if you look at what has actually happened 
since 9/11. As it is presently constructed, it would be a bit 
like saying we have a problem with gangs from Central America 
that have roots in Salvador, and therefore, we should stop 
people from Argentina or Chile and Canada coming into the 
United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bergen">It doesn't make any sense, because of the 94 Americans that 
have been killed by terrorists since 9/11, according to 
research conducted by New America and my team is here with me, 
none of these attacks were conducted by the seven Muslim-
majority country nationals and none of their families came from 
these countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bergen">So there seems to be a campaign promise that hasn't really 
been thought through very carefully and let us see what happens 
tomorrow as they move the goal posts on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bergen">But the real issue is Americans radicalizing here in this 
country and they are radicalizing because of what they are 
reading on-line. Of the 117 Americans who have traveled to 
Syria to join ISIS or other groups, 88 of them were heavy users 
of the internet, not just sending e-mails, but posting jihadist 
material, sometimes, as other people testifying here have said, 
communicating directly with ISIS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Now, the internet is not subject to a visa ban, so the 
issue is really a question of how to deal with that problem, 
the Americans radicalizing here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bergen">A second bad idea, which Mr. Simcox has sort-of gestured 
at, is the idea of banning or designating the Muslim 
Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. This would be very 
stupid. This would be akin to saying because everybody in this 
country who attacks an abortion clinic is a Christian 
fundamentalist, we should designate Christian fundamentalists 
as terrorists. This makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bergen">The Muslim Brotherhood is a movement of tens of millions of 
people, a tiny minority of whom have then gone on to join al-
Qaeda. The Muslim Brotherhood was important members of close 
American allies in the government in Jordan, in Kuwait, in 
Tunisia, in Iraq, people that we need to work with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bergen">OK, so an idea that would work is an idea actually proposed 
by Chairman King, which is the no-fly, no-buy idea. Now, it is 
astonishing that Major Nidal Hasan who killed 13 people at Fort 
Hood, Omar Mateen who killed 49 people in Orlando, and Carlos 
Bledsoe who killed an American soldier in Little Rock, Arkansas 
in 2009 legally purchased semiautomatic weapons, despite the 
fact that they were the subjects of FBI scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bergen">The NRA has put up a huge smoke screen about this issues 
saying, well, some people on the no-fly list shouldn't be 
there. Well, that is ridiculous because there are 81,000 people 
on the no-fly list, 800 of whom or only 800 of whom are 
Americans. Maybe one of them shouldn't be on the list. But the 
idea that there is sort-of a problem with it is just crazy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Another idea is we should stay in Afghanistan. I think one 
of the more counterproductive things the Obama administration 
did was say we are constantly withdrawing. We are not going to 
withdraw from Afghanistan, you know, in my lifetime, I think, 
and it is right for the United States security, it is right for 
security for other countries around the world and for Afghans, 
they want us to stay. So I hope that the administration has a 
robust policy in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bergen">It is not about the number of troops, it is about the 
political messaging around it. Afghans don't care if it is 
8,400 troops as we have now or 12,000. From a purely military 
point of view there is a difference, but it is the political 
messaging. We have a strategic partnership with Afghanistan 
until 2024, let us stay there, let us say we are going to stay 
there until we can really eliminate some of the threats that 
Mr. Joscelyn talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Something that is working is micro-targeting. Now, if I 
look for shoes on-line, for the rest of my life I am going to 
get advertisements about shoes on-line. I think the GEC at 
State has actually moved to a much better policy which is, we 
are going to micro-target people looking for ISIS propaganda, 
we are going to have counter-messages in local languages. 
Google is doing some of this, too. This is actually something 
that at least does no harm, and may actually work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bergen">I think it was very useful that we talked about the attacks 
on Jewish targets, because of the 94 Americans that have been 
killed by jihadi terrorists since 9/11, 50 have been killed by 
extreme right-wing militants, including a number at, for 
instance, in Kansas City in 2014 by a neo-Nazi. Also, we had 
the incident at the Holocaust Museum here in Washington. Also, 
we also have a black separatist militant who has killed five 
people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Bergen">In an era of increasing polarization, we shouldn't be 
completely fixated on jihadi terrorism. Look just here in this 
city. On December 5 we, I think, missed, you know, something 
could have been very serious, at Comet Pizza where a man armed 
with a semiautomatic weapon came into the pizza restaurant and 
was planning to do violence. Luckily he was disabled before he 
could do anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Finally, picking up on what some of what Commissioner Davis 
said, enlisting the Muslim community is the right approach 
because the FBI has done a very interesting study of 80 
terrorism cases since 2009, and the study may be larger by now, 
but what they found was, the people who know the most about a 
potential attack are peers and the people who know the second-
most are family members, then next authority figures like 
clerics or teachers. Finally, strangers know the least.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Bergen">The people most likely to drop a dime are strangers, but 
they have the least useful information. So we see in the San 
Bernardino case, Enrique Marquez actually knew a lot about what 
was going to happen. Unfortunately, he didn't say anything. So 
we really want to get those people to come forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Just two other quick points. I am very concerned about the 
insider threat from airports, which is something this committee 
I am sure is concerned about, too. Sinai shows that this is the 
one way they can get their holy grail. There are 103 countries 
that have direct flights to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Now, if you are taking a direct flight from Heathrow, that 
is probably less of a problem than, let's say, from, you know, 
some other countries. But I think this is a real area.</paragraph>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Bergen follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The final issue that I would like to focus on is the 
question of armed drones. You know, Hezbollah and ISIS have all 
used armed drones in combat. There is a vast proliferation. 
American embassies overseas are well-protected against truck 
bombs. Are they well-protected against armed drones?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Prepared Statement of Peter Bergen</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">February 28, 2017</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">This testimony is organized into 8 sections:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">1. What is the terrorism threat to the United States?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">2. What is the terrorism threat posed by citizens of proposed</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">7. A discussion of some future trends in terrorism;</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">6. Finally, what can be done to reduce the threat from jihadist</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">terrorists?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">1. what is the terrorism threat to the united states?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The ISIS attacks in Brussels last year and in Paris in 2015 
underlined the threat posed by returning Western ``foreign fighters'' 
from the conflicts in Syria and Iraq who have been trained by ISIS or 
other jihadist groups there. Six of the attackers in Paris were 
European nationals who had trained with ISIS in Syria. Yet in the 
United States, the threat from returning foreign fighters is quite 
limited. According to FBI Director James Comey, 250 Americans have gone 
or attempted to go to Syria. This figure is far fewer than the 
estimated 6,900 who have traveled to Syria from Western nations as a 
whole--the vast majority from Europe. As many as 1,900 of those 
militants have returned, according to an estimate by the House 
Committee on Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">At home, the United States has not faced any threats from ISIS-
trained militants, but it does face a threat from extremists inspired 
by ISIS, or that are in some cases in direct communication with ISIS 
through encrypted communications. The home-grown terror threat poses a 
knotty, multi-layered problem for United States law enforcement. It's 
hard for the United States intelligence community to track lone wolves 
who are not communicating with foreign terrorist organizations via 
email or phone. Nor do lone wolves have meetings with co-conspirators 
of the type that can be monitored by the FBI, while domestic extremists 
who are in touch with ISIS using encrypted communications are using the 
type of encryption that cannot be easily decrypted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The FBI said in 2016 that it was conducting some 1,000 
investigations of suspected Islamist militants; many of these will be 
dismissed, rightly, as not causes for true alarm, but the attack by 
Omar Mateen in Orlando that killed 49 reminds us that despite all these 
FBI investigations, sometimes America's home-grown terrorists will 
still slip through the net. This will be ISIS' legacy in the United 
States: The crowdsourcing of jihad, so that men like Omar Mateen can 
quickly convert their personal grievances into what they believe is a 
righteous holy war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">From court records and news reports New America identified 117 
American militants who have traveled to Syria to join militant groups, 
attempted to travel to Syria to do so, or provided support for those 
who did. Of those, 74 were arrested before reaching Syria. For example, 
Shannon Conley, a 19-year-old woman from Colorado, pleaded guilty in 
2014 to conspiring to provide material support to ISIS. She never set 
foot in Syria, as she was arrested at the Denver International Airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Forty-three did manage to reach Syria and join a militant group. Of 
those, 17 are dead. Douglas McAuthur McCain, for instance, a Muslim 
convert from California, was killed in 2014 fighting for ISIS in a 
battle against the Free Syrian Army. Recently unsealed court documents 
suggest that Adnan Fazeli, a 38-year-old man who settled in Maine after 
coming to the United States as a refugee from Iran, died fighting for 
ISIS in 2015 in a battle against the Lebanese army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Only 8 American militants returning from Syria have been arrested 
and only one is alleged to have plotted an attack in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Court documents allege that Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a 23-year-old 
from Ohio, left to fight in Syria in April 2014 before returning to the 
United States 2 months later. After his return to the United States, he 
was monitored by an informant, leading to his arrest. Mohamud has 
pleaded not guilty to plotting an attack on a United States military 
base.
The United States is now a hard target for foreign terrorist</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The United States today is a hard target for foreign terrorist 
organizations that have not carried out a successful attack in the 
States since 9/11. That is in part because of the defensive measures 
the States has taken. On 9/11, there were 16 people on the United 
States ``no fly'' list. By 2016 there were 81,000. In 2001, there were 
35 Joint Terrorism Task Force ``fusion centers,'' where multiple law 
enforcement agencies worked together to chase down leads and build 
terrorism cases. A decade-and-a-half later there were more than 100. 
Before 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security, National 
Counterterrorism Center, and Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) all did not exist. Annoying as it is for many Americans to go 
through a TSA checkpoint at an airport, it is a strong deterrent for 
terrorists inclined to smuggle any kind of weapon on board a plane. 
While it's impossible to decisively measure the impact of programs 
designed to make attacks not happen, the relatively few successful 
jihadist terrorist attacks in the States in the years since 9/11 do 
seem indicative that, broadly speaking, American defensive measures are 
working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Another important change: At the dawn of the 21st Century, the 
American public didn't comprehend the threat posed by jihadist 
terrorists. That changed dramatically after 9/11. In December 2001, the 
passengers on an American Airlines jet disabled the ``shoe bomber,'' 
Richard Reid, as the plane flew between Paris and Miami. Similarly, 8 
years later it was his fellow passengers who tackled the ``underwear 
bomber'' Umar Abdulmutallab on Northwest Flight 253 as it flew over 
Detroit. And the following year it was a street vendor who spotted a 
suspicious SUV parked in Times Square that contained the bomb planted 
there by Pakistani Taliban recruit, Faisal Shahzad. The public's 
awareness of terrorism as a domestic threat is a significant force 
multiplier to the other measures put in place to defend the 
``homeland'' after 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Aiding those defensive measures is the United States' offense 
overseas. In 2013, the United States allocated $72 billion to 
intelligence collection and other covert activities. Before 9/11, the 
budget was around a third of that figure: $26 billion. CIA drones may 
be controversial, but they also did significant damage to al-Qaeda in 
Pakistan and in Yemen killing dozens of the group's leaders. While it's 
impossible to decisively measure the impact of programs designed to 
make attacks not happen, neither branch of al-Qaeda was able to launch 
a successful attack on the States after 9/11 in part because of the 
pressure that the drone program put them under.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The threat from al-Qaeda, ISIS, and similar groups has receded 
significantly from its high point on 9/11. The threat inside the States 
is lone-wolf attacks such as the attack in Orlando in June 2016. As 
described above, in the past decade-and-a-half 94 Americans have been 
killed in the United States by jihadist terrorists. Shocking and tragic 
as these attacks have been, they still pale in comparison to al-Qaeda's 
murder of almost 3,000 people on the morning of 9/11.
Other Forms of Political Violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Political violence has long been a feature of American life. In the 
1970's leftist groups such as the Weather Underground and the Black 
Panthers conducted a number of terrorist attacks. In 1995 two men 
animated by extreme right-wing beliefs conducted what was then the most 
lethal terrorist attack on America soil in Oklahoma City, killing 168 
people. Since 9/11, according to New America's research, in addition to 
the 94 people killed by jihadist terrorists, terrorists motivated by 
extreme right-wing beliefs killed 50 people, while 5 were killed by a 
militant black separatist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Since this hearing is about threats to domestic security focusing 
only on jihadist terrorism would miss other threats, particularly in an 
era of increased polarization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In November, for instance a story circulated on several websites 
that Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager John Podesta were running 
a child sex ring out the basement of the Comet Ping Pong pizza joint in 
northwest Washington, DC. This patently absurd story prompted 28-year-
old Edgar Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina to travel to Washington to 
``self-investigate.'' On December 5 Welch walked into the popular pizza 
restaurant carrying an assault rifle and started firing shots. He 
pointed the firearm in the direction of a restaurant employee who fled 
and notified police who arrested Welch. Welch told investigators that 
he had come armed to help rescue the children and he also told a 
reporter with masterful understatement ``the intel on this wasn't 100 
percent.''
Weapons of Mass Destruction and Terrorists in the States</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Despite all the hysterical commentary about the issue, in the 
decade-and-a-half since 9/11 jihadist terrorists in the States have not 
developed, acquired, or deployed chemical, biological, radiological, or 
nuclear (CBRN) weapons. This is a striking finding that is worth 
underlining: Of the 399 cases of jihadist terrorism in the States 
examined by New America, not one involved CBRN. Chemical and biological 
weapons and their precursors, however, were either developed or 
deployed over the past decade-and-a-half in the States by 13 far-right 
militants, one leftist militant and two with idiosyncratic motives, 
such as Bruce Ivins who launched the anthrax attacks in Washington and 
New York in the months after 9/11.
 2. do citizens of countries targeted by the proposed temporary travel</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">ban pose a threat to the united states?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">On January 27 President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order 
instituting a temporary travel ban on foreign nationals traveling from 
seven majority-Muslim countries--Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, 
Syria, and Yemen. New America has collected data on 399 individuals 
accused of jihadist terrorism-related crimes since 9/11. That research 
shows that of the 94 people killed by jihadist terrorists inside the 
United States since 9/11, not a single death would have been prevented 
by the travel ban. Far from being foreign infiltrators, the large 
majority of jihadist terrorists in the United States are American 
citizens or legal residents. Almost half were born American citizens. 
No deadly attacker since 9/11 emigrated from one of the countries 
listed under the travel ban. Nor did any of the 9/11 hijackers come 
from one of the travel ban countries. Nor did any of the deadly post-9/
11 terrorists come from a family that had emigrated from one of the 
travel ban countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The proposed travel ban is akin to saying that because the United 
States has a significant problem with gangs that have their roots in 
Central America, therefore it should ban travel from Argentina and 
Chile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Of the 12 lethal jihadist terrorists in the United States since 9/
11:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Three, Carlos Bledsoe, Alton Nolen, and Ali Muhammad Brown</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">are African-Americans born in the United States, and Bledsoe</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">can trace his family's United States military service back to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">the Civil War.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Three, Syed Rizwan Farook, Tashfeen Malik, and Naveed Haq</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">are from families that hailed originally from Pakistan. Farook</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">and Haq were born in the United States while Malik entered on a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">K-1 Spouse Visa and later becoming a legal permanent resident.
  &lt;bullet&gt; One, Nidal Hasan, is from a family that came from the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Palestinian Territories and was born in the United States. His</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">parents had immigrated to the United States during the 1960's.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Two, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, came from</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Russia as children. Dzhokhar became a naturalized citizen while</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Tamerlan was a permanent resident.
  &lt;bullet&gt; One, Hesham Hadayet, emigrated from Egypt and conducted his</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">attack a decade after coming to the United States. Hadayet was</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">a permanent resident.
  &lt;bullet&gt; One, Mohammed Abdulazeez, was born in Kuwait to Palestinian-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Jordanian parents and became a naturalized citizen.
  &lt;bullet&gt; One, Omar Mateen, is from an Afghan family and was born in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Of 15 individuals who have conducted non-lethal terrorist attacks 
inside the United States since 9/11, only three came from countries 
covered by the travel ban. However, in two of those cases, the 
individual entered the United States as a child.
  &lt;bullet&gt; On March 3, 2006 Mohammed Reza Taheri-Azar, a naturalized</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">citizen from Iran, drove a car into a group of students at the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">University of North Carolina, injuring nine people. However,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Taheri-Azar, though born in Iran, came to the United States at</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">the age of two. As a result his radicalization was home-grown</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">inside the United States.
  &lt;bullet&gt; On September 17, 2016 Dahir Adan, a 20-year-old naturalized</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">citizen from Somalia, injured ten people while wielding a knife</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">at a mall in Minnesota. However, like Taheri-Azar, Adan had</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">come to the United States as a young child.
  &lt;bullet&gt; On November 28, 2016 Abdul Razak Ali, an 18-year-old legal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">permanent resident who came to the United States as a refugee</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">from Somalia in 2014--having left Somalia for Pakistan in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">2007--injured 11 people when he rammed a car into a group of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">his fellow students on the campus of Ohio State University and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">then attacked them with a knife. However, it is not clear that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">the attack provides support for Trump's travel ban. Artan left</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Somalia as a pre-teen, and if he was radicalized abroad, it</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">most likely occurred while in Pakistan, which is not included</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">on the travel ban. Furthermore, it is far from clear that Artan</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">radicalized abroad rather than inside the United States. In a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Facebook posting prior to his attack, he cited Anwar al-Awlaki,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">the Yemeni-American cleric born in the United States, whose</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">work has helped radicalize a wide range of extremists in the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">United States including those born in the United States.
Syrian refugees settling in the States are not terrorists</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">On January 27 President Trump also signed the Executive Order that 
aimed to suspend the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States 
indefinitely. As he signed the order, President Trump said that this 
was ``to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States.'' 
This order will achieve absolutely nothing because there is no evidence 
of terrorists among the Syrian refugees who are settling in the United 
States. That shouldn't be too surprising, because the United States has 
accepted only a minuscule number of Syrian refugees, even though the 
Syrian civil war is one of the worst humanitarian crises since World 
War II and has generated a vast outflow of nearly 5 million refugees 
from Syria. The United States has taken only around 15,000 Syrian 
refugees, amounting to a tiny 0.2 percent of the total number of 
refugees, the large majority of whom are women and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Not only are these Syrian refugees not terrorists, but they are 
fleeing the brutal state terrorism of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-
Assad and the brutal non-state terrorism of ISIS. The Syrian refugees 
entering the states are the victims of terrorism, not the perpetrators 
of terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Also, any ISIS terrorist with an ounce of common sense is quite 
unlikely to try to infiltrate the United States as a Syrian refugee. 
Anne Richard, a senior U.S. State Department official, testified at a 
Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing in November 2015 that any 
Syrian refugee trying to get into the United States is scrutinized by 
officials from the National Counterterrorism Center, FBI, Department of 
Homeland Security, State Department and Pentagon. They must also give 
up their biometric data--scans of their retinas, for instance--submit 
their detailed biographic histories and submit to lengthy interviews. 
These refugees are also queried against a number of government data 
bases to see if they might pose a threat--and the whole process takes 2 
years, sometimes more. Leon Rodriguez, the director of U.S. Citizenship 
and Immigration Services, who also testified at the November 2015 
hearing, said that of all the tens of millions of people who are trying 
to get into the United States every year, ``Refugees get the most 
scrutiny and Syrian refugees get the most scrutiny of all.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">By contrast, Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe do not go through 
anything like the rigorous process experienced by those who are coming 
to the States, and the volume of Syrians fleeing to Europe is orders of 
magnitude larger than it is to the United States.
The Trump administration's own data on anti-Western terror attacks</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">undermines the case for the travel ban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Earlier this month with great fanfare the White House released a 
list of 78 terrorist attacks around the world since September 2014. A 
White House official described them as ``major terrorist attacks 
targeting the West.'' The list was released after President Trump's 
claim that the media is not paying enough attention to terrorist 
attacks, a contention that is false. In fact, with a search of the 
Nexis media database I found more than 80,000 stories about the 
purportedly under-covered 78 terrorist attacks, an average of 1,000 
stories per attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The White House's own terrorism list underlines the arbitrary 
nature of the proposed travel ban because, by the White House's own 
account, the countries that are generating the most significant number 
of terrorists threatening the West are from the West. The list also 
underlines the fact that it is American citizens who largely foment 
terrorism in the United States. This is also the case in countries such 
as France and Belgium, where it is French and Belgian citizens who are 
most often the ones conducting significant acts of terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Conspicuous by their absence on the White House list of terrorists 
carrying out major attacks against Western targets were Iraqis, 
Somalis, Sudanese, and Yemenis, who are from four of the seven Muslim 
countries that the Trump administration is seeking to suspend travel 
from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Of the total of 90 terrorists on the White House list, at most 9 
are from travel ban countries. Indeed, 50 of the terrorists--more than 
half--are from Christian-majority countries in the West. On the list, 
which includes the identities of attackers where they are known, France 
leads the way with 16 French terrorists, followed by the United States 
with 13 American terrorists, 11 of whom are U.S. citizens and two of 
whom are legal permanent residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Of these 29 American and French terrorists, only two even have 
family origins in travel ban countries and they are both from Somalia. 
Belgium comes in third place with seven terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In descending order after that are:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Tunisians (6),
  &lt;bullet&gt; Libyans and Bangladeshis are tied with 5,
  &lt;bullet&gt; Saudis (4),
  &lt;bullet&gt; Syrians, Algerians, and Indonesians are tied with 3 each;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Afghans, Australians, Bosnians, Canadians, Danes, Germans,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Russians, and Turks are tied with two each, and
  &lt;bullet&gt; One each from Chad, Egypt, the Emirates, Iran, Morocco, the</paragraph>

Attacks Inspired by ISIS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In the past 2\1/2\ years, there have been eight ISIS-inspired 
attacks in the United States. The most lethal was in Orlando in June 
2016 when Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a nightclub catering to the 
gay community; it was the deadliest terrorist attack in the States 
since 9/11. In December 2015 a married couple in San Bernardino, 
California attacked an office holiday party and killed 14.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">There have been other ISIS-inspired attacks that were not lethal. 
In the fall of 2014, 32-year-old Zale Thompson attacked police officers 
with a hatchet in New York. Described as an unemployed recluse, 
Thompson is believed to have been inspired by ISIS. In May 2015, gunmen 
inspired by ISIS opened fire at a cartoon contest of the Prophet 
Mohammed held in Garland, Texas. The gunmen, Elton Simpson and Nadir 
Soofi, were killed by police before they could kill anyone. In January 
2016, Edward Archer shot Philadelphia police officer Jesse Hartnett. 
Archer told police, ``I pledge my allegiance to the Islamic State, and 
that's why I did what I did.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">As mentioned above, on September 17, 2016 Dahir Adan, a 20-year-old 
naturalized citizen from Somalia, injured 10 people while wielding a 
knife at a mall in Minnesota and 2 months later Abdul Razak Ali Artan, 
an 18-year-old legal permanent resident of Somali origin injured 11 
people in an attack at Ohio State. Both attackers were inspired by 
Unstable Individuals Adopted by ISIS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Unstable individuals will sometimes carry out attacks with only the 
thinnest veneer of jihadist justification and the attack will be 
quickly adopted by ISIS, even though ISIS had no connection to the plot 
at all. In late August 2016, 20-year-old Wasil Farooqui of Roanoke 
County, Virginia--who had reportedly traveled to Turkey in an apparent 
effort to then cross the border and possibly join ISIS in Syria--
allegedly repeatedly stabbed a randomly selected man and woman in 
Roanoke with a knife, yelling ``Allahu Akbar!'' as he did so, severely 
injuring them. The case is complicated by the fact that Farooqui told a 
detective he was hearing voices telling him that he was stupid and to 
attack someone, which raises the issue of the extent to which some 
``ISIS'' attacks are even really ``terrorism'' in any meaningful sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">This certainly seems to be the case of 31-year-old Tunisian Mohamed 
Lahouaiej Bouhlel who so frightened his own family with his violent 
personality that he was prescribed antipsychotic drugs when he was a 
teenager. Bouhlel never attended his neighborhood mosque, smoked pot, 
drank heavily, ate pork, chased women, and had had a number of run-ins 
with the law for violence. He also beat his wife who then divorced him. 
Bouhlel was so incensed by his wife leaving him that he defecated in 
their apartment. Bouhlel, in short, was a violent loser who may have 
been on the edge of psychosis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">During Bastille Day celebrations on July 14, 2016, Bouhlel killed 
84 in Nice, France using a large truck as a weapon. ISIS' overseer of 
operations in the West, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani had called for attacks 
using vehicles as weapons 2 years earlier. After Bouhlel's massacre, 
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls astutely observed that ISIS ``gives 
unstable individuals an ideological kit that allows them to make sense 
of their acts.'' This echoed the conclusions of leading American 
forensic psychologist Reid Meloy, who together with his British 
colleague Jessica Yakeley published a 2014 study of terrorists with no 
connections to formal terrorist organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Meloy, who works as a consultant with the FBI's behavioral 
analysts, framed the initial stage leading to violence as 
``grievance,'' and his explanation of what that meant is worth quoting 
at length, as it nicely summarizes Bouhlel's rancor. According to 
Meloy, the pathway begins with ``an event or series of events that 
involve loss and often humiliation of the subject, his or her continual 
rumination about the loss, and the blaming of others. Most people with 
grievances eventually grieve their loss, but for those unwilling or 
unable to do so, often the most narcissistically sensitive individuals, 
it is much easier to convert their shame into rage toward the object 
which they believe is the cause of all their suffering. Such intense 
grievances require that individuals take no personal responsibility for 
their failures in life . . . they are `injustice collectors.' ''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">What follows this stage, Meloy explains, is ``moral outrage'': ``He 
embeds his personal grievance in an historical, religious, or political 
cause or event. The suffering of others, which may be misperceived or 
actual, provides emotional fuel for his personal grievance.'' Personal 
grievance and moral outrage are then ``framed by an ideology.'' The 
nature of the ideology is secondary; its function is to allow the 
perpetrator some justification for the violent act he is planning. 
Meloy explained, ``Upon closer examination, these conscious belief 
systems are quite superficial; subjects will cherry pick phrases from 
the relevant authoritative text to justify their desire to kill others 
. . . This framing is absolutist and simplistic, providing a clarity 
that both rationalizes behavior and masks other, more personal 
grievances.''
A Case Study: The Orlando Terrorist</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">This is also a good description of how the Orlando terrorist, Omar 
Mateen, took his personal grievances and framed them around the 
ideology of ISIS so that he was no longer the disappointed wannabe cop 
in a dead-end job that he actually was, but by pledging himself to ISIS 
as he carried out his massacre he was now a heroic holy warrior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The attack in Orlando fit a grim pattern: Every lethal jihadist 
terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade-and-a-half has 
been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, 
operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal 
connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda 
or ISIS. Because 19 Arab, foreign-born terrorists carried out 9/11 many 
Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are 
carried out by foreigners, rather than by United States citizens, but 
Omar Mateen was an American citizen who was born in New York to parents 
who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Mateen is similar to other jihadist terrorists in the States since 
9/11. According to research by New America, there have been more than 
350 jihadist terrorism cases in the United States since the 2001 
attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The militants are 
overwhelmingly American citizens or legal residents; around 84 percent. 
The perpetrators are not the young hotheads of popular imagination. The 
individuals in these cases have an average age of 29, a third are 
married and a third have children. In many ways, they are ordinary 
Americans. Mateen was 29 when he carried out the attack, had been 
married twice and had a 3-year-old son. He was steadily employed as a 
security guard at a local golf resort. He had no criminal convictions, 
and there is no evidence he suffered from mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In his case, as in so many others of the 399 Americans charged 
since 9/11 with some act of jihadist terrorism--ranging from material 
support of a terrorist group to murder--the easy explanations--that 
jihadists in the United States are ``mad'' or ``bad''--are not 
supported by the evidence. According to research by New America, the 
rate of mental illness for those Americans who have been charged or 
convicted for some kind of jihadist crime--about 11 percent--is below 
the rate of the general population, while their incarceration rate is 
similar to the incarceration rate of the general population of adult 
males; around 10 percent of American males spend time in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Even in the cases of the dozen perpetrators who carried out the ten 
lethal jihadist terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 only 
three of the terrorists had a history of mental illness; Naveed Azfal 
Haq who killed a woman at the Jewish Federation building in Seattle in 
2006 and Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez who killed four Marines and a 
sailor at two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2015. 
In August 2016, a judge ruled that Alton Nolen, who beheaded a coworker 
in Oklahoma in September 2014, was not competent to plead guilty after 
hearing testimony from mental health experts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Of course, killing strangers in the service of jihadist ideology 
isn't ``normal,'' but the large majority of the 12 jihadist terrorists 
in the States since 9/11 who have carried out lethal attacks were not 
suffering from a mental illness when they carried out their assaults. 
The National Institute of Mental Health says that around one in five 
Americans have some kind of mental illness in any given year. The 
sample size of 12 lethal jihadist terrorists in the States since 9/11 
is a very small one, but their rate of mental illness--one in five--is 
that of the general population. (By contrast, a 2013 study of 119 
individuals who carried out or planned to carry out acts of lone-actor 
terrorism either in the United States or in Europe since 1990--
motivated by a wide range of political beliefs including jihadism, neo-
Nazism, anti-government extremism and those with idiosyncratic 
ideologies--found that a third had a history of mental illness or 
personality disorders.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">For the book United States of Jihad: Investigating America's 
Homegrown Terrorists, I reviewed court records in hundreds of terrorism 
cases and spoke to family members and friends of terrorists, as well as 
to some of the militants themselves. I found that American jihadists 
are generally motivated by a mix of factors, including dislike of 
United States foreign policy in the Muslim world; a ``cognitive 
opening'' to militant Islam, often precipitated by a personal 
disappointment or loss; and the desire to attach themselves to an 
ideology or organization that could give them a sense of purpose. For 
many, embracing the ideology of Osama bin Laden or ISIS allowed them to 
become the heroes of their own story as well as actors in a cosmic 
crusade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">For each individual terrorist the proportion of these motivations 
varied. For instance, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older of the two brothers 
who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was a non-
practicing Muslim who became an Islamist militant once his dreams of 
becoming an Olympic boxer faded. At the time of the attack, he was 
unemployed. For him, bombing the marathon seemed to allow him to become 
the heroic figure that he believed himself to be. On the other hand, 
his younger brother, Dzhokhar, never seemed to embrace militant Islam. 
He smoked marijuana, drank and chased girls--hardly the actions of a 
Muslim fundamentalist. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's motivations for the bombings 
were instead largely molded by his older brother, whom he admired and 
feared, and by his own half-baked opposition to American foreign 
policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Nidal Hasan, the Army major, who killed 13 people at Fort Hood, 
Tex., in 2009, seemed to be more of an ideologue. He was a highly 
observant Muslim who objected to American foreign policy. But according 
to Nader Hasan, a first cousin who had grown up with him, the massacre 
at Fort Hood was also motivated by Nidal Hasan's personal problems. He 
was unmarried, his parents were dead, he had no real friends and a 
dreaded deployment to Afghanistan loomed. ``He went postal,'' Nader 
Hasan explained, ``and he called it Islam.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">These stories underline how hard it is to satisfactorily answer the 
question of why terrorists commit heinous crimes. Human motivations are 
complex. As the philosopher Immanuel Kant observed, ``From the crooked 
timber of humanity not a straight thing was ever made.'' It's a useful 
reminder that human beings, including terrorists, often defy neat 
categorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Omar Mateen's motivations, too, seem to have been multi-layered, 
and will probably never be fully explicable. Mateen himself offered one 
inspiration: ISIS. In a 
9-1-1 call he made from the nightclub as he was carrying out his 
massacre, Mateen pledged himself to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 
Yet a more complex stew of personal traits, resentments, and obsessions 
also propelled him toward violence. As a child Mateen was angry and 
disruptive in class, and at age 14 he was expelled from high school for 
fighting. On the morning of the 9/11 attacks, Mateen told classmates 
that Osama bin Laden was his uncle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">As an adult, relatives say Mateen expressed homophobic views, while 
coworkers remember that he claimed to have connections to both al-Qaeda 
and Hezbollah, groups that are at war with each other. His first wife 
says he was abusive and couldn't control his temper, while there are 
suggestions that he might have been confused about his sexual identity. 
Mateen's reported use of gay dating apps and visits to the Pulse 
nightclub in the months before the attack make this a tempting central 
narrative--self-loathing for his own homosexuality turned violent--but 
these behaviors are also consistent with the careful planning of 
predatory murderers. In the weeks after the massacre FBI investigators 
concluded that there was no evidence Mateen had had a gay relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Mateen was certainly, however, a man whose dreams had faded. He 
desperately wanted to be a cop and took selfies wearing New York Police 
Department shirts, but he was dismissed from a Florida police-training 
academy in 2007 because he threatened to bring a gun to campus and was 
falling asleep in class. Eight years later, in 2015, Mateen tried once 
again to become a police officer, applying to the police academy at 
Indian River State College in Fort Pierce. He was turned down because 
he admitted to using marijuana in the past and also because of what the 
college termed ``discrepancies'' in his application form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Mateen's grievances festered. Three weeks before his attack, one of 
the leaders of ISIS publicly urged that sympathizers of the group 
should carry out attacks in the West during the coming holy month of 
Ramadan. By following this directive, carrying out an attack as a self-
styled ``Islamic fighter'' pledging allegiance to ISIS, Mateen was 
finally the heroic holy warrior that he believed himself to be. A day 
after the massacre ISIS's official radio station, Al-Bayan, claimed him 
as one of the ``soldiers of the caliphate in America.'' But Mateen's 
connection to ISIS was only aspirational; he wasn't trained, directed, 
or financed by the group. Instead he was, like every other jihadist in 
the States since 9/11 that has carried out a lethal attack, operating 
as a self-radicalized ``lone wolf.''
Attacks Enabled by ISIS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Militants inspired by ISIS can reach out directly to members of 
ISIS in Syria over encrypted social media platforms seeking some kind 
of specific directions for an attack. This creates a ``blended'' plot 
that is both inspired and directed by ISIS. In FBI terminology this is 
an ``enabled'' ISIS attack. We already saw a harbinger of this in May 
2015 when one of the two ISIS-inspired American militants who attacked 
the Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, sent more than 
100 encrypted messages to a terrorist overseas, according to the FBI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">4. who are isis' american recruits?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">There are 117 individuals in the United States that New America has 
identified in public records or news accounts that have tried to join 
militant groups in Syria such as ISIS or the al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra 
Front, or have succeeded in joining such groups, or have helped others 
to join such groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">They hail from across the United States and from a wide range of 
ethnic groups, which underscores the difficulty that law enforcement 
has in tracking them. They are relatively young; some are even 
teenagers. Given the fact that groups like ISIS have scant roles for 
women outside the home, women are surprisingly well-represented. These 
militants are also quite active on social media. This is something of a 
boon for law enforcement, as many of these militants are prolific 
posters on publicly available social media, which it is perfectly legal 
for the FBI and police departments to monitor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The 117 are residents of 23 States: Alabama, Arizona, California, 
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and 
Wisconsin. There is no single ethnic profile for these militants: They 
are white, African-American, Somali-American, Vietnamese-American, 
Bosnian-American and Arab-American, among other ethnicities and 
nationalities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">An unprecedented number of American women are involved in the 
Syrian jihad compared to other such jihads in the past. One in nine of 
the 117 Americans involved in Syria-related militant activity are 
women. Women were rarely present, if at all, among jihadists in 
previous ``holy wars''--in Afghanistan against the Soviets in the 
1980's, in Bosnia against the Serbs in the 1990's, and the initial 
insurgency in Iraq against the United States-led occupation more than a 
decade ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">They're relatively young. Almost a fifth are teenagers--including 
six teenage girls, the youngest of whom is 15. New America found that 
the average age of the militants is 25.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The only profile that ties together American militants drawn to the 
Syrian conflict is that they are active in on-line jihadist circles. 
Eighty-eight of the 117 individuals showed a pattern of often 
downloading and sharing jihadist propaganda on-line and, in a smaller 
number of cases, carrying on on-line conversations with militants 
abroad. Militants in the United States today become radicalized after 
reading and interacting with propaganda on-line and many have little or 
no physical interaction with other extremists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Social media has dramatically accelerated this trend. Of the 117 
individual cases that New America examined, there were no clear cases 
of physical recruitment by a militant operative, radical cleric, or 
returning fighter from Syria. Instead, people self-recruited on-line or 
were sometimes in touch via Twitter with members of ISIS they had never 
met in person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">A representative case is that of 19-year-old Mohammed Hamzah Khan 
of suburban Chicago. In the late summer of 2014, he purchased three 
airline tickets for flights from Chicago to Istanbul for himself and 
his 17-year-old sister and 16-year-old brother (who have not been named 
publicly because they were minors). Khan had met someone on-line who 
had provided him with the number of a contact to call once he had 
landed in Istanbul who would help to get him and his siblings to the 
Turkish-Syrian border, and from there on to a region occupied by ISIS. 
Khan planned to serve in the group's police force. Before leaving, Khan 
wrote a 3-page letter to his parents explaining why he was leaving 
Chicago to join ISIS. He told them that ISIS had established the 
perfect Islamic State and that he felt obligated to ``migrate'' there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">According to prosecutors, the three teenagers planned to meet up in 
Turkey with a shadowy ISIS recruiter they had met on-line, known as Abu 
Qa'qa, and travel with him, most likely to ISIS headquarters in Raqqa, 
Syria. They didn't make it. FBI agents arrested Khan and his two 
siblings at O'Hare Airport in October 2014.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">There is no evidence that Khan planned to commit any act of 
terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, and he failed in his goal 
of reaching ISIS, but he faced up to 15 years in prison for attempting 
to provide ``material support'' to ISIS in the form of his own 
potential ``services.'' He has pled guilty and Federal prosecutors have 
argued for a 5-year sentence in which he must continue to cooperate 
with them.
How Does ISIS Crowd Source Jihad in the States?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">As FBI director James Comey noted when referring to the 2013 arrest 
of Terry Loewen, who was accused of plotting an attack on the Wichita 
airport in Kansas, ``We have made it so hard for people to get into 
this country, bad guys, but they can enter as a photon and radicalize 
somebody in Wichita, Kansas.'' The ``photon'' Comey was talking about 
was, of course, the internet. The only profile that tied together 
American militants drawn to the Syrian conflict is that they were 
active in on-line jihadist circles. More than three-quarters were 
posters of jihadist material on Twitter or Facebook, or were in direct 
contact with ISIS recruiters over social media.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">This raises the question of how we should conceptualize lone wolves 
in the age of social media. A militant radicalizing in front of his or 
her computer by himself at home is now not really alone. He/she is 
swimming in a virtual sea of jihadist recruiters, cheerleaders, and 
fellow travelers who are available for interaction with him or her 24/
7. Contrast this with a classic lone-wolf American terrorist of the 
past such as the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, who mailed his targets more 
than a dozen bombs between the late 1970's and the mid-1990's that 
killed three people and injured some two dozen others, all in service 
of his obscure, Luddite beliefs. Kaczynski did this entirely by himself 
while living like a hermit in a remote cabin in Montana with--forget 
the internet--no electricity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Today's lone wolf is instead plugged into a vast self-referential 
and interactive ecosystem where he or she can virtually, instantly find 
thousands of other people around the world who share his or her 
beliefs. Take the case of Alex, a 23-year-old sometime Sunday school 
teacher living in a remote part of Washington State who converted to 
Islam. In 2015 multiple members and fans of ISIS spent thousands of 
hours on-line with her, promising that they would find her a suitable 
husband and even sending her gifts of chocolate and books about Islam. 
The three teenage Khan siblings from Chicago were in regular contact 
with virtual recruiters in Turkey and Syria and militants in the United 
Kingdom before attempting their emigration to the caliphate in 2014. In 
the useful formulation of the Israeli counterterrorism expert Gabriel 
Weimann, the lone wolf is now part of a virtual pack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">No amount of fiddling with visa regimes will alter the central fact 
that today's jihadist terrorists in the United States are largely 
radicalized on-line while they are living in the States. A travel ban 
is not going to stop the internet.
The Continuing Influence of Anwar al-Awlaki</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Lost in the intense coverage of the ISIS-inspired threat in the 
States is the continuing influence of the American-born cleric Anwar 
al-Awlaki whose sermons and writings about the importance of jihad have 
appeared in 98 jihadist terrorism cases since 9/11, according to New 
America's research. Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in Yemen in 
2011, but killing the man turned out to be easier than killing his 
ideas; Since his death Awlaki's writings and videos have turned up in 
58 terrorism cases in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">5. isis in retreat</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">ISIS has lost just under half the territory it once controlled in 
Iraq and around a fifth of what it had controlled in Syria. In the past 
year ISIS has lost the key Iraqi cities of Baiji, Fallujah, Ramadi and 
Tikrit, as well as Palmyra in Syria. In August 2016 ISIS lost the city 
of Manbij, in northern Syria, a significant victory because it controls 
key routes to ISIS' de facto Syrian capital, Raqqa. ISIS fighters 
disobeyed orders to fight to the death to hold Manbij and fled. The 
same month the Turkish army crossed the border and seized the Syrian 
city of Jarablus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In August 2016 Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, who was leading the anti-
ISIS campaign at the time, said 45,000 ISIS fighters had been killed so 
far by the U.S.-led coalition. ``We estimate that over the past 11 
months, we've killed about 25,000 enemy fighters. When you add that to 
the 20,000 estimated killed (previously), that's 45,000 enemy 
(fighters) taken off the battlefield.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">That's an astonishing amount of attrition for a force MacFarland 
estimates had a remaining strength of 15,000 to 30,000 fighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">United States intelligence estimates the U.S.-led coalition has 
also killed at least 135 of ISIS leaders and significant officials, 
including in late August Mohammad al-Adnani, who oversaw the group's 
terrorist operations in the West. The United States military has also 
stepped up the air campaign against ISIS' wealth, for instance, bombing 
a bank in Iraq in January 2016 in which ISIS had stored millions in 
cash. United States bombers have also repeatedly struck trucks carrying 
oil that ISIS has extracted from oil fields in the shrinking area it 
now controls. These attacks on ISIS' cash supply and revenue streams 
have had real effects on ISIS' bottom line. ISIS has had to halve the 
salaries of its foot soldiers, according to documents that leaked from 
the terrorist army in 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">These massive losses of territory and income have had a very 
damaging effect on ISIS' central claims; that it has created a real 
caliphate that controls large amounts of territory and that it 
functions like a normal state. As the caliphate withers so too does its 
appeal to ``foreign fighters'' from around the Muslim world. This is a 
key to undermining ISIS as the foreign fighters are often the most 
ideological of the organization's cadre and, as the coalition continues 
to kill on average 2,000 ISIS fighters a month, the terrorist army is 
finding it harder and harder to replenish its ranks, an indicator of 
which is that it is increasingly resorting to using children as suicide 
attackers. In April 2016 the Pentagon said that the flow of foreign 
fighters joining ISIS had dropped from roughly 1,500 a month down to 
200 within the past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Meanwhile, the flow of Americans going to join ISIS or attempting 
to do so has slowed to a trickle from an average of six to one a month, 
according to U.S. intelligence estimates. Balanced against all this, of 
course, is the fact that the terrorist group has launched attacks or 
inspired them in places as disparate as Baghdad, Brussels, Istanbul, 
Kabul, Nice, Orlando, and Paris in the past year-and-a-half. The 
terrorism research group, IntelCenter, also counts 43 ISIS affiliates 
of various kinds around the world. Some have declared their ``support'' 
for ISIS, while others have declared their ``allegiance.'' Some of 
these affiliates may have simply slapped on the ISIS patch, but others 
clearly have some real connection with the ISIS core, such as the ISIS 
affiliate in Libya, which is the affiliate that is most tightly bound 
to the ISIS core.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">That said, ISIS core continues to suffer reverse after reverse on 
the battlefield, while ISIS in Libya has suffered similar battlefield 
reverses to that of ISIS' core, losing control of the key coastal city 
of Sirte in Libya in August 2016, which had served as the group's key 
hub in Libya.
The Continued Resilience of al-Qaeda</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">A decade-and-a-half after 9/11 al-Qaeda has shown surprising 
resiliency despite the heavy losses it has sustained, including of its 
founder Osama bin Laden as we all as dozens of other al-Qaeda leaders 
killed in CIA drones strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. While al-Qaeda has 
shown scant ability to attack in the West--the last successful 
terrorist attack it directed in the West was the suicide bombings on 
London's transportation system in 2005 that killed more than 50 
commuters--its regional affiliates remain quite capable of sustained 
attacks in their respective regions. Al-Qaeda in the Indian 
Subcontinent, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and al-Qaeda in the 
Islamic Maghreb all retain capacity for sustained local attacks. 
Meanwhile the Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's capable Syrian affiliate, claimed 
in July 2016 that it was separating from al-Qaeda. Then-Director of 
National Intelligence, James Clapper, said that Nusra likely announced 
its divorce from al-Qaeda's core for tactical reasons and the split was 
only cosmetic in nature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Al-Qaeda is grooming one of bin Laden's sons, Hamza, to be a next 
generation leader of the group. Hamza, in his mid-20's, has long been 
an al-Qaeda true believer. He has appeared in a number of videos and 
audio messages that were released by al-Qaeda in the past year or so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Omar Abdel-Rahman, the Egyptian cleric who inspired terrorist plots 
in New York during the early 1990's and who died in an American prison 
last week, was also the spiritual guide of key 9/11 plotters. Rahman's 
death in an American jail will almost certainly spark calls from al-
Qaeda's current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, for further anti-American 
attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">6. the drivers of global jihadism</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">At the macro level, ISIS is not itself the problem--though it 
certainly amplifies existing problems--but rather is the symptom of 
five major problems that are driving jihadist terrorism around the 
globe and will continue to do so even when ISIS is largely defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">1. The regional civil war in the Middle East between the Sunni and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">the Shia that engulfed first Iraq, then Syria, and now Yemen.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">That regional civil war is being driven by a variety of factors</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">including the failure of the largely Shia Iraqi government to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">give Sunnis a real place at the table and the brutal civil war</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">that the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad is waging on his</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">largely Sunni population. Also in the mix is the role that Iran</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">and the Gulf States have played in fighting each other in Syria</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">through proxy forces such as the Sunni militant groups that are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">supported by the Gulf States and the Shia militias that are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">supported by Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">This regional sectarian war was amplified by Saudi Arabia's</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">invasion of Yemen in the spring of 2015 to fight what they</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">believe to be Iranian-backed Houthis who had recently seized</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">control of the Yemeni capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The civil war across the Middle East between the Shia and the Sunni</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">empowers groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda who claim to be the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">defenders of Sunni rights against Shia attack. Until there is</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">real political accommodation between the Sunnis and the Shia in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">countries such as Iraq, Syria, and Yemen and some kind of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">rapprochement between the mortal enemies of Iran and Saudi</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Arabia, these sectarian wars will grind on. Don't, however,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">expect such an accommodation in the short- or medium-term. The</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Syrian civil war is already in its sixth year and the principal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">players in the conflict both inside Syria and outside of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">country show no sign of setting up a real peace process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">2. The collapse of Arab governance around the region.--Think of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">ISIS as a pathogen that preys on weak hosts in the Muslim</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">world. In fact, there is something of a political law: The</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">weaker a Muslim state, the stronger will be the presence of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">ISIS or like-minded groups. So, in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Yemen--countries that are completely failed states or are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">largely failing states--the presence of these groups is strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In Muslim countries with somewhat competent governments such as</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Indonesia, the presence of these groups is relatively small.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">3. Unprecedented waves of immigration to Europe from the Muslim</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">world.--Germany alone has taken more than a million refugees</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">and asylum seekers. European countries simply do not have the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">ideological framework the United States has in the shape of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">``American Dream'' that has helped to absorb successfully wave</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">after wave of immigration to the States, including Muslim</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Americans who are well integrated into American society. There</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">is no analogous French dream or German dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">4. The rise of European ultranationalist and protofascist parties,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">a problem amplified by the massive immigration from Muslim</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">countries into Europe.--These parties define themselves as</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">deeply opposed to immigrants and are ultranationalist in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">flavor. They once played a very marginal role in European</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">politics, but now these parties are now doing well in Austria,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">France, Hungary, Poland, and Switzerland. The rise of these</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">parties is reflective of the rising anti-immigrant sentiment in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">many European societies that in turn amplifies the feelings of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">alienation that many Muslims feel in Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">5. The marginalization of Muslims in Europe who often live separate</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">and unequal lives.--An indication of how marginalized European</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Muslims are is provided by the following bleak statistics: The</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">proportion of the French prison population that is Muslim is</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">estimated to be around 60 percent, yet Muslims only account for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">about 8 percent of France's total population. In Belgian</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">prisons there is a similar story: 30 percent of the prison</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">population is Muslim, yet Muslims only make up 6 percent of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">overall population. It's therefore not surprising that French</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">and Belgian prisons have proven to be universities of jihad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The members of the ISIS cell responsible for the attacks in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Paris in November that killed 130 and the attacks in March 2016</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">in Brussels, Belgium, at the airport and on the subway system</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">that killed 32, bonded through criminal activities or in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">prison. Abdelhamid Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam, the cell's</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">masterminds, were childhood friends who grew up in the Brussels</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">neighborhood of Molenbeek. In 2010, the men were arrested and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">spent time in the same prison. Ibrahim Abdeslam, Salah's</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">brother, also spent time in prison with Abaaoud. He would go on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">to be one of the terrorists in the November Paris attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Khalid and Ibrahim El Bakraoui, both suicide bombers in the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Brussels attacks, had served lengthy prison sentences for armed</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">robbery and assault on police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Muslim citizens in France are 2\1/2\ times less likely to be called 
for a job interview than a similar Christian candidate, according to 
researchers at Stanford University. Many French Muslims live in grim 
banlieues, the suburbs of large French cities (similar to housing 
projects in the United States), where they find themselves largely 
divorced from mainstream French society. According to the 
Renseignements Generaux, a police agency that monitors militants in 
France, half the neighborhoods with a high Muslim population are 
isolated from French social and political life. The French term for 
these neighborhoods is equivalent to ``sensitive urban zones,'' where 
youth unemployment can be as high as 45 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">None of these five problems is easily solvable and they feed into 
ISIS' narrative that Muslims are under attack by the West and also by 
the Shia as well as by any Muslim who doesn't share their extremist 
ideology. If these problems cannot be ameliorated--and in the short 
term many of them will not be ameliorated--the West will be confronted 
by a son of ISIS and, down the line, a grandson of ISIS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">7. emerging trends in terrorism
1. Terrorists Merging with Media</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In 1985, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher spoke about 
terrorism at the annual convention of the American Bar Association. 
Following a recent high-profile hijacking of a TWA passenger plane 
forced to land in Beirut that had received lavish media coverage, 
Thatcher urged that news organizations ``must try to find ways to 
starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on 
which they depend.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">It's a dilemma that news organizations have grappled with for many 
decades since. Terrorist attacks are, of course, news, but terrorists 
also depend on ``the oxygen of publicity'' provided by the media to 
spread accounts of their violence. But what happens when today's 
terrorists are the media? In the past, terrorists had to rely on the 
media to get their messages out, but now they can completely control 
their own message, from making their own content to ensuring its 
widespread distribution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In a new twist of the past 3 years, ISIS and other jihadist 
militants are also now reporting on their own bloody work in real time. 
Consider that ISIS produces lavish TV productions, filmed 
professionally in high definition--of everything from its murder of 
civilians, to profiles of its heroic fighters, to the supposedly 
idyllic life that can be lived under its purportedly utopian rule. The 
group also has its own de facto news agency, Amaq, that credibly 
reports on ISIS' own atrocities. ISIS also publishes multiple webzines 
in English, French, Russian, and Turkish. Most strikingly, terrorist 
organizations and their supporters maintain many tens of thousands of 
accounts on social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, 
which they use to further propagate the ISIS message. More and more, 
those accounts are documenting and broadcasting terrorist violence, as 
it plays out live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">When ISIS militants took hostages at the upscale cafe in Dhaka, 
Bangladesh in June 2016 and killed 20 mostly non-Muslim foreigners, at 
the same time they also sent images of their victims lying in pools of 
blood to the ISIS new agency, Amaq, which posted them for the world to 
see. Similarly, the same month Larossi Abballa, an ISIS-inspired 
militant, killed a police official and his partner outside of Paris. 
Immediately after the murders, Abballa videotaped himself live on 
Facebook declaring his allegiance to ISIS. While Abballa was taping 
this statement, near him was the couple's terrified 3-year-old son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Meanwhile, pledging allegiance to ISIS on Facebook after a 
murderous attack has now become almost routine for terrorists in the 
West. Omar Mateen, the terrorist in Orlando who killed 49 at a gay 
nightclub, pledged his allegiance to ISIS on Facebook as he carried out 
his attack. So, too, did the terrorists in San Bernardino in December 
who killed 14 attending an office holiday party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">One of the big ideas of modern terrorism, from the Munich Olympics 
of 1972 during which Palestinian terrorists kidnapped Israeli athletes 
to 9/11, has been to use wide-spread TV coverage of violent acts to 
propagate and advance the political ideas of the militants. Today, 
terrorists bypass traditional media entirely and they now act 
simultaneously as the protagonists, producers, and propagators of their 
acts of nihilistic violence.
2. Terrorist Groups with Armed Drones</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Hezbollah, the militant Shiite group that is headquartered in 
Lebanon, armed drones, combined with fire from Hezbollah ground troops, 
killed 23 Nusra militants and wounded some 10 others, according to a 
report by an Iranian news agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Iran is the key sponsor for Hezbollah and has plausibly claimed for 
the past several years to manufacture armed drones. Hezbollah's use of 
drones marks a milestone for terrorist groups world-wide: It would be 
the first time a group other than a nation-state used armed drones 
successfully to carry out an attack, marking an important step toward 
closing the gap between the drone capabilities of countries such as the 
United States and militant groups such as Hezbollah. After all, it was 
only in the months immediately after 9/11 that the United States 
mastered the technology of arming drones and began to use them in 
combat. In August 2016 Hezbollah also released video on-line showing 
what appears to be a commercial drone dropping small bombs on rebel 
positions in Aleppo, Syria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Previously, drones were used by militant groups only for 
surveillance purposes. In August 2014 ISIS uploaded a video to YouTube 
that showed aerial views of Syrian Army Military Base 93 in Raqqa 
province in northern Syria that had been shot by a drone. In the past 
year ISIS has used small armed drones for combat missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">ISIS use of armed drones shows how warfare is changing: The 
monopoly of states on the use of military force is eroding, and new 
technology is leveling the playing field between states and militant 
groups. So what can the United States and other nations do to protect 
themselves from this dawning threat? Most armed drones are relatively 
easy to shoot down if you have sophisticated air defenses or a fleet of 
jet fighter aircraft. Western countries generally have these, but one 
can imagine a dystopian future where terrorist groups are able to 
deploy armed drones against less well-defended targets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">This may be particularly a problem for U.S. embassies, which are 
well-defended against vehicle-borne bombs, but not against armed 
drones.
3. The Insider Threat at Airports</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The bomb smuggled aboard the Metrojet flight that killed 224 by an 
ISIS-recruited insider at Sharm el-Sheikh airport in Sinai in October 
2015 raised the question: Could such an insider attack happen in the 
West? Short answer: It isn't out of the question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Five American citizens involved in serious terrorist crimes since 
9/11 have worked at major United States airports in a variety of 
capacities. They were recruited by variously ISIS; al-Shabaab; a 
virulent ``home-grown'' jihadist cell based in California; and another 
such group in New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In the years after 9/11, Kevin Lamar James was jailed in 
California's Folsom prison where he formed a group that he conceived of 
as ``al-Qaeda in America.'' James recruited others to help him with his 
plans. One of them was 21-year-old Gregory Vernon Patterson who had 
recently worked at a duty-free shop at Los Angeles International 
Airport (LAX). James thought that Patterson's inside knowledge of LAX 
would be helpful for his plans and when he made a list of potential 
targets in California, James listed LAX. James' crew planned to attack 
around the fourth anniversary of 9/11. They financed their activities 
by sticking up gas stations and their plans only came to light during 
the course of a routine investigation of a gas station robbery by 
police in Torrance, California, who found documents that laid out the 
group's plans for jihadist mayhem. Members of the California cell are 
now serving long prison terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">On October 29, 2008, Shirwa Ahmed became one of the first Americans 
ever to conduct a suicide attack anywhere in the world when he was 
recruited by al-Shabaab to drive a truck loaded with explosives into a 
government building in Somalia, blowing himself up and killing 20 other 
people. Ahmed graduated from high school in Minneapolis in 2003 and 
then worked at the Minneapolis airport pushing passengers in 
wheelchairs; it was during this period that he became increasingly 
religious and was recruited by al-Shabaab. Abdisalan Hussein Ali became 
a suicide bomber for al-Shabaab in Somalia in 2011 and had also worked 
at the Minneapolis airport, in a Caribou coffee shop. Similarly, 
Abdirahmaan Muhumed, who was killed in 2014 while fighting for ISIS in 
Syria, had worked at the Minneapolis airport, where he had a security 
clearance that gave him access to the tarmac and to planes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The problem of militants working at airports and airlines is not 
peculiar only to the States. In the past decade, British citizens 
working at Heathrow and at British Airways have conspired with members 
of al-Qaeda. In the United Kingdom, British Airways IT expert Rajib 
Karim, 31, conspired with al-Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen to place a bomb 
on a United States-bound plane. In 2010, one of the leaders of al-
Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate, Anwar al-Awlaki, wrote an email to Karim 
asking ``Is it possible to get a package or a person with a package on-
board a flight heading to the US?'' Karim replied: ``I do not know much 
about US I can work with the bros to find out the possibilities of 
shipping a package to a US-bound plane.'' Karim had applied for cabin-
crew training before he was arrested and was sentenced to 30 years in 
2011. In 2006, an employee at a shop in Heathrow working on the 
``airside'' post-security section of the airport provided advice about 
the security conditions to self-proclaimed al-Qaeda terrorist Sohail 
Qureshi, who was convicted of multiple terrorism charges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson 
announced in June 2015 that he was implementing new measures to 
``address the potential insider threat'' by mandating biannual 
background checks for workers at United States airports, while also 
requiring airports to reduce the number of access points to secured 
areas and to increase randomized screening of airport employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">These are welcome developments, but the real vulnerabilities exist 
in some of the 103 countries that send direct flights to the United 
States.
4. Bleed out of ISIS ``Foreign Fighters'' from Syria</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The likely defeat of ISIS on the battlefield raises the question: 
What to do about ISIS foreign fighters who survive? Thousands of 
foreign fighters may melt from the battlefield. Since we know from 
other jihads that these foreign fighters are the likely terrorists of 
tomorrow, Western governments as well as Arab and North African 
governments must think through what they plan to do to track these 
fighters and prevent them from carrying out attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">8. what can be done?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">There seems to be some conceptual confusion in the U.S. Government 
about what ``Countering Violent Extremism'' programs are attempting to 
do: Is it counter-radicalization? Or is it counter-recruitment? 
Counter-radicalization-turning many millions of Muslims around the 
world away from radical ideas--seems both a nebulous mission and one 
that may not be achievable. A far more specific task is trying to stop 
the relatively small number of Muslims who are trying to join ISIS or 
sign up for its ideology from doing so. From an American National 
security perspective that is, after all, what we all want to prevent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Here are 16 things that can be done, and one measure that should 
not be taken.
1. Enlist rather than alienate the Muslim community</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The terrorist attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando touched off a 
furious political debate about how best to safeguard Americans, 
featuring such solutions as shutting off Muslim immigration, but that 
would not do much to deal with the threat because lethal attacks by 
jihadist terrorists in the States since 9/11 have been conducted 
largely by American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">In fact, the real lessons learned should come from the law 
enforcement agencies that have studied jihadist terrorists in depth. A 
very telling indicator of future violence by a terrorist, FBI 
behavioral analysts have found, is what they term ``leakage.'' Leakage 
was first identified by the FBI in 1999 in the context of school 
shootings, emerging from the observation that a student who was going 
to do something violent had often intentionally or unintentionally 
revealed something significant about the impending act, anything from 
confiding in a friend to making ominous ``they'll be sorry'' remarks. 
Leakage is, in short, when a violent perpetrator signals to people in 
his circle that he is planning an act of violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">What was true of school shootings turned out to be true for 
terrorist crimes as well. In an on-going study of some 80 terrorism 
cases in the States since 2009, the FBI found that ``leakage'' happened 
more than 80 percent of the time. Those to whom information was leaked, 
termed ``bystanders,'' were broken down by the FBI into peers, family 
members, authority figures, and strangers. FBI analysts found an 
average of three bystanders per case, and in one case as many as 14. 
Some ``bystanders'' saw radicalization behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Others saw actual plotting and planning, such as the accumulation 
of weapons, self-educating about how to make explosives, or 
preparations to travel overseas for terrorist training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">FBI analysts were dismayed by how common it was for bystanders to 
know that a radicalized individual was up to something yet failed to 
tip off the authorities. Analysts graphed out the bystanders who were 
most likely to come forward with information versus those least likely 
to do so. Peers were aware of the most concerning information, but they 
were the least likely to volunteer it. Family members were often aware 
of both radicalization and planning, but they came forward less often 
than authority figures such as college professors, supervisors, 
military commanders, or clerics. These figures were reasonably likely 
to offer information but were more aware of a suspect's radical 
sympathies than of any actual plotting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Strangers were the most likely to come forward, which could be 
helpful. A tip from a clerk at a New Jersey Circuit City--who in 2005 
was asked to make copies of a videotape on which he saw men shooting 
off weapons and shouting ``Allahu Akbar!''--developed into the case in 
which a group of six men were convicted for plotting an attack to kill 
soldiers at the Fort Dix, New Jersey, army base. However, strangers 
made up only 5 percent of the bystanders with useful information about 
a suspect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The importance of the information that a peer can have was 
underlined by the terrorist attack in San Bernardino in which 14 people 
were killed by the married couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen 
Malik. Farook's friend, Enrique Marquez provided the two semiautomatic 
rifles that Farook and his wife used in the massacre. Marquez also knew 
that Farook was planning to carry out some kind of terrorist attack as 
early as 2011. Marquez pled guilty earlier this month to a variety of 
Federal crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The lesson of the FBI study of terrorism cases is that the most 
useful information comes from peers and family members. That's why 
community outreach to Muslim communities to enlist their help in 
detecting those who may be becoming militant is the most fruitful 
approach to dealing with the scourge of terrorism. This is the opposite 
approach from painting all Muslim immigrants as potential terrorists.
2. Either through electronic warfare or other means, take out ISIS'</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">propaganda production facilities in the Middle East</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">ISIS announced its involvement in the attack in June at the cafe in 
Dhaka, Bangladesh, that killed 20 through Amaq, which is effectively 
ISIS' news agency. Why does Amaq continue to exist? Also, ISIS 
continues to pump out on-line videos, audios, and webzines. These 
require crude production facilities of some kind. These, too, should be 
eliminated. (Of course, some will argue that there is some intelligence 
value derived from having ISIS propaganda facilities continuing to 
function, but surely that is outweighed by the value of the larger 
enterprise of eliminating ISIS' appeal.)
3. Intensify the military campaign against ISIS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The less the ISIS ``caliphate'' exists as a physical entity, the 
less the group can claim it is the ``Islamic State'' that it purports 
to be. That should involve more United States Special Forces on the 
ground embedded with the Iraqi military as well as other coalition 
forces in Syria and more United States forward air controllers calling 
in close air support strikes for those forces.
4. Institute a no-fly zone in northern Syria, but be aware of how</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">complex that has now become</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">President Trump has often called for safe zones in Syria. This is 
an excellent idea in theory, because this will reduce the battlefield 
success of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is the principal driver 
of the Syrian war and will also reduce the flow of refugees into 
Europe, but, based on multiple discussions with U.S. military officials 
based in the Middle East, implementing such safe zones would be quite 
complex because it would entail a no-fly zone if it had a chance to 
succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">First, appropriate authorities would have to be given to American 
fighter jet pilots to shoot down planes defying the no-fly zone, 
including possibly Russian planes that are also conducting air strikes 
in Syria. Second, complicating matters, some of the planes that the 
Syrian air force flies are the same model as some of the older Russian 
planes that are flying over Syria. Third, Syria has excellent air 
defenses that would have to be taken out. The Russians have deployed 
the SA-23 surface-to-air missile system to Syria, which, according to 
U.S. military officials, is one of the most sophisticated air defense 
systems in the world. Fourth, as a matter of international law a no-fly 
zone in Syria would require some kind of U.N. resolution authorizing it 
and Russia would veto such a measure. In 1999, NATO did impose a no-fly 
zone in Kosovo without seeking a U.N. resolution, in order to carry out 
air strikes on Serbian forces. Trump could do something similar, for 
instance, unilaterally ordering American warplanes to bomb Syrian 
airfields so Assad's warplanes could no longer use them. Of course, 
this would be a significant escalation of America's role in the 
conflict and would also skirt international law.
5. Build a database of all the ``foreign fighters'' who have gone to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Syria to fight for ISIS and the al-Qaeda affiliate there</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">This is one of the recommendations of the House Homeland Security 
Committee's 2015 report on foreign fighters in Syria and it is a very 
good one. How can you prevent an attack by returning foreign fighters 
if you are not cognizant of their names and links to ISIS? Right now, 
Interpol has a list of some 8,000 foreign fighters, but the estimated 
40,000 foreign fighters who have gone to fight in Syria dwarf that.
6. Enlist defectors from ISIS to tell their stories publicly</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Nothing is more powerful than hearing from former members of the 
group that ISIS is not creating an Islamist utopia in the areas it 
controls, but a hell on earth. Reducing the flow of foreign fighters to 
ISIS is a key to reducing ISIS' manpower. Muhammad Jamal Khweis, 26, of 
Alexandria, Virginia, was held by Kurdish fighters after allegedly 
deserting from ISIS in early 2015. Khweis gave an interview to a 
Kurdish TV station in which he said: ``My message to the American 
people is: the life in Mosul [the Iraqi capital of ISIS] it's really, 
really bad. The people [that] were controlling Mosul don't represent 
the religion. Daesh, ISIS, ISIL, they don't represent the religion, I 
don't see them as good Muslims.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">United States prosecutors could throw the book at Khweis for 
joining ISIS, and he could get 20 years or more, but, alternatively, 
they could try something more creative--a deal in which he tells 
prosecutors what he knows about ISIS in return for a reduced prison 
sentence. And one more thing: He would also have to appear before the 
American public, explaining that ISIS is creating hell in the areas it 
controls.
7. Amplify voices such as that of the ISIS opposition group Raqqa is</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Being Slaughtered Silently</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The group routinely posts photos on-line of bread lines in Raqqa, 
the de facto capital of ISIS in northern Syria, and writes about 
electricity shortages in the city. This helps to undercut ISIS 
propaganda that it is a truly functioning state.
8. Support the work of clerics such as Imam Mohamed Magid of northern</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Virginia</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Magid has personally convinced a number of American Muslims seduced 
into support for jihad by ISIS that what the group is doing is contrary 
to the teachings of Islam.
9. Keep up pressure on social media companies such as Twitter to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">enforce their own terms of use to take down any ISIS material</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">that encourages violence</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Since 2015, Twitter has taken down some 360,000 accounts--including 
235,000 accounts in the last 6 months--used by ISIS supporters, but the 
group continues to use Twitter and other social media platforms to 
propagate its message.
10. Amplify support to Turkey to help it to tamp down the foreign</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">fighter flow through their country to ISIS in neighboring Syria</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Turkey, which had long been criticized by Western countries for 
allowing foreign fighters to move through its territory on their way to 
Syria, has clamped down on that traffic into Syria. Those efforts by 
the Turks are paying off, according to ISIS itself. In 2015, ISIS 
posted advice in one of its English-language on-line publications to 
would-be foreign fighters, saying, ``It is important to know that the 
Turkish intelligence agencies are in no way friends of the Islamic 
State [ISIS].''
11. Relentlessly hammer home the message that while ISIS positions</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">itself as the defender of Muslims, its victims are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">overwhelmingly fellow Muslims.
12. No-Fly, No-Buy. Prevent suspected terrorists from buying military-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">style assault rifles</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Astonishingly, over the past decade or so more than 2,000 people 
known or suspected to be terrorists have bought guns and assault 
rifles. Even while suspected jihadist terrorists are under some form of 
FBI investigation, they can easily buy military-style assault weapons. 
Omar Mateen, Nidal Hasan, and Carlos Bledsoe--three of the most 
prominent domestic terrorists since 9/11--were all FBI subjects of 
interest, yet all legally purchased semi-automatic weapons shortly 
before their attacks. If you have been the subject of an FBI terrorism 
inquiry it's obviously absurd that you should be able to legally 
purchase semi-automatic weapons. Congress should pass a law preventing 
this from happening in the future.
13. Stay in Afghanistan</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Afghanistan is going down the tubes and it is in worse shape than 
it has been since 9/11. The Taliban control or contest a third of the 
population. That's 10 million people; more than ISIS controlled at the 
height of its power in the summer of 2014 when it might have controlled 
8 million people at most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">The Obama administration had a counterproductive policy of 
announcing withdrawals from Afghanistan even as it surged troops into 
the country. Exhibit A: the December 1, 2009 speech at West Point where 
Obama announced the surge of troops into Afghanistan and also announced 
their withdrawal date. Of course, that withdrawal date came and went, 
as did a number of others. Constantly announcing proposed withdrawal 
dates for United States forces has enabled the Taliban to believe they 
can simply wait out the clock. It also has contributed to a lack of 
confidence among the Afghan population, 8 out of 10 of whom say that 
the Afghan army and police need support from countries such as the 
United States if they are to do their jobs properly, according to 
polling last year by the Asia Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">It is in American and Afghan interests for the United States to 
stay in Afghanistan so it doesn't turn into Iraq circa 2014 with the 
Taliban controlling much of the country while also hosting a strong 
presence of ISIS and al-Qaeda as well as every other jihadist group of 
note.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">What to do? Publicly state that the United States already has a 
Strategic Partnership with Afghanistan until 2024 that was negotiated 
by the Obama administration and we promise to be there for the long 
term in an advise-and-assist capacity along the usual lines of 
providing intelligence, Special Forces trainers, close air support and 
the like. Afghans don't care if we have 8,400 troops, or 12,000 troops 
or 20,000 troops. Clearly there is a difference from a purely military 
point of view but from a political point of view the message Afghans 
want to hear is that we are not abandoning them and plan to stay the 
course. Such a public announcement of a long-term commitment to 
Afghanistan will help NATO and other allies also commit for the long 
term; it will also undermine the Taliban and change the calculus of the 
hedging strategies of neighbors such as Pakistan.
14. Free American hostages in the Afghan/Pakistan border regions</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">There are five Americans being held by the Taliban-affiliated 
Haqqanis. The Trump administration could put a win on the board by 
securing their release. The Haqqanis want Anas Haqqani--one of their 
family members--to be released in a prisoner exchange for the American 
hostages. Anas is a relatively bit player in the Haqqani Network who is 
now on death row in Afghanistan for raising money for terrorism. This 
prisoner exchange would be somewhat politically costly for the 
government of Ashraf Ghani, but it would secure five American lives, 
some of whom have been in captivity for 5 years. The United States can 
help broker this deal.
15. Develop ``micro targeting'' counter messages for those who are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">looking at ISIS propaganda</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Advertisers on the internet routinely do this for consumers looking 
at, say, shoes and there is really no technical reason that this could 
not be done effectively for those who are looking at ISIS propaganda. 
Indeed, companies such as Google are already doing this and the United 
States State Department is also quietly supporting similar efforts 
around the Muslim world using local voices in local languages that 
counter the message of ISIS.
16. Increase funding and research for ``photo DNA'' technologies of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">kind that have largely banished child pornography images from</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">social media platforms.
17. Some in the Trump administration want to designate the Muslim</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. This is a bad idea</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">that will surely backfire, as it would effectively criminalize</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">and label as terrorists the tens of millions of Muslims around</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">the world who are part of the Muslim Brotherhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">While it is certainly the case that a small number of Muslim 
Brothers have radicalized and engaged in terrorism, that does not make 
the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. There are tens of millions of 
Christian fundamentalists in the United States, a tiny number of whom 
have conducted violence against abortion clines and doctors, yet that 
would not be an argument for criminalizing Christian fundamentalists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Bergen ">    Also members of the Muslim Brotherhood play significant roles in 
the governments and/or parliaments of Iraq, Jordan, Tunisia, and 
Turkey. Designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization 
would label as criminals political leaders of four countries in the 
Middle East, some of which are close American allies and all of which 
happen to be relatively open societies compared to the Gulf State 
autocracies. In Egypt the Sisi government has criminalized the Muslim 
Brotherhood, an extraordinary decision since it effectively has 
criminalized the largest opposition organization in the country as well 
as the previous Morsi government. The United States should not be 
aligning itself with the policies of the Egyptian dictatorship.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. King">Thank you, Mr. Bergen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. King">Commissioner Davis, if I could start, I discussed this with 
Director Comey. We had the cases in Orlando, the case in 
California where the FBI had been carrying out investigations 
and then they closed the investigation when nothing was found. 
I am not being critical of the FBI for not finding it. Just by 
the nature of the people who they are investigating, you may 
not find it in 4 months or 6 months, whatever the time limit 
happens to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. King">    Do you have any suggestions as to how, you know, the FBI 
can continue the investigation or somehow ensure that the local 
police are fully briefed and they carry out, you know, continue 
at least some surveillance and some investigation and then 
report back to the FBI or work with the FBI?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Davis">Thank you, Chairman. Two points on that issue.
The first would be to follow the lead of what the Boston police 
department is doing right now, which is a multi-time, each year 
there are multiple scrubs of all of the information in the 
Guardian database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Davis">Whenever there is an event coming up, in preparation for 
that event there is a team sent in to work with the JTTF to go 
through the database to see who is out there and who might pose 
a threat. Then there is a joint meeting on what we could do to 
stop that from happening. That is a best practice that should 
happen Nation-wide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Davis">The other thing is, and this is more an organizational 
issue, I have worked in big police departments, I have run big 
organizations; since I have stepped down, I have worked with 
some of the biggest corporations in the United States, 50,000 
employees, 100,000 employees all across the globe. Those 
companies can't get things done unless they are continually 
reviewing their policies to make sure their policies are being 
carried out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Davis">So as I said in my testimony, a review of those agreements 
and a real check to make sure that the organization hasn't 
snapped back to old practices. When you have an organization 
and you are going to change that organization, that rubber band 
can stretch so far, but then it snaps back sometimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Davis">    It is usually in the middle of the organization, the mid-
level managers that are responsible for that. The well-
intentioned leaders of the organization want to see the right 
thing happen. If you are not continually reviewing that 
process, you can have that snap-back effect, and I think that 
is what we have to guard against here in the United States.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. King">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. King">Also, Ed, you mentioned about working with the local Muslim 
communities. I know of several instances, for instance, in 
Suffolk County in New York where the police have very close 
relationships, including monthly meetings at the mosque with 
the imam. Yet in several of those mosques, you had members of 
the mosque who were arrested overseas or arrested here in the 
United States for being involved in terrorist plots. In several 
of those I am aware of, the police said, well, why didn't you 
tell us then?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. King">In fact, Venus is one. He was arrested in Afghanistan and 
he was planning attack on the Long Island Railroad. The imam 
probably said, well, he came to our mosque and we told him we 
don't to do jihad here. But you never told the police when they 
were coming into warn them about Venus. There were two others, 
also from the South Shore, with similar-type instances. What 
has your experience been as far as getting cooperation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. King">    Also, you mentioned the Somalis. I know this goes back 
several years, but we had testimony before our committee that 
when a young man was killed in Somalia, a man from Minneapolis 
was killed in Somalia, basically the local leaders told the 
people not to cooperate with the FBI. Now, that was going back 
several years. Do you know if those situations have improved?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Davis">Well, there is no question, Chairman, that there
are going to be problems. This is not a perfect solution to the 
issue, it is just one of many things that has to continue to 
play out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Davis">In the example I used where we had the Bridges Group, the 
main deficiency with the Bridges Group was only bringing people 
in that were very friendly to us. So we had the same people 
coming in from 9/11 up until 2013 and we got to know them very 
well and they were friends. We never expanded beyond that group 
into the more radical mosques, doing outreach to places where 
we knew were problematic. That is really, I think, the key to 
this is to establish trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Mr. Davis">    But even if you do establish trust, there are still going 
to be very sophisticated actors in these groups that don't 
divulge their plans. That is when you have to pay attention to 
the surveillance part of it to work these cases as if they are 
sophisticated and, you know, bad-intentioned criminals and 
actors from foreign places that are attempting to hurt us. So a 
combination of surveillance and outreach, I think, is the 
answer to it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Mr. King"> Also, I think it was mentioned that we have only
had, in fact I mentioned it in my opening statement, there has 
not been a large-scale attack, but there has been good police 
and good FBI work that stopped them. For instance, the 2009 
attempted subway attack in New York. If that had succeeded, at 
least hundreds, maybe thousands of people could have been 
killed. That was one, so in many ways these numbers aren't 
always apples and oranges or they are apples and oranges 
because there could be many more thousands killed it had not 
been for the extensive surveillance that was being carried out.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Mr. Davis">There is no question. The success has been
across the board. Local, State, and Federal agencies have 
stopped these events from happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Mr. Davis">One of the problems that my contacts in the world of 
antiterrorism work mentioned is the large number of people with 
psychological problems that are bubbling up and end up being 
reported to JTTFs and the lack of sort of a way to deal with 
somebody who has just got a psych problem and mentions 
terrorism as opposed to someone who actually is intent on 
hurting the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Mr. Davis">    Mr. Joscelyn mentioned it in his testimony, some sort of 
middle-of-the-line way to deal with people who are presenting 
with serious psych problems and could do something bad, but 
most likely need some type of supervision or treatment, that is 
a huge problem for JTTFs across the country.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Mr. King">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Mr. King">We will go now to the Ranking Member for questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Mr. King">    Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Bergen">I would like to go to you because I think that
some of the things that you were touching on feed or are 
addressing the issue that we are facing in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Mr. Bergen">I am sure it happens in every change of administration. I 
am not specifically saying that this has anything to do with 
the fact that it is Donald Trump as our President now. But 
rhetoric and what you say matters. Trying to make a transition 
from a very heated campaign season to actually governing in the 
space of National security. I would just like to ask you if you 
could talk more about the Muslim Brotherhood and how you think 
this administration should deal with that group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Mr. Bergen">I would like you talk more about the no-fly, no-buy. I give 
Chairman King a lot of credit for being a patriot before being 
a politician and introducing that bill in the last Congress. 
Hopefully it will be reintroduced without any political 
fanfare, just recognizing the great value of it, and I commend 
him for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    But if you could just talk more about how, you know, the 
terminology of radical Islamic terrorism, what is that doing to 
help, hurt the relationships we have to have with all the other 
Muslim countries that have been our partner in this fight 
against terrorism? What can we do to help that situation as 
Members of Congress?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Thank you. You know, I think the discussion of
terminology can be less important than sometimes it is seen in 
this town. So, I mean, that is just my personal view. You know, 
we don't want to confuse, I mean, you know, if the reporting 
about H.R. McMaster is true, he told the NSC on Thursday, you 
know, that he was not in favor of using this term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Clearly, you know, whether it is in Iraq or Afghanistan, 
our key allies are Muslims. So we don't want to confuse them 
with the idea that somehow we were at war with Islam. That is 
just a fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Bergen">But our actions are much more important than what we say. 
You know, we have inflicted a huge amount of damage on ISIS 
already, I think the latest figure about 60,000 ISIS fighters 
have been killed. So whether we call radical Islamic terrorism 
or, you know, violent extremists, whatever we call them, 
actually ISIS is in, you know, grave danger right now of losing 
its most important city, Mosul. So actions are the key.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Bergen">So going to your questions, Representative Rice, I mean, 
the no-fly, no-buy, think about Major Nidal Hasan, he is an 
Army major. He is not a common criminal. He had to buy four 
semiautomatic weapons to kill 13 people at Fort Hood. He 
couldn't go on the street and, you know, very unlikely to buy 
one, you know, from a criminal. He didn't know any criminals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Bergen">So, of course, it is not a perfect solution that if you are 
on the no-fly list you can't buy a semiautomatic weapon, but it 
is better than many of the other things that have been 
proposed. It would actually make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Similarly with the Muslim Brotherhood, I mean, the largest 
Arab country is Egypt with 80 million people, until very 
recently their government was the Muslim Brotherhood. They were 
democratically elected, unlike so many of the other regimes 
around the region. So this idea of designating them as a 
terrorist organization is simply ridiculous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Miss Rice. Commissioner Davis, just to talk more, because I 
actually think that what you did after the bombing in terms of 
reaching out to the community is incredibly valuable as opposed 
to bringing people in instead of shunning them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Can you just talk more about how much of your time is 
spent? You know, because I know that there is some resistance 
on the part of law enforcement, people want to be more 
aggressive in certain communities and shut them out and focus 
on them in a different way than a community policing model 
would allow for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    So if you could just talk more about the value of bringing 
people in, you know, and going into these communities and 
trying to get information from them and let them know that we 
are trying to work together. Whatever or however your 
philosophy, whatever that was.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Davis">Right. Thank you, Ranking Member. I policed
urban areas and there are enclaves of people who live in urban 
areas, depending on where were you go in the city and many 
times these individuals need our help more than anybody else. 
So it is important for us as a police organization to establish 
trust across the city so that when someone is in trouble and 
they need assistance they are not afraid to call us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Davis">We spent a lot of time doing that when I was the 
commissioner in Boston. It continues today and it has been 
going on for 30 years. That outreach is critical and that 
trusting relationship is critical for us to be able to work in 
these communities and protect the good people who are there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Davis">If we don't do that, then the people who live in these 
communities will not trust the police, they will not call us, 
and the bad guys will be able to run roughshod over their own 
fellow either citizens or whatever region they are from, in 
these small neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Davis">It is crucial that we, that we maintain close 
relationships. That is, as Mr. Bergen said, it is much more 
likely for a peer to report this bad activity than it is for 
someone just, you know, at the mosque. It is going to be 
someone who they know and they work with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Davis">This is true. I have worked narcotics cases for much of my 
career. If we weren't talking to people from the countries, the 
source countries, of narcotics, we would never be able to put a 
case together against the criminals who are actually 
transporting the narcotics into the country. The same applies 
to terrorism.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. King">Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20530.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. King">Dear Attorney General Sessions: We respectfully request that the 
Department of Justice reopens the investigation into the unindicted co-
conspirators listed in the largest terror financing trial in our 
Nation's history, United States v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and 
Development et al.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. King">In December 2001, The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and 
Development (HLF), the largest Islamic charity in the America, was 
designated as a Specially Designated Terrorist (SDT) organization by 
the U.S. Government. After freezing its assets, the FBI concluded that 
HLF's primary goal was the subsidization of HAMAS, and a criminal case 
ensued in July 2004. In 2008, HLF and several of its senior leaders 
were convicted of funneling more than $12 million to HAMAS, with the 
jury finding defendants guilty on all counts of the indictment. 
Evidence presented by the prosecutors included a list of 246 unindicted 
co-conspirators (attached) and its designation was broken into 
categories based on the extent of their participation and/or 
association with the HLF, HAMAS, and the Muslim Brotherhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. King">While HLF was brought to justice, the Obama Administration refused 
to investigate these unindicted co-conspirators, and in the decade 
since the trial, the threat of radical Islamist terrorism has developed 
substantially. If the individuals and groups on this list are funneling 
money through the U.S. to fight our enemies, the American people have 
the right to know. While appalling that President Obama refused even to 
acknowledge the threat of radical Islamist terrorism, the mistakes of 
the past must be corrected and those who finance terror be prosecuted 
to the fullest extent of the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. King">We truly hope that under your authority, the Department of Justice 
will reopen the investigation into these unindicted co-conspirators. We 
look forward to your reply, and wish you the best in your new position.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Mr. Perry">So I think my first question would go to Mr.
Joscelyn. Wahhabi ideology is essentially the wellspring of the 
doctrine and world views of radical Islamic terrorist 
organizations or Islamism or fundamentalism or whatever you 
folks feel comfortable with calling it, in general, and of ISIS 
in particular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Mr. Perry">I know you are often focused on al-Qaeda, but I know that 
you are well-versed in ISIS as well and the general theme. Many 
of ISIS' official publications are classic works of the Wahhabi 
canon and ISIS ideologues and supporters who regularly liken 
the so-called caliphate to the first Saudi Wahhabi state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Mr. Perry">Since 1979, Saudi Arabia has engaged in a persistent and 
consistent campaign of exporting Wahhabi ideology throughout 
the Muslim world, spending about $4 billion annually on 
mosques, madrasas, preachers, students, and textbooks. Wahhabi 
ideology has become so prominent in the Muslim world that by 
2013, 75 percent of North American Islamic centers relied on 
Wahhabi preachers who promote anti-Western ideas in person and 
on-line through their sermons and through the Saudi-produced 
literature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="676" speaker="Mr. Perry">    So the question is, what role does the export of Wahhabism 
by Saudi Arabia play in the radicalization of Muslims, whether 
it be in regard to ISIS, al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, or otherwise, 
both at home and abroad and in grooming them for recruitment by 
terrorist organizations?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Well, Wahhabi extremism is an issue in a lot
of ways. I mean, in areas where the funding goes to fund those 
mosques or madrasas, it oftentimes runs roughshod over local 
Islamic traditions, basically replaced by this extremist 
version of Islam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">But in terms of ISIS and al-Qaeda, we also have to be 
careful a little bit where ISIS, in particular, basically draws 
on ideas outside of the Wahhabi realm quite often and has 
actually turned its rhetorical guns and is trying to turn its 
literal guns on the Saudi Kingdom on a regular basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Same thing with al-Qaeda. I mean, you know, part of why the 
Saudis have intervened in Yemen, for example, is they were 
worried both about the Houthi rebellion there and also on the 
al-Qaeda side. So there is a story to be told on Saudi funding 
of extremism for sure. I think it is a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">It is not the version of Islam I think most Muslims around 
the world are used to or know, it is not part of the regular 
customs. I have seen complaints everywhere from Nigeria through 
North Africa through East Africa all the way into South Asia of 
where when the Saudi's turn on the spigot basically a very 
different version of sort-of Islam shows up. I think we should 
be careful about tracking that and understanding that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="681" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">To your point about the terrorism finance, Congressman, I 
would second the idea that any specific violations of terrorist 
finance laws need to be investigated and prosecuted here in the 
United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="682" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">    I am aware, I think I am aware, that there has been a slow 
roll on that issue. The way I think about the world is in terms 
of very specific threats and very specific ties to terrorists, 
and if there are organizations here in the United States, which 
are engaging in that sort of fundraising activity once again, 
they should be investigated and prosecuted.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="683" speaker="Mr. Perry">So just kind-of following up on your discussion
about most Muslims, and I would agree with you that most 
Muslims eschew or reject the Wahhabi or the strict structural 
fundamental form of Wahhabiism that is put upon them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="684" speaker="Mr. Perry">    But I still am concerned about oftentimes the high 
percentage of Muslims world-wide and these peaceful Muslims, 
let us just be clear here, they are the ones that are put upon 
by the this ideology and most of the reign of terror, if you 
will, by the Wahhabists or Islamist.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="685" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn"> Correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Mr. Perry">But many of the world's Muslim population,
including the United States, sees sharia, which is oftentimes 
as well associated with Wahhabiism, as perfectly OK and 
appropriate to live under.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Mr. Perry">    So in a circumstance where many of the occupants might not 
like the kind of the outcome of living under those 
circumstances, they don't really disagree with it fundamentally 
when questioned. What do you make of that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Well, as a secular humanist, I am certainly
no fan of sharia law, but I will say this. Sharia means 
different things within the Muslim community. There isn't one 
interpretation or meaning of that. That is not a cop-out or an 
apology for it, it is just really sharia can mean a number of 
different things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="689" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">What I think you are concerned about or I would be 
concerned about are organizations that basically say that 
sharia law should supplant sort-of American customs or American 
ideas and principles. I think that is something that needs to 
be contested in the court of public opinion and exposed and 
sort-of debated is basically the way I would handle that more 
often than not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="690" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">I don't think, you know, just because an individual Muslim 
necessarily adheres to sharia, it may not mean the version of 
sharia that is sort-of totalitarian or sort-of wants to 
supplant American customs. It may mean something much more 
local and personal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">    I certainly know, you know, Muslims in the New York, New 
Jersey area who will tell you that they are sharia compliant, 
and yet they don't believe in Muslim Brotherhood ideology or, 
you know, al-Qaeda's ideology or ISIS or anything like that. So 
what I would look at is basically organizations that sort-of 
advocate a version of that that is sort-of totalitarian in 
nature and contest it in the court of public opinion.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Mr. Perry"> Thank you, Mr. Chair, I yield.

    <paragraph paraId="693" speaker="Mr. King"> Mr. Keating.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="694" speaker="Mr. Keating">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Just quickly, you can just say yes if you agree with this. 
But is the No. 1 threat to the citizens of this country still 
home-grown violent extremist people here? Is that, would you 
say, the major threat that we have?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="696" speaker="Mr. Davis"> I believe it is right now.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="697" speaker="Mr. Keating"> Mr. Joscelyn.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="698" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn"> I think it is a major threat with one caveat,
which you will see in my testimony, which is if eventually they 
are successful in infiltrating a team onto U.S. soil, but it is 
the predominant threat on a day-to-day basis.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Mr. Keating"> Mr. Simcox.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simcox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="700" speaker="Mr. Simcox"> Yes, I think the most numerous amount of home-
grown, although what we have seen in Europe is that the highest 
body count often come from when external planners are involved.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="701" speaker="Mr. Keating"> Mr. Bergen.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Mr. Keating">OK.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Mr. Keating">I was really pleased, Commissioner Davis, to hear your 
views on the progress that we have made, and thanks for your 
work with this committee, on dealing in the aftermath of the 
Boston Marathon bombing, the lessons learned, and the fact that 
we are sharing information and the legislation that requires 
the codification of that so it doesn't get lost as people come 
and go through different agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Mr. Keating">I just wanted to touch base on one aspect that all of you 
might feel, particularly Commissioner Davis since he has been 
there. I think the area where there is a great deal of stress 
on our officials trying to counter terrorism in this country is 
at that guardian and at the assessment stage, because I think 
the volume is so high on the FBI as they go through that. Their 
resources are strained, it is very difficult, and there is a 
time line they have to work with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="706" speaker="Mr. Keating">Afterwards, you know, there is what we used to call, you 
know, the closing the book on everything, so that information 
is not shared. I believe that the same progress we have made 
sharing information could be greater utilized at that 
assessment stage working with people. I looked at the New 
Jersey and New York bombings and, you know, from what was 
public in that information, I thought at that stage greater 
participation at the local level could have been better, and I 
think that is a case elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="707" speaker="Mr. Keating">    How can we accomplish that to a better degree?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="708" speaker="Mr. Davis">Well, I think that the rules and regulations
that the FBI operate under are extremely difficult to follow. I 
have looked at them and I know in my sort-of experience of 
investing cases, they are overly bureaucratic and I think maybe 
review of that would be in order. So I think that is sort-of 
the first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="709" speaker="Mr. Davis">    But I will agree with you that group think on these 
situations results in a much better outcome and also eliminates 
the potential for criticism and review afterwards.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="710" speaker="Mr. Keating">I think it helps deal with the problem you
referenced that I think is a very major problem. People with 
psychological difficulties, trying to screen out where there is 
a real problem. I think people at the local level have more 
insight into that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="711" speaker="Mr. Keating">    So beyond the rules and regulations, is it a force 
multiplier? You know, I know you don't want to comment on if we 
need more resources for the FBI. I happen to think they could 
use more in that regard, but that is a critical area that I 
think we could improve things.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="712" speaker="Mr. Davis"> I think so, too. I think the coming together on
these cases, deciding how to vet the real threats from these 
psychological----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="713" speaker="Mr. Keating">Yes, taking it beyond information sharing into
more joint reviews of that. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="714" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Quick question, Mr. Bergen. You mentioned the Executive 
Order didn't help things, basically it didn't achieve anything. 
You didn't get into the fact, can it hinder our efforts? I 
didn't think you did.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="715" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> You know, I just don't know.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="716" speaker="Mr. Keating">Yes. Anyone have any thoughts on that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="717" speaker="Mr. Keating">    There were reports that the CVE funding that was there were 
turned down by certain groups after the Executive Order. That 
is what made me think, is that a problem there?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="718" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> Actually, let me revise. You know, the Iraqi
government is really angry about this ban and clearly, you 
know, who is dying in Mosul, it is overwhelmingly Iraqis. So, 
you know, we managed to really anger one of our key allies with 
this ban.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="719" speaker="Mr. Keating"> OK. Any other questions about how we can
improve some of the activities through the CVE? How is that 
working? Are there more funds necessary? Are they effective? I 
know in Boston and New York they have used those funds a great 
deal.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="720" speaker="Mr. Davis"> Right, we have. As I said in my comments
earlier, outreach is extremely important; identifying what is 
happening. But also, you know, saying what this really is and 
identifying precisely what the threat is, who is responsible 
for it, and making sure that we have a clear idea, as Robin 
said in his testimony, is as important as the outreach. This 
has to be a balanced approach.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="721" speaker="Mr. Keating">OK. I will have more follow-up questions in
writing, since my time is expired, on airport issues and 
airline issues, which I think that we have made great progress, 
but still remain as threats. So I will save that for my written 
portion since my time is out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="722" speaker="Mr. Keating">    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.

    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>

great leadership, your very fine congressperson was such a 
champion for Boston, but you were certainly the gleaming 
example of what we hoped, tragically, would come out of 
homeland security when there was a tragedy. We hoped you 
wouldn't have to encounter, but the collaboration, the local 
leadership, the insisting on the sharing of intelligence, you 
did it all and we are grateful for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="728" speaker="Mr. King">I think that is the way that we put forward the best

    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="">OLATHE, Kan.--``The Jameson guys,'' as some on the staff at Austins 
Bar and Grill knew the pair, were on the patio on Wednesday evening. It 
was hardly unusual: Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, two 
immigrants from India, often enjoyed an after-work whiskey at the bar 
they had adopted as a hangout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="">Adam W. Purinton was also there, tossing ethnic slurs at the two 
men and suggesting they did not belong in the United States, other 
customers said. Patrons complained, and Mr. Purinton was thrown out.</paragraph>

men, the authorities said. Mr. Kuchibhotla was killed, and Mr. Madasani 
was wounded, along with a 24-year-old man who had tried to apprehend 
the gunman, who fled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="">Mr. Purinton, 51, was extradited to Kansas from Missouri on Friday, 
and he is charged with premeditated first-degree murder and two counts 
of attempted premeditated first-degree murder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="">The attack, which the Federal and local authorities are 
investigating as a possible hate crime, reverberated far beyond both 
states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="">It raised new alarms about a climate of hostility toward foreigners 
in the United States, where President Trump has made clamping down on 
immigration a central plank of his ``America first'' agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="">The White House strongly rejected the notion that there might be 
any connection between the shooting and the new administration's sharp 
language about immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="">``People are devastated,'' said Somil Chandwani, a friend of the 
two victims who lives in Overland Park, Kan. ``I wouldn't say they are 
angry. They have a sense of insecurity at the moment. People are trying 
to find answers.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="">A charging document released on Friday gave no details about the 
motive for the shooting. Law enforcement officials in Kansas, citing 
the continuing investigation and judicial ethics standards, said little 
about the episode.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="">Still, the F.B.I.'s role in the inquiry suggested that officials 
had found some evidence that could eventually lead to civil rights 
charges in connection with the shooting, which occurred around 7:15 
p.m. Wednesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="">``He snapped, and this is not his typical self,'' the suspect's 
mother, Marsha Purinton, said before declining further comment.

Rapids, Iowa, in an undated photo. Mr. Kuchibhotla was shot dead 
outside a bar in Kansas on Wednesday. Credit Courtesy of Kranti Shalia, 
via Associated Press</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="">In a brief phone interview on Friday night, Mr. Madasani described 
the remarks made Wednesday by the man sitting near him and Mr. 
Kuchibhotla at the restaurant. ``He asked us what visa are we currently 
on and whether we are staying here illegally,'' Mr. Madasani said. 
(Both men were educated in the United States and were working here 
legally.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="">``We didn't react,'' Mr. Madasani said. ``People do stupid things 
all the time. This guy took it to the next level.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="">Mr. Madasani said he went in to get a manager, and by the time he 
returned to the patio, the man was being escorted out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="">After Mr. Purinton was thrown out, Jeremy Luby, 41, a software 
developer, said he offered to pick up the tab for the two men, who 
thanked him during a brief conversation about work and cultural 
differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="">``It was wrong what happened to them,'' Mr. Luby said. ``I thought 
it was a nice gesture to say, `I'm sorry someone was being rude to you 
like that.' ''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="">After the shooting began, another patron, Ian Grillot, 24, said he 
tried to count the shots while he hid under a table. Thinking the 
gunman had run out of ammunition, Mr. Grillot said, he confronted him, 
only to be shot in the hand and the chest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="">``It wasn't right, and I didn't want the gentleman to potentially 
go after somebody else,'' Mr. Grillot said in a video released by the 
hospital where he received treatment. ``He did it once. What would stop 
him from doing it again?''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="">The shots echoed around the area, and Chris Lacross soon emerged 
from a store a few doors down to an unimaginable scene: an emergency 
medical technician performing CPR on a man lying in the doorway of the 
bar's front patio, where tables and chairs had been flipped over, and 
someone was shouting that they needed towels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="">Another man took off his shirt and applied pressure to the wound of 
another victim, who was writhing in pain, said Mr. Lacross, who allowed 
some people to use a store restroom to wash away spattered blood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="">Within minutes, an emergency dispatcher, in a transmission archived 
by the Broadcastify website, told officers, ``We're being advised the 
suspect's name is Adam, and he's a white male wearing a white shirt 
with military medals.''

first-degree murder and two counts of attempted premeditated first-
degree murder. Credit Henry County Sheriff's Office, via Associated 
Press</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="">Capt. Sonny Lynch, the deputy chief of police in Clinton, Mo., 
where Mr. Purinton was arrested at an Applebee's restaurant, said a 
bartender there called the police after a customer confessed to his 
involvement in a shooting hours earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="">``He was talking to her--`I'm on the run; I'm hiding out from the 
law'--so she stuck around,'' Captain Lynch said of the bartender. ``She 
just hung out there talking to the guy until he said, `I shot those 
guys, and that's why I'm hiding out from the police.' ''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="">Mr. Purinton was arrested without incident, Captain Lynch said, and 
invoked his constitutional rights. It was not clear whether he had a 
lawyer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="">Mr. Purinton spent time in the Navy and, according to a website 
where veterans can list their military records, was deployed aboard the 
Long Beach, a missile cruiser, from 1988 to 1990. He later worked for 
the Federal Aviation Administration but left the agency in 2000, a 
spokeswoman said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="">In Johnson County, Kan., at least, he has had few run-ins with law 
enforcement. Court records showed a limited history: a speeding ticket 
in 2008, as well as a 1999 drunken-driving charge that was dismissed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="">A neighbor, Lisa Puckett, said that Mr. Purinton was frequently 
intoxicated but that news of a shooting was stunning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="">``We always wondered if he might hurt himself, but we didn't think 
he would hurt someone else,'' she said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="">The dead man, Mr. Kuchibhotla, worked for Garmin, a GPS navigation 
and communications device company. One of the wounded men, Mr. 
Madasani, like Mr. Kuchibhotla in his early 30's, also worked for 
Garmin, according to the Indian government. On Friday, counselors were 
at the company's campus in Olathe, a hub of South Asian immigrants 
where 84 languages are spoken in the local school district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="">Speaking to reporters on Friday at the Garmin headquarters, Mr. 
Kuchibhotla's widow, Sunayana Dumala, said she had long been worried by 
shootings she read about in the newspaper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="">``I, especially, I was always concerned, are we doing the right 
thing of staying in the United States of America?'' she said. ``But he 
always assured me that only good things happen to good people.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="">Now, Ms. Dumala said, she needed ``an answer from the government'' 
about what ``they're going to do to stop this hate crime.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="">Mr. Madasani's father, Jagan Mohan Reddy, a government engineer in 
Hyderabad, India, said his family was in shock. He said he did not know 
whether he would ask Mr. Madasani, who received a graduate degree from 
the University of Missouri-Kansas City, and another son living in the 
United States to leave the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="">``We have to think it over,'' he said. ``My sons are not new to 
America. They have been staying there for the last 10 to 12 years. This 
is a new situation, and they are the best judges.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="">Mr. Madasani, who has been released from the hospital, said he was 
recovering physically and mentally. ``I'm definitely doing much better, 
but it's not over yet,'' he said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="">On Friday, Mr. Kuchibhotla's killing and the wounding of Mr. 
Madasani led to a chorus of fury in India, where the attack dominated 
the news media to such an extent that the top American diplomat in the 
country was compelled to issue a statement condemning what she 
described as a ``tragic and senseless act.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="">In Washington, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, 
rejected any link between Mr. Trump's policy agenda and the shooting, 
which many Indians believed might have been inspired by the president's 
harsh tone on immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="">The Justice Department is under pressure to bring Federal charges 
in the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="">Moussa Elbayoumy, the board chairman for the Kansas chapter of the 
Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the government should 
``consider filing hate crime charges in order to send a strong message 
that violence targeting religious or ethnic minorities will not be 
tolerated.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="">On Friday night, a diverse crowd of more than 400 gathered to 
grieve at First Baptist Church down the street from the bar. They 
offered their prayers to the Kuchibhotlas and the Madasanis, 
characterized the shooting as an anomaly in an otherwise peaceful, 
tolerant suburb and vowed they would not let that change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="">``As a community, we are still shocked, devastated, and angry,'' 
Mayor Michael Copeland said. ``But this is not how this ends. This is 
not our Olathe.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="">He added, ``One evil act does not divide a united community.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="">Mr. Purinton was scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Austins, 
meanwhile, planned to reopen on Saturday</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="">    Ms. Jackson Lee. Second is, ``1,094 bias-related incidents

related-incidents-month-following-election
Hatewatch Staff</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. King">This is the fourth update in the Southern Poverty Law Center's 
effort to collect reports of bias-related harassment and intimidation 
around the country following the election. This update spans the period 
from November 9 to December 12.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. King">The SPLC collected reports from news articles, social media, and 
direct submissions via our #ReportHate intake page. The SPLC made every 
effort to verify each report, but many included in the count remain 
anecdotal. Here's the breakdown nation-wide:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. King">While the total number has surpassed the 1,000 mark, reports have 
slowed down significantly compared to the days immediately following 
the election. The reports are nonetheless as heartbreaking and 
infuriating as before. In Massachusetts:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. King">Just now, our 14-year-old son walked into our house and informed me 
that he just experienced his first hate crime. It's dark out so he was 
riding his bike on the sidewalk down the street from our house. He sees 
a man walking in the middle of the sidewalk, so our son says, ``Excuse 
me''. The man steps to the side and then yells, ``Hey nigger, next time 
get off of the bike''. This is a quick walk from our new home and I am 
enraged and saddened that someone near us would do that.
In Florida:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. King">I witnessed an apparently inebriated older white man in the park 
make an obscene gesture at two women in hijabs in a public park. The 
women scurried away and the man turned to me perhaps under the 
assumption that I shared his enmity. He made remarks about Ohio and, to 
the effect, that Muslims are subhuman and that ``President Trump got 
his work cut out for him.'' We exchanged words but I avoided an 
altercation and left the scene.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. King">Overall, anti-immigrant incidents (315) remain the most reported, 
followed by anti-black (221), anti-Muslim (112), and anti-LGBT (109). 
Anti-Trump incidents numbered 26 (6 of which were also anti-white in 
nature, with 2 non-Trump-related anti-white incidents reported).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. King">We've also been tracking false reports (13 total), as a handful of 
high-profile incidents have been recently uncovered, including two (I, 
II) that we had previously counted and have removed for this update.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. King">While it is almost certain that more false reports will be 
uncovered, and the SPLC will be quick to update our database, the 
right-wing narrative that this wave of incidents are all hoaxes simply 
doesn't stand up to the numbers. Counting all 13 false reports (listed 
at the bottom of this post), of which only two were counted in our 
previous reporting, amounts to just over 1 percent of the total number 
of incidents collected in this update.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. King">Let's get to the numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. King">As we've previously reported, many incidents cross multiple 
``types.'' This voicemail, left at a church known for its immigrant 
community outreach in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Nov. 21, we 
categorized as one incident. Its main type was anti-immigrant while its 
subtypes were anti-LGBT, anti-Latino, and Trump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. King">Here's the transcription:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. King">``I think this is the gay church, that help gays that get kicked 
out of the country along with all the fricken Mexicans that are illegal 
that you guys are hiding illegally. I hope Trump gets ya. Trump Trump 
Trump. Trump Trump Trump. Trump's gonna get your asses out of here and 
throw you over the wall. You dirty rotten scumbags. Hillary is a 
scumbag bitch. Too bad waaa waaa. Hillary lost. Hillary lost. Trump's 
gonna getcha and throw you over the wall.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. King">Like the incident above, around 37 percent of all incidents 
directly referenced either President-elect Donald Trump, his campaign 
slogans, or his infamous remarks about sexual assault.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. King">Within these Trump-related incidents, we can see which incident 
types most frequently included a reference to Trump (excluding anti-and 
pro-Trump only incidents which would both be 100 percent).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. King">By far, anti-woman incidents saw the greatest share:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. King">Trump-related incidents (including anti-Trump (26) incidents) 
appear to follow the same trend over time, dropping off since their 
peak during the period immediately following Election Day:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. King">The most frequently reported incident type, anti-immigrant (315) 
incidents, were around 29 percent of all of those reported to us. We 
saw a number of different targets, as well as a more generalized 
sentiment against perceived foreigners that was vague in terms of 
targeting race or country of origin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. King">Those subtypes break down as follows, with anti-Muslim incidents 
included (anti-Muslim incidents, separate from our anti-immigrant count 
but related in quality, also encapsulate incidents that could also be 
defined as anti-Arab):</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. King">Of particular note in this updated time period is a string of 
hateful anti-Muslim letters sent to mosques and Islamic centers around 
the country. Between Nov. 23 and Dec. 2, the following centers all 
received an identical letter that described Muslims as ``Children of 
Satan'' and a ``vile and filthy people.''
California:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Center of Claremont
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Center of Northridge
  &lt;bullet&gt; Evergreen Islamic Center
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Center of Southern California, Los Angeles</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. King">(Koreatown)
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Center of Davis
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Cultural Center of Fresno
  &lt;bullet&gt; Long Beach Islamic Center
Elsewhere:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Masjid Miami Gardens
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Center of Savannah
  &lt;bullet&gt; Masjid Al-Fajr Islamic Center of Greater Indianapolis
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Center of Boston
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Center of Ann Arbor
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Center of East Lansing
  &lt;bullet&gt; Islamic Center of Cleveland
  &lt;bullet&gt; reports of an Islamic center in Denver, Colo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. King">We've also been tracking the reported distribution of white 
nationalist (47), KKK (7), and anti-Semitic (3) posters and fliers. In 
total, we captured 57 separate incidents with a spike coming on the 
first Monday following the election:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. King">With white nationalist ``alt-right'' figureheads like Richard 
Spencer and Milo Yiannopolous touring college campuses, the increased 
confidence that these groups are feeling following Trump's victory, and 
the unprecedented press attention they are receiving, it isn't 
surprising to see that nearly 74 percent of these incidents occurred on 
campuses, where the `movement' hopes to build its numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. King">The white nationalist alt-right youth groups behind these incidents 
were American Vanguard, Identity Evropa, TheRightStuff. We collected 
reports from the following colleges and universities:
  &lt;bullet&gt; University of Arkansas, Fort Smith
  &lt;bullet&gt; Arizona State University
  &lt;bullet&gt; University California, San Diego
  &lt;bullet&gt; University California, Davis
  &lt;bullet&gt; UCLA

  &lt;bullet&gt; Amherst College
  &lt;bullet&gt; University of Maryland
  &lt;bullet&gt; Lebanon Valley College
  &lt;bullet&gt; Emerson College</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. King">The breakdown of location types has stayed steady throughout our 
reporting, with the majority of incidents occurring at K-12 schools 
(226), businesses like Starbucks, Walmart, and restaurants (203), and 
colleges and universities (172).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. King">In the days to come, if you or someone you know has experienced or 
witnessed a hate incident, please consider submitting the incident to 
the SPLC after first reporting to the proper authorities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. King">missing curfew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. King">Ms. Jackson Lee. I also would like to pose a question, Mr. 
Chairman, I will put it in writing, but I would ask that this 
committee, being the front-line committee on intelligence, be 
part of the investigation that would determine what questions 
were posed to the Department of Homeland Security and DOJ, but 
our jurisdiction is homeland security, in asking, let me just 
say I don't know whether the word was ``demanding,'' a 
memorandum that would support the administration's decision on 
the banning of Muslim countries, seven Muslim countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. King">It is a reported in the media that the Department of 
Homeland Security was asked to produce the memo to support the 
actions that were already taken. I think that is important 
information for us to have as Members of the Homeland Security 
Committee and as well for us to do our unfettered work, 
unfettered investigatory work and also meeting with the 
standards of this hearing, the future of counterterrorism, 
addressing the evolving threat in domestic security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. King">We have to ensure that independence in our agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. King">Let me pursue this with Mr. Bergen. Thank you for your 
work. I wouldn't say that I am, I won't use the term 
``fascinated,'' I was about to say it, but I am in awe at the 
initial writing of the Executive Order and all of its nuances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. King">One of the ones that really struck me was the 120-day ban 
on refugees. That combines with--I am from the city of Houston. 
We have a large number refugees. For decades, we had a huge 
number of Iraqi refugees that came in after the war and on-
going. We have a huge number of Afghan refugees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. King">You just made a very valid point. I have watched. I have 
been in Mosul and I have watched the retaking. I was there in 
the bloody, let me not characterize, but as a Member in the 
after-effect of all the bloodiness that went on in those 
earlier times. But we know that Mosul has been a site. Here we 
have Iraqi military forces with certainly the technical help of 
our very fine military, moving forward and moving in these ISIS 
strongholds. This is miraculous and bloody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. King">    So, who knows what refugees may come out of that? We know 
that there are people who are interpreters and otherwise. But 
would you please answer the question of the far-reaching impact 
of an Executive Order impacting refugees, 120 days, possibly in 
fear of their life? Then just the general statement that the 
Executive Order makes, in terms of the United States' history 
of friendship with the Muslim world.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Thank you, Representative Lee. You know, I
would point to the indefinite ban of Syrian refugees----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Ms. Jackson Lee. Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Mr. Bergen [continuing]. Coming into this country. You 
know, this is a bad idea. We have accepted 15,000 Syrian 
refugees, there are 5 million of them. So we have taken 0.2 
percent. The last way you would want to get into this country 
as a terrorist is a Syrian refugee. It is the hardest way to 
get in. It takes 2 years; you give up all your biometric data, 
it is quite a process. There is no evidence of any Syrian 
refugee engaging in any form of terroristic activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Bergen">So this was a counterproductive idea and these people are 
victims of terrorism. They are the victims of State-sponsored 
terrorism by Assad and victims of ISIS. They are, 
overwhelmingly, women and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you. I am glad you mentioned Syrian 
and the Iraqi and refugees overall are impacted negatively by 
this, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but this 
Executive Order.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Agreed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Bergen">I yield back. Thank you Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Thank you to the Ranking Member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    Mr. King, I have some follow-up questions I will ask the 
entire panel. It looks as if we are achieving great success in 
Mosul. Assuming that success continues in Iraq and Syria, how 
much of threat do you think we face in this country from 
terrorists who were driven out of Iraq and Syria, and I would 
say the threat to Europe and to the United States, since you 
will have well-trained terrorists there? Is there going to be a 
problem with them coming? Putting aside the refugee issue and 
all, I am talking about people coming into the country.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Bergen">So far we see no ISIS-trained militants coming
into the United States and we have only seen eight people, 
Americans, returning from Syria. They have trained mostly with 
other groups. So the problem is going to be in Europe. And, 
yes, there will be a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Bergen">But, you know, ISIS is not the problem, it is a symptom of 
big problems that aren't going to be fixed very, anytime soon. 
We are going to see a son of ISIS and a grandson of ISIS if 
there is no political accommodation in Iraq and Syria, that 
produced ISIS in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    So, you know, we are going to be unfortunately testifying 
on this subject in the future if we can't solve the Syrian 
civil war and the Iraqi civil war, none of which is easy to do.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. King"> I guess my concern was the immediate one as far
as law enforcement and----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    Mr. King [continuing]. Counterterrorism in this country. 
How alert do we have to be to an increase, a possible increase 
or upsurge in terrorists coming either into Europe or the 
United States?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Bergen">I think it is particularly Europe. I mean, most
of the Americans who have gone--there are very few Americans 
that succeeded in getting to Syria. A lot of them have been 
killed over there. You know, the volume of Europeans is, you 
know, 6,900, I think, in total. The number of Americans who 
have even gotten to Syria is maybe 50, half of whom are 
probably dead by now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    So it is really the European problem and, of course, the 
problem in the Middle East, where, you know, probably, you 
know, more than 30,000 foreign fighters, not all of whom will 
get killed.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. King"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> So there will be this bleed-out problem.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. King"> Mr. Simcox.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simcox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Simcox">Yes, I think the European foreign fighter issue
is a very serious one for the United States. These foreign 
fighters, of course, some of them are going to be killed in 
trying to defend Raqqah and Mosul and other ISIS strongholds, 
but many will return to their countries of origin. This 
obviously presents a severe threat for Europeans and, of 
course, Americans living in Europe, of which there are over 
1\1/2\ million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Simcox">But you also have to think of the fact that European 
agencies, European security agencies around some of the 
countries especially impacted, Germany, Belgium, France, for 
example, are overwhelmed with the scale of the problem at the 
moment and they clearly would say themselves don't know who 
exactly has left the country and who exactly is going to be 
coming back in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Simcox">    Obviously, it is a lot easier for returnees, if they are 
not on the security radar, to travel to the United States from 
Brussels or Paris than it will be to go from Syria and Iraq. So 
I think you have to also think there is a potential threat to 
the United States from European returnees, not just in 
Americans abroad, but also in the U.S. homeland itself.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. King"> Mr. Joscelyn.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Well, this is why I always come back to al-
Qaeda. Of course, I am well versed in ISIS threat, but part of 
the discussion here is that the military intelligence and law 
enforcement of the United States has been dealing with 
potential al-Qaeda threats emanating from Syria for some time 
now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">There has been an uptick in airstrikes that have been 
deliberately targeting individuals who, according to the 
Defense Department, who, according to intelligence sources who 
talk to the press and make official statements, are involved in 
plotting against the West and specifically against the United 
States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Now, yes, it is difficult to get from Syria into the United 
States. It is much easier to get into Europe. They have all 
sorts of logistical problems in pulling off a major sort-of 
attack from there. But that doesn't mean they are not trying, 
it doesn't mean they are not probing, it doesn't mean that they 
don't want to eventually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Another factor here is that they have been very, very 
patient, and this is what makes me worried, in that they 
actually had a stand-down order for al-Qaeda in Syria for a 
couple years now where they were laying the groundwork for 
plots against the West, but they weren't given the green light 
for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Basically, it was they were focusing on the war against the 
Assad regime and building popular support for al-Qaeda's cause 
in Syria, very dangerous in the long run. You want to talk 
about having hearings for the coming future? That is the type 
of thing we will have hearings in the coming future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">    But the point is that as in Syria, as in elsewhere, a small 
part of their resources are devoted to anti-Western plotting. 
So far, I think the United States has disrupted quite a bit of 
that, but it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it is there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. King"> Commissioner.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Davis">I believe that the more successful the military
is in depriving these actors of their foreign lands, the more 
underground that they will go and they will attack us on two 
fronts. One through the internet, which I think we need to pay 
close attention to. The radicalization of our own people 
through the internet is an extreme problem that needs more 
robust defenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Davis">Then the other thing is we can't forget that 9/11 was a 
very sophisticated plot. Terrorists will follow the path of 
least resistance in launching their threats. So Europe has a 
bigger problem than we have, but we cannot discount it here. 
They will, if they go underground, they will launch attacks 
against us from foreign lands that we need to be vigilant 
about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Davis">    So at the same time that I believe trusting relationships 
with the people who live here are extremely important, it is 
also very important to have a good defense at our borders to 
keep out anybody who is intent on hurting our people.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. King">Thank you. I know I am over my time, but, Mr.
Bergen, if I could just engage you on the question of the seven 
countries. We can debate the ban separately, but as far as 
those seven countries, agreed, there has not been serious 
attacks in the past from those seven countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. King">But again, when legislation was first passed, I guess, in 
2015 to 2016 about taking away the visa waiver status of 
Europeans and we attempted to determine which countries had the 
most potential for danger in the future, we agreed on four 
countries, and that was agreed on with the President and the 
Congress and that was voted on. The administration itself added 
three countries to come to the seven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. King">Now, the Obama administration had the opportunity to add 
other countries, too, but it was the four that was agreed on 
with Congress and the administration. Then the administration 
added on the three as the countries which had the most 
potential danger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. King">Certainly, as far as, you know, the visa waiver is 
concerned and if we mention countries like Saudi Arabia, 
Pakistan, Egypt, we do have much better relationships now with 
their intelligence agencies than we had on 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. King">On these other countries, you have Iran who is an enemy, 
and you have certainly Iraq could be a separate issue, I agree. 
But the other countries, basically there is no intelligence 
agency, there is no intelligence structure. In many ways, they 
are broken governments. I think in only three of those 
countries, we even have embassies. So, to me, that was the 
logic that went into those seven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. King">    Again, we can discuss the ban itself, or the temporary ban, 
separately. But I think there is a logic to those seven 
countries. But I would appreciate your thoughts, as I always 
do.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Thank you, Chairman King. You know, I think it
was Jeff Flake and Senator Dianne Feinstein, who, you know, 
there is something that makes sense, which is if you are the 
citizen of a visa waiver country, which is almost invariably a 
Western country, and you have recently visited Syria and Iraq, 
yes, you should be the subject of scrutiny, and a number of 
these other countries. That makes sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Bergen">But just saying anybody who comes from these countries is a 
potential threat, that doesn't make, I mean, to me, that makes 
less sense. These countries are given a lot of scrutiny already 
if you are a citizen of these countries coming in to the United 
States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    So what was sensible was to say if you are a European who 
has in the past 5 years visited Syria or Iraq, well, you could 
be on a humanitarian mission, but you could also be joining 
ISIS. Giving those people extra scrutiny, I think, made a lot 
of sense. But just saying anybody from these countries is a 
potential terrorist, I think, is overdoing it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. King"> We could debate that. But again, to me, that was
the logic. They didn't include Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or 
Egypt or other countries, which maybe they could have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Yes, just to interject real quick. You know,
I agree with what Peter said about dealing with specific 
threats as opposed to just everybody. This isn't a defense of 
the travel ban. It has to be dealing with specific threats, as 
I said in my written testimony. Most of the refugee crisis is a 
humanitarian concern, not a counterterrorism concern, but there 
are counterterrorism concerns there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Just when you go back to sort-of the history, you know, 
until 
9/11, we didn't have an Egyptian, Lebanese, Saudis hijacked 
planes and fly them into buildings before 9/11, you know?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">So the threat was emanating from countries and these were 
foreign nationals who went and got trained in Afghanistan and 
then made their way through the West to come here. This is a 
very complex sort-of situation. It is not something that goes 
down to just sort-of a crude nationality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">In the terms of the seven, Congressmen, to sort-of just 
buttress your point a little bit, there is no doubt in my mind 
that some of preeminent threats to the U.S. security are 
emanating from Syria and Iraq today, also Yemen. We know AQAP 
has tried a number of times to launch attacks against us. 
Somalia, which is on the ban list, again, I am not defending 
the ban list, I think it is crude, but Somalia, there is a 
threat emanating there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Al-Qaeda has been experimenting with a very small explosive 
that they can slip onto planes. You heard Peter mention that 
possibility in one of the airports abroad, that they come into 
the United States, they have been experimenting with that type 
of explosive and they tried that in Somalia with a flight that 
came through Europe or was going to go through Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">So I think the countries, and Libya as well, I think there 
are clear, defined threats from most of these countries. Iran, 
of course, is the principal gateway for al-Qaeda to this day. 
This is another issue that is not really discussed very much, 
but the Obama administration between July 2011 and July 2016, 
on numerous occasions said that the core pipeline for al-
Qaeda's operations around the globe, including sending 
operatives to the West, goes through Iran. That is, of course, 
on the list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">    So the ban, to me, is clumsy, there are many problems with 
it. But in terms of understanding where the threats are coming 
from, at least a number of the countries on this list are 
rightfully under scrutiny. I think there are other countries, 
as well. But again, you know, most of the people coming from 
these countries are not terrorists, of course.

    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. King">Ranking Member for as much time as she wants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. King">    Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> it was recently reported that the President is
looking in his budget, he is going to be looking to increase 
military spending and part of that was going to be paid for by 
cutting foreign aid. Can you talk about what that would do and 
how that would affect National security?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Bergen">The $54 billion that the Trump administration
is seeking for the Department of Defense, I mean, probably some 
of that is justified. But if it is just simply going to buy, 
you know, things like the F-35 or other pieces of hardware that 
are highly expensive and not that relevant to the actual wars 
we are fighting on, I think the Pentagon itself is going to 
push back on some of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Because after all, it was Secretary Mattis who said, you 
know, that in 2013 that the State Department was essential. 
After all, we don't want to go to war, we want to stop wars 
before they happen. That is the job of the State Department. It 
is called diplomacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Bergen">So zeroing out foreign aid and basically, you know, kind-of 
gutting the State Department, I think, in the long term, is a 
terrible idea. I am not even certain that the Pentagon 
necessarily--of course, they want money for veterans and other 
things like that, but I don't think there is a huge demand 
signal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Bergen">This seems to be more of a campaign promise that just sort-
of willy-nilly has been fulfilled without doing a lot of 
careful consideration about what are we trying to achieve and 
how to do we best try and achieve it rather than just saying we 
are just going to increase 10 percent to the Department of 
Defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Miss Rice. Well, I actually think that it was Secretary 
Mattis before he became Secretary who said how critical foreign 
aid is in terms of maintaining calm and peace throughout the 
countries in areas that are, you know, that are in volatile 
areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Bergen">While having a robust military is obviously very important, 
from a diplomatic standpoint, from a non-interventionist 
standpoint, military interventionist standpoint, that that 
foreign aid to all of our allies across the globe is critically 
essential to maintaining that kind of world order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    Would you agree that, Mr. Bergen?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Bergen">I mean, we spend 1 percent of our budget is on
foreign aid. So as a percentage of the budget, it is very, very 
small. Of course, sometimes it is misspent; I mean, we can't 
pretend otherwise. But the idea that it should be zeroed out, 
it doesn't make sense because sometimes it is misspent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    Miss Rice. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. King"> The gentleman from Pennsylvania.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Perry">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Perry">Mr. Bergen, in your written testimony you claimed that New 
America, which is the organization that you are employed with, 
right, has collected data on 399 individuals accused of 
jihadist terrorism-related crime since 9/11 and the research 
shows that of the 94 people killed by jihadist terrorists 
inside the United States since that time, not a single death 
would have been prevented by the travel ban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Perry">Now, to me, this obviously ignores a number of attempted, 
failed, or less-than-lethal terror attacks that have been 
perpetrated by persons from these seven countries. I am just 
going to name a few here. A Somali refugee Abdul Razak Ali 
Artan went on a jihadi stabbing rampage at Ohio State. An Iraqi 
refugee Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan was accused of planning to 
bomb a local mall in Texas. A Somali refugee named Dahir Adan 
went on a stabbing spree in a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota. A 
Somali refugee was arrested for planning to blow up a Christmas 
tree lighting ceremony in Oregon in 2010. An Iraqi refugee 
bombed a Social Security office in Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Perry">    So the question is, would the Executive Order protecting 
the Nation currently, well, as proposed, from foreign terrorist 
entry into the United States, had it been in place prior to 
these individuals coming, would it have prevented those 
instances?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Also in my testimony, sir, as you may have
noticed, I mentioned some of these cases. In the case of the 
Ohio State attack, he actually came from Pakistan. He was a 
Somali refugee who went to Pakistan when he was a child. So did 
his radicalization take place in Pakistan, which is not on the 
ban? Did his radicalization take here in the United States?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Bergen">I mean, it raises the broader issue of, when children come 
to this country as refugees, are we going to ban them because 
10 years from now they might become terrorists?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    For instance, in the 1920's and 1930's, would it have been 
our policy to say, well, if you are from Sicily, which millions 
of people came to this country from, you know, because there 
was a possibility you might become a member of the mafia 10 
years down the road, we are not going to let you in. This is 
the logic of this ban, it doesn't make sense.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Perry"> Well, I don't necessarily agree with you on
that, and I don't necessarily see it as a ban either, as more 
of a resetting to understand and make sure that the vetting 
process is correct and appropriate. It seems, in a way, that 
you are advocating for unless there is broad and wide-scale 
mayhem and destruction that we need to be reactive as opposed 
to proactive.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> Of course I am not advocating that. What I am
saying is the problem is an American domestic problem. I mean, 
every lethal terrorist attack in this country has been carried 
out by an American citizen or a legal permanent resident. I 
mean the issue is radicalization here, not----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Perry">But it seems to fly in the face. I mean, if the
police are searching for a serial killer, but something 
requires them to look at the whole panoply of everybody that 
was killed in the city, doesn't it kind of fly in the face that 
you need to focus your efforts on the things that make sense 
that connect and are common to the acts that are committed. The 
things that are common, you have to focus your efforts there 
because that tells the story of maybe why, who, how, these 
things are happening?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Perry">    If we just say, well, these things are happening everywhere 
and there is no commonality of origin or ideology, I think we 
are going to miss the mark.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> Are you suggesting that we should ban travel
from France?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Perry">No, I am not suggesting that. But I am
suggesting that some countries, some geography have a higher 
incidence and just like, as the Chairman said, the 
administration prior to this one recognized the exact same 
thing. As it is stated, as you call it, a ban, to me, it is 
just a timeout to make sure that we are doing everything we 
can, appropriately, regarding the countries that we find most 
at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Perry">It is essentially just renewing your insurance policy and 
looking at the risks that you have; as opposed to being 
reactive, we are being proactive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Perry">    Let me just move on a little bit regarding the Muslim 
Brotherhood and designating them. I am sure you are familiar 
with the Holy Land Foundation investigation and civilization 
jihad, right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Perry">So because we have relations and relationships
with countries that recognize the Muslim Brotherhood, most 
recently, I am sure you are aware that Egypt, although 
democratically elected, rejected the Muslim Brotherhood and 
listed them themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Perry">    But, you know we have had conversations with the likes of 
Saddam Hussein, the Castro regime, the North Koreans; 
meanwhile, we designate them in some effect as hostile actors. 
Can we not have our cake and eat it, too? Can we not recognize 
that these individuals and these organizations have a design to 
overturn our Government, our way of life in some cases and in 
many cases, even though that they are on the world stage and 
are world actors and we must have a relationship and some kind 
of dialog with them, but to understand what their clear 
intentions are take action regarding their intentions?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> I think conflating the North Korean government
with the Muslim Brotherhood is to make a category error.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Perry"> OK. Go ahead.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Bergen">After all, I mean, Muslim Brotherhood is the
government or part of the government in many of our closest 
allies. I mean, are you going to criminalize the leaders of the 
Iraqi government who are helping us in Mosul?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Are you going to criminalize the Jordanian members of 
Parliament who are members of the Muslim Brotherhood? Or the 
Kuwaiti members of Parliament who are members of the Muslim 
Brotherhood?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    Are we going to behave like the Egyptian dictatorship, el-
Sisi, who criminalized the largest opposition party in his own 
country? Are you endorsing that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Perry">What I am endorsing is is that the United States
needs to be vigilant regarding individuals and organizations 
that seek our destruction and our downfall and acting like as 
they wander among us in town that they don't have that intent 
when they have shown that very express intent, is suicidal, is 
suicidal for a nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Perry">While it might not be the best vehicle, I think it raises 
the bar and puts those organizations on notice that we 
understand what their intentions are. Though we might have to 
deal with them, and we should deal with them for the good of 
mankind, we understand and recognize and disagree with their 
intentions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Perry">    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. King"> Mr. Keating.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Keating">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Keating">As a district attorney before I was here, I was very 
concerned on gender violence issues, particularly sexual 
assault, domestic violence. The National Task Force on Ending 
Sexual and Domestic Violence recently stated that the Executive 
Order would endanger the safety of victims of sexual assault, 
domestic violence, and human trafficking, their families and 
communities at large, further isolate victims and erect 
barriers to establish legal protections for those victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Mr. Bergen, can you comment on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Bergen"> I don't actually know, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. Keating">Any of our panelists can comment on that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Keating">All right, I just wanted to also--we are making great 
success shrinking the footprint militarily with ISIL. One of 
the things that we are also making great success with that is 
probably less publicized is the way we are shrinking their 
financing as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Mr. Keating">We are doing it with our elimination of their oil 
refineries and resources. They are doing it as we shrink the 
land because they can't tax the way that they could before. The 
other two issues are really the use of hostages and ransom and 
the trading illegally in antiquities and cultural artifacts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Mr. Keating">    How are we doing on those other points? I know we are doing 
well, you know, on shrinking the footprint, which again deals 
with the taxing issue. But if you could just comment on how we 
are doing on those fronts.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bergen</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. Bergen">Very well, ISIS has halved its salaries. You
know, we dropped a big bomb, the United States, on one of their 
banks where they had a lot of their money in. The New York Post 
had one of the best headlines of all time, ``United States 
Makes Big Deposit.'' So we have really kind-of, you know, they 
are running a 30,000-man, 20,000-man army, it costs money. We 
have really put a hurt on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Bergen">    They are running and one of the reasons we are seeing child 
soldiers, by the way, now is they are running out of manpower. 
We are seeing more and more child soldiers. So I think the 
approach is working, they are slowly being strangled.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Keating"> OK, yes?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simcox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Simcox">I think one of the key things on the kidnap-
for-ransom issue is making sure that everybody is on the same 
page because are some countries which take this very seriously 
in terms of not paying kidnap money to ISIS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Simcox">The United States takes it very seriously, the United 
Kingdom takes it very seriously. Some of the United States' 
European allies have been harder to persuade and actually are 
paying kidnap ransom money. ISIS and al-Qaeda are the groups 
who are able to sustain themselves because of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Simcox">    Also, when you look, I think I agree entirely with Peter on 
some of the progress that is being made in the Middle East. But 
remember, some of the ISIS cells in Europe, for example, are 
kind-of, I mean, some of these are lower-level criminals who 
have got other ways of fundraising, you know, something closer 
aligned with criminal gangs and gangsters. So there are 
multiple problems that we need to be aware of.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">You know, there were some designations by the
U.S. Government last year dealing in the aftermath of 
counterterrorism raids against ISIS in Deir ez-Zor and the 
leadership there where what the documentation that was 
recovered showed extensive trading in antiquities from Palmyra 
and elsewhere in Syria and Iraq on the black market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">It is very difficult to get a sense of what the total 
income is from this activity because it is illicit, because it 
is in the black market, and there were many trades that were 
discovered during those rates that were unknown. You know, 
there were the artifacts that were basically being put up on 
the block that were previously unknown to be in their 
possession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">So it is very difficult in that aspect, which is only one 
of many of their revenues they are bringing in, to get a good 
sense of just how prolific they have been and perhaps could be 
in the future. I do think overall their finances have 
absolutely been hurt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">On the kidnapping for ransom, again, you know, I know I am 
the al-Qaeda guy, I will keep coming back to it, but this is 
one of those areas where they been a little more sophisticated 
than ISIS in terms of getting kidnapping for ransoms because 
they have been able to maintain friendly relations with certain 
Gulf countries that have basically brokered very lucrative 
deals for them at times for U.N. people who were kidnapped near 
the Golan Heights, U.N. workers, and employees for high-profile 
Americans and others where they have been able to trade for 
millions and millions of dollars and earn ransoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">    This is part of their strategy all the way from West 
Africa, all the way to South Asia and through the heart of the 
Middle East. So it is something to keep an eye on. As Robin 
said, some countries are good on it, others, a lot of them in 
fact, are not. So that is part of the problem.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Keating">So that is something we should work with our
friends then. I have another question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Oh, yes, did you want to talk about that, Mr. Davis? Sorry.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Davis"> I just wanted to mention that beyond kinetic
weapons, the financial investigations and also shutting down of 
these websites or targeting people who are responsible for 
them, who are activating people in our country has been very 
effective.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Keating"> Good point.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Davis</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Davis"> I don't understand why we can't shut down their
magazines, why pursuing that on the internet and immediately 
shutting down the publications of these magazines that extol 
this radicalism and attacks against us couldn't be done more 
frequently.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Mr. Keating">Yes. It wasn't long ago that I was in Tunisia,
and here is the concern I have. Tunisia, as I think most of you 
know, has the highest per-capita number of foreign terrorist 
fighters, and they are coming back. Some of them going back to 
Libya, but some, you know, many are coming right back to 
Tunisia which is a pretty fragile country right now and they 
are not alone, but I will use them as an example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Keating">When we are cutting, as a country, our ability to help 
countries like that that are in crisis at this point, how 
dangerous is that, to do that? Because you have got a fragile 
country, you have got a high amount now of returning foreign 
terrorist fighters that they don't know how to deal with, 
according to reports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Keating">    This is a great example how the United States, I believe, 
intervention there to help that country, you know, through the 
State side could be so critical and keep us safer. Would you 
like to comment on the need of doing that and why maybe making 
sure we have funding to help at these critical times is 
important?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Simcox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Mr. Simcox">Yes. Tunisia is obviously a very clear country
of concern. Actually, I was speaking to the German government 
recently who, one of their main concerns at the moment is, they 
have lots of Tunisians in Germany that they regard as a threat, 
who shouldn't be there, trying to deport back to Tunisia, and 
Tunisia is saying we just don't want them back. Right?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Simcox">    I mean, they already feel as if they are a threat. They are 
already under severe, you know, terrorist alert as it is. So I 
think that is an area where the United States has got to take 
the lead in helping coordinate that kind of thing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Keating">Well, thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Are you done, Mr. Joscelyn?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Joscelyn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">Can I just add here on Tunisia? I mean, that
basically this is one of the few countries to come out of the 
Arab uprisings that has a chance actually for a better future 
at this point. You know, I think that America should scale up 
its efforts to support the Tunisian forces there instead of the 
opposite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">You know, the Tunisian case as a country, I am sorry, is 
inextricably linked to Libya and the flow of fighters back and 
forth, which basically if you start looking at the whole 
situation, if we are not bolstering Tunisia, then we start to 
allow them to have greater operating access across North 
Africa, you know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Mr. Joscelyn">    So Tunisia is one of those key countries right now. Any 
strategist looking at the jihadi threat has to look at Tunisia 
as sort-of a key roadblock possibly to what the jihadis are 
doing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Mr. Keating"> Great. Thank you very much.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. King">OK. First of all, let me thank the witnesses for
their testimony. I think this was a very worthwhile hearing, 
testimony was very illuminating, and I think the dialog between 
the Members and the witnesses was very constructive. So I want 
to thank you really for your testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. King">Thank you for all the work you have done with the committee 
in the past, and hopefully we can see you again the future. Any 
advice you have for us along the way, any input, we certainly 
welcome it, including yours, Mr. Bergen, really.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Mr. King">    [Laughter.]

    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. King">No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. King">Thank you all very much. With that the hearing stands 
adjourned.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. King">----------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. King">Questions From Honorable Mike Gallagher for Edward F. Davis, III</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. King">Question 1. Significant American aid dollars, mostly in the form of 
U.S. SF and intelligence assets, has assisted Nigeria in scoring 
several battlefield victories against Boko Haram in recent years. 
However, given not just the frequency of mass kidnappings, but the 
inability to locate these Nigerian victims and secure their release, 
what further support does Nigeria need both from a military and civil 
society standpoint, to ensure they can secure their own borders and the 
safety of their people without significant and indefinite U.S. aid?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. King">Answer. My current work as a National and international security 
consultant includes the field of domestic terrorism. Boko Haram is an 
example of world-wide terror organization that needs to be defeated. 
Beyond that I have no insight on what type of support is needed to 
insure Nigeria can secure their own borders and the safety of their 
people without significant and indefinite U.S. aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. King">Question 2a. Last month, Pakistan's military approved a 10-year, 
121 billion-rupee ($1.77 billion) development package for formal 
integration of the Federally-Administered Tribal Areas into the Khyber 
province. The plan needs approval from Pakistan's Federal Cabinet, but, 
given the military' s support of the plan, this approval is seen as a 
formality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. King">Taking into account the FATA' s history of local governance, tribal 
politics, and active militants, how does Islamabad's decision 
potentially impact Pakistani militant groups?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. King">Question 2b. Could we see an uptick in attacks from the Pakistani 
Taliban and LeT within Pakistan or/and would we see the groups pushed 
out of Pakistan back into Afghanistan and become an even greater threat 
to Afghan and American forces?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. King">Answer. I do not have insight on 2(a) or 2(b).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. King">Question 3a. Are we now looking at social media for visa and 
refugee applicants to understand better any potential threats or 
dangers?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. King">What are the impediments and do you see a coordinated effort 
between the intelligence community, law enforcement, and State 
Department on a common approach?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. King">Question 3b. What are the data and privacy concerns attached to any 
of this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. King">Answer. Social media is a critical component of effective 
background screening. Open-source reviews are an important part of a 
comprehensive background screening. A coordinated effort between the 
intelligence community, law enforcement and the State Department makes 
abundant sense in this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. King">There are data and privacy concerns attached to data sourced via 
internet. These concerns are well-founded. However, open-source data is 
and should be accessible to all. It would be negligent in today's world 
not to search open-source information as part of background screenings 
and intelligence gathering. All searches should adhere to Federal and 
State law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. King">Question 4. Given your experience as Commissioner of a large urban 
police department that would frequently work with the FBI, how can 
local law enforcement, in conjunction with the FBI's Minneapolis Field 
Office and other relevant Federal agencies, work to prevent both self-
radicalization and formal jihadi recruitment of members of the Somali 
diaspora, particularly in the large cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. King">Answer. Federal, State, and local law enforcement should work 
together using a community policing approach to conduct outreach to the 
Somali diaspora. They can schedule cross-jurisdictional meetings within 
communities where radicalization is most prevalent, to discuss issues, 
concerns, and establish relationships. Building relationships with all 
community groups is critical to finding solutions and receiving 
meaningful intelligence to thwart radicalization and attacks. The 
attendees of these meetings should include community members who bring 
different perspectives to the table. The meetings should go beyond 
community members who regularly attend community meetings. This is very 
important to encourage a vigorous discussion of the issues and work to 
establish trust with the entire community.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. King">Questions From Honorable Mike Gallagher for Robin Simcox</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. King">Answer. The Nigerian army and the rest of the multinational 
coalition fighting Boko Haram have made significant tactical gains 
against the group. However, sustainable progress requires that the 
Nigerian government implement a strategy that discredits the ideology 
that motivates Boko Haram's leadership and some of its recruits, and 
ameliorates the environment that facilitates Boko Haram recruitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. King">The U.S. Government can help Nigeria by increasing--in keeping with 
relevant American law--its tactical support to the Nigerian military, 
including ISR, training, and appropriate equipment. The United States 
should also insist on the importance of, and help the Nigerians build, 
strong and transparent security institutions critical to creating and 
sustaining the accountable, competent, and law-abiding force necessary 
for long-term success against Boko Haram and similar groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. King">The United States should, in tandem, provide direct support to 
competent Nigerian civil society organizations, especially those in 
Boko Haram-affected areas, working on counter-radicalization, rule of 
law, and economic-development initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. King">Question 2a. Last month, Pakistan's military approved a 10-year, 
121 billion-rupee ($1.77 billion) development package for formal 
integration of the Federally-Administered Tribal Areas into the Khyber 
province. The plan needs approval from Pakistan's Federal Cabinet, but, 
given the military' s support of the plan, this approval is seen as a 
formality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. King">Taking into account the FATA' s history of local governance, tribal 
politics, and active militants, how does Islamabad's decision 
potentially impact Pakistani militant groups?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. King">Answer. The plan to integrate Pakistan's Federally-Administered 
Tribal Areas (FATA) into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province is a 
welcome and long overdue step. The plan to scrap the outdated Frontier 
Crimes Regulation (FCR) and replace it with a code of law based on 
personal, rather than collective, responsibility will help protect 
individual rights. Furthermore, extending the jurisdiction of the 
Pakistani High Court and Supreme Court to the FATA and allowing the 
people of the region to participate in national elections will ensure 
they enjoy full and equal rights under the Pakistani Constitution. 
These political changes, along with the economic development package 
for the region, is critical to ensuring FATA does not remain a hotbed 
for terrorism. It also signals a change in mindset of the Pakistani 
military, which had long resisted incorporating the FATA into Pakistan 
proper, most likely to protect certain militant groups that operated 
there. Following through on the political and economic changes for FATA 
will help the military and civilian leadership consolidate the gains 
against the Tehrik-e-Taliban-Pakistan (TTP) made during Operation Zarb-
e-Azb.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. King">The outlook regarding the future of the anti-India Lashkar-e-Taiba 
(LeT) militant group is less certain. This group retains links to 
Pakistan's security establishment and is still perceived to be a useful 
tool against India among most Pakistani military and intelligence 
officials. While Pakistan recently took a positive first step against 
LeT by putting under house arrest the group's founder, Hafiz Muhammad 
Saeed, there have been no other tangible signs that Islamabad is 
reining in the group's operations. The major LeT compound at Muridke, 
outside Lahore, remains unaffected and there has been no information 
about LeT training camps or funding sources being shut down. Only time 
will tell if Pakistan is serious about also reining in the LeT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. King">Question 2b. Could we see an uptick in attacks from the Pakistani 
Taliban and LeT within Pakistan or/and would we see the groups pushed 
out of Pakistan back into Afghanistan and become an even greater threat 
to Afghan and American forces?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. King">Answer. Large numbers of TTP militants have already moved across 
the border into Afghanistan as a result of the Zarb-e-Azb military 
operation. Some of these militants have rebranded themselves as members 
of the Islamic State (ISIS). The Afghan forces, with support from U.S. 
forces, have targeted these bases, mostly found in the eastern Afghan 
province of Nangahar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. King">There is some concern following the string of attacks in Pakistan 
last month (including a major attack on a Sufi shrine that killed 
nearly 80) that TTP elements have been able to regroup inside Pakistan. 
A renewed push by the Pakistan military to crack down on terrorism, 
including sending 2,000 Pakistan Army Rangers into the Punjab province, 
is aimed at stamping out the residual terrorist networks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. King">Question 3a. Are we now looking at social media for visa and 
refugee applicants to understand better any potential threats or 
dangers?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. King">What are the impediments and do you see a coordinated effort 
between the intelligence community, law enforcement, and State 
Department on a common approach?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. King">Question 3b. What are the data and privacy concerns attached to any 
of this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. King">Answer. The United States is looking at social media in a select 
manner for visa applicants and travelers to the United States. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has ordered consular officials 
responsible for conducting visa interviews to undertake ``mandatory 
social media check[s] for applicants present in a territory at the time 
it was controlled by ISIS.'' In applying through the electronic system 
for travel authorization (ESTA) to come to the United States through 
the Visa Waiver Program, travelers now have the option to provide some 
of their social media information. DHS has also tested multiple social 
media screening pilot programs but was criticized by the DHS inspector 
general for poor objective setting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. King">(a) Resources are certainly a potential impediment. There are two 
primary ways to engage in social media vetting: Self-reporting and 
open-source intelligence gathering from the internet. Self-reporting 
may allow a targeted search of an individual's accounts but ultimately 
relies on the truthfulness of the applicant. Have they provided all 
their accounts to authorities? Have they provided false accounts? 
Solving such problems may ultimately require that officials resort to 
the second option of searching the internet. Unfortunately, finding 
each social media account belonging to every applicant's social media 
accounts seems to be a resource-intensive process. It also is no 
guarantee that searches of social media accounts on the internet will 
be able to find the ones belonging to the applicant in question. This 
is not to say that social media should never be used--but that mass 
collection of social media may be more trouble than it is worth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. King">(b) If passwords are collected to access social media accounts then 
there are certainly concerns regarding how that data will be secured 
from hackers or insiders. It would be a gold mine to keep all those 
passwords in one place and would be targeted for malicious purposes. 
Another concern to consider is that U.S. citizens could be subject to 
reciprocal or retaliatory measures when entering other nations that 
could pose a threat to the privacy and security of American travelers' 
data.</paragraph>
