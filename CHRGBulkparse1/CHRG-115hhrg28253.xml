        <Plocation> mostly the Virgin Islands </Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>and Puerto Rico</Pname>
        <Plocation> have found themselves with formulas and cost </Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>shares in the past that have dramatically impacted</Pname>
        <Plocation> I would say </Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>punitively impacted</Pname>

        <Plocation>territories.</Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>As the chairman pointed out</Pname>
        <Plocation> and as we do quite often on </Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>the Appropriations Committee</Pname>
        <Plocation> we are trying to equalize that </Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>all across-the-board</Pname>
        <Plocation> not just in our Appropriations </Plocation>

        <Plocation> but in others.</Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>So when it comes to waivers and cost-sharing</Pname>
        <Plocation> I would hope </Plocation>

    <people>
        <Pname>that the Department of Insular Affairs would work with us to </Pname>
        <Plocation>that the Department of Insular Affairs would work with us to </Plocation>

        <Pname>point out where these inequities and these injustices lie</Pname>
        <Plocation> so </Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>that we can do something about it. Also</Pname>
        <Plocation> as the chairman </Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>pointed out</Pname>
        <Plocation> the Administration must take into account that </Plocation>

    <people>
        <Pname>many of our fellow citizens in these territories</Pname>
        <Plocation> their </Plocation>

        <Plocation> cannot do these waivers. </Plocation>
    </people>
    <people>
        <Pname>So it sounds good on paper</Pname>
