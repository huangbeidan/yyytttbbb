    <opening>STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH KNEEBONE, FELLOW, METROPOLITAN POLICY</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="ELIZABETH KNEEBONE">                 PROGRAM, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. KNEEBONE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Davis, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you so much for the 
opportunity to testify today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">This morning, I am going to spend some time giving a brief 
overview of the changing geography of poverty, including its 
growth into new and different areas. I will talk about some of 
the factors that have led to the shifts we have seen in recent 
years, some of the challenges that have accompanied those 
trends, and, finally, some of the implications for efforts to 
effectively address poverty across different kinds of 
communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">Let's start with the numbers. The 2000s saw poverty grow 
rapidly in the U.S., and even with the declines we have seen in 
recent years, by 2015 we still had 43.1 million people living 
below the Federal poverty line, or 13.5 percent of the 
population. That is almost 6 million more people than before 
the recession began in 2007 and 11-1/2 million more people than 
in 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">When we think about poverty in the United States, we often 
think about it in the urban context or as a rural challenge, 
because that is where it has historically been concentrated, 
and as poverty grew in the 2000s, it continued to grow in those 
places. But it grew at an even faster pace outside of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">So, between 2000 and 2015, in big cities and in rural 
communities the poor population grew by about 20 percent. In 
smaller metropolitan areas, it grew at twice that pace. And the 
fastest pace of growth actually took place in suburbs of our 
major metropolitan areas, which saw their poor population grow 
by 57 percent. All told, suburbs accounted for about half of 
the total increase in the Nation's poor population over that 
time period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">Now, poverty rates remain higher in cities and in rural 
communities, but today more poor people live in suburbs. In 
2015, 16 million people in suburbs lived below the poverty 
line--3 million more than in big cities, that is 6 million more 
than in smaller metropolitan areas, and 8 million more than in 
rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">So why does that happen? What caused these historic shifts? 
Well, in some cases, it is because more poor people moved to 
the suburbs for any number of reasons: following job 
opportunities, which continue to suburbanize; shifting trends 
in where affordable housing is located within regions; or just 
following the amenities that the suburbs offered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">But more so and an even bigger part of this puzzle was 
actually the downward mobility of long-term suburban residents 
over time. Part of that is because of the two economic 
recessions we saw in the 2000s, particularly the severity of 
the Great Recession. But it is not just about downturns; it is 
also about structural changes in the economy that have led to 
the growing prevalence of low-wage work. And that saw the 
typical household income fall even before the Great Recession 
hit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">So why does it matter that all of these forces together 
have pushed poverty up and into more and different places? 
Partly it is because the places that have seen poverty grow 
fastest often were not built nor are they now equipped to deal 
with the levels of need which they are seeing today. Many 
suburbs don't have the kinds of infrastructure, like public 
transit, or support services, like a robust nonprofit safety 
net, that cities have been able to evolve and develop over 
decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">And overcoming those gaps is challenged by the fact that 
suburbs stretch over a really fragmented jurisdictional map. 
There are several jurisdictions, many of them quite small, that 
make up the suburbs and are just too small on their own and 
lack the capacity to marshal responses at the scale of need 
that they are seeing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">Also, they lack resources, partly because resources have 
lagged this rapid change in the geography of poverty, both in 
terms of philanthropic support and in terms of Federal and 
government investments in places. Some of that is because of 
the lack of capacity in these places. They are not able to 
compete to effectively bring resources into their communities. 
Some of it is by design, by the way that these funding sources 
were designed, with a different geography of poverty in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">Clearly, more resources are needed to deal with the scale 
and reach of need that we see today, but even just marshaling 
and more effectively using the limited resources we have will 
require that we get to a more effective scale so we can help 
more people in more places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">There are communities across the country that are already 
finding ways to do this. Often it is through collaboration, 
whether it is suburbs coming together to work across suburban 
jurisdictional boundaries, suburbs working with central cities 
to address shared challenges, or suburban communities joining 
with their rural neighbors to work on common issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">All of these sorts of strategies and models share a desire 
and effort to get to that better scale, to use these limited 
resources more effectively and in ways that can help more 
people in more places. But they are fighting an uphill battle 
to do that in the current context.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">So the way that the Federal Government could be a strong 
partner here, could align resources more effectively to support 
these types of strategies and help scale up these types of 
responses would be: one, to explicitly incentivize 
collaborative strategies that cut across jurisdictions, that 
cut across policy silos; that could, number two, catalyze 
regional capacity to try and help overcome some of these 
capacity gaps in these communities through these more 
regionally scaled entities and efforts; and three, finally, 
allowing for more experimentation and evaluation to show what 
can work at the regional level and across different types of 
communities to connect more people and places to opportunity.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF MARK PARTRIDGE, PROFESSOR, SWANK CHAIR IN RURAL-</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MARK PARTRIDGE">So thank you, Ms. Kneebone. Mr. Partridge, you may begin.
 URBAN POLICY, DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="MARK PARTRIDGE">        DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. PARTRIDGE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Thank you, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member
Davis, and other members. I am Mark Partridge. My views reflect 
my research and not those of The Ohio State University. Today, 
I will discuss the diversity of rural poverty in rural America 
and describe ways to reduce poverty and its harmful effects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Much of rural America struggles from low commodity prices 
and fierce foreign competition, yet portrayals of the death of 
rural America are misleading. Dating back to 1970s, net 
migration in and out of rural America has been about zero with 
urban America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">In reality, there are three rural Americas. It is very 
diverse: one, fast-growing, high-amenity regions near lakes, 
oceans, and mountains; two, metro-adjacent rural communities 
with access to urban jobs and services; and, three, remote or 
extractive-based communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Rural America's industrial structure is becoming closer to 
urban America. So can we show Figure 1?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">For example, Figure 1 shows the shift from the farm 
economy. From 1969 to 2015, the rural farm employment share 
declined from 15 to 6 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Rural poverty rates are greater than urban rates. 2014 
urban and poverty rates were respectively 15 and 18 percent. 
But rural poverty receives relatively little attention. One 
reason is distance from media centers. Another is that it is 
hidden and rarely concentrated in poor neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Poverty greatly declined from 1959 to 1973. Poverty, 
though, is very geographically persistent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Next figures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Figures 4 and 6 from my written testimony show the 1979 and 
2015 county poverty rates for the lower 48 States, and the maps 
look very similar is my point. High-poverty clusters exist in 
central Appalachia, the Black Belt, Mississippi Delta, Rio 
Grande, and Western Native American reservations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Children are disproportionately in poverty. One-fourth of 
rural children and over one-fifth of urban children are 
afflicted. Fewer opportunities for poor children perpetuate an 
intergenerational poverty cycle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Rural policy won't succeed by the next election or save 
every struggling town, yet two broad approaches are available. 
First are people-based policies that directly support the poor, 
including education and training. The second is place-based 
policies in which poor locales receive more aid. Examples 
include infrastructure and firm attraction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">But promoting prosperous rural communities requires 
building from within. Communities possess many entrepreneurial 
and human resources. Research finds the fastest growing U.S. 
firms exist everywhere, from small towns to large cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Also, higher shares of small businesses and self-employment 
support faster future growth. Self-employment and other small-
business multipliers are double those of regular employment. 
There are many reasons. Small businesses buy more inputs 
locally, more profits remain local, and small-business 
development promotes a virtual cycle of promoting even more 
business formation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Small businesses can be fostered by reducing regulatory 
compliance costs. Another is improve small-firm financing. 
Small-business programs should be expanded through community 
colleges and State extension programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">The best predictor of future regional growth is the initial 
level of education. Yet rural America is less educated. Young 
talented adults from the countryside have long been captivated 
by bright city lights, but rural communities possess many 
charms--quiet, safe streets, sense of community and same 
lifestyles. Once former rural residents marry and have 
children, rural life becomes attractive. Thus, attraction 
efforts should be on enticing families in 30s and 40s back to 
rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Rural communities can compete by promoting safety, 
recreation, and a clean environment. Yet good public schools 
are paramount, not only for the children, but the parents that 
are attracted by quality schools are much coveted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Deficient rural public services harm the poor. Fortunately, 
there are low-cost ways to improve service delivery. 
Governments can provide seed funding for rural counties to 
share personnel and resources, for example. To build capacity, 
Congress should fully fund Federal-State regional development 
organizations and create new ones--for example, the Appalachian 
Regional Commission, ARC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Yet poor funding hampers the ARC's efforts. Still, the ARC 
has accomplished much with modest resources. It provides bridge 
loans and seed grants for infrastructure and other programs, 
but it mainly brokers regional collaborations that cannot be 
done by one poor community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Other policies should be expanded regardless of residents. 
For one, the Earned Income Tax Credit provides employment 
incentives. Early childhood education is also valuable, as is 
workforce training, access to transportation, mental health 
provision, and child care. They should be tailored to account 
for world differences. Accessibility is problematic, and 
services are stretched as many communities are struggling 
economically and are afflicted by drug crises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">In sum, with long, steady, patient effort, rural poverty 
can be greatly reduced, producing tremendous benefits for 
families, communities, and the American economy.</paragraph>

 TOWN PROJECT, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS; ACCOMPANIED BY LINDA THOMAS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="WILLIAM LEAVY">DIRECTOR OF CLIENT SERVICES, GREATER WEST TOWN PROJECT,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="WILLIAM LEAVY">                       CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Thank you. My name is Bill Leavy. I am the
executive director and founder of the Greater West Town 
Community Development Project on Chicago's west side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">My agency is very honored to have been asked by Chairman 
Smith and especially Congressman Davis to testify today to 
deepen public understanding of the extent and impact of poverty 
in urban communities and to share our experience using 
community-based job training to combat poverty at the 
individual and community level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Our experience has shown us that intensive occupational 
skills training in partnership with local industry is a highly 
effective way to get people into quality career-track jobs and 
help them lift themselves out of poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">I am very honored to be with Linda Thomas here today, our 
director of client services. She is here to answer specific 
questions you have about our program and the challenges we 
face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Greater West Town is a community-based economic development 
initiative dedicated to expanding education and economic 
opportunity for the low-income, primarily minority community 
residents of the greater west side of Chicago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">We achieve that mission by providing comprehensive 
workforce development and educational services through a model 
community-business partnership strategy that links the 
employment and training needs of neighborhood job seekers to 
local economic development efforts and the workforce needs of 
area companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Greater West Town services include occupational skills 
training in the high-growth industries of woodworking and 
shipping and receiving, job placement support services, and, 
very importantly, an alternative high school for youth that 
have dropped out in our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Greater West Town's programs are focused also to help meet 
the needs of local employers for the skilled and motivated 
workers they need to stay and grow in the area while competing 
successfully in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Greater West Town's target populations include ex-
offenders, welfare-eligible single parents, homeless, 
dislocated workers, high school dropouts, and teen parents. 
More than 1,800 graduates of the woodworking and shipping and 
receiving programs have been placed in jobs with area 
companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Our targeted community areas have historically been--I am 
going skip this because Danny has covered the poverty in our 
neighborhood so well. Danny, I couldn't do it any more or any 
better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">I think my only point that I would like make is that there 
are major racial barriers in the labor market, and we need to 
admit them and deal with then. Unemployment rates for black men 
are disproportionally high. In Chicago, black men are twice as 
likely to be unemployed as Latinos and three times as likely to 
be unemployed as whites. So it might be controversial for you 
guys, but it is there. If you look at the numbers, it is 
jumping off the page at us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">And, of course, a major barrier to finding jobs in our 
community--so many ex-offenders come back into our community. 
Our communities are disproportionately receiving ex-offenders 
as they leave prison. And, of course, our high-school dropout 
crisis is a huge, huge problem and barrier to economic 
opportunity. Our neighborhood high schools have reported 
dropout rates of up to 50 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Our occupational skills training is a proven and highly 
effective model that provides employment opportunities to high-
need populations. The program is designed and operated in 
collaboration with local employer partners. Our employment 
strategy, training strategy combines a bridge program with 
basic skills remediation, and that leads to a hard skills 
program, an occupational certificate program. And it is by 
getting folks into that occupational certificate program that 
we get them access to higher-skilled, higher-paid jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Greater West Town meets employer needs by providing 
trained, dependable, motivated workers. And we give employers 
special value-added labor force development services that the 
companies cannot provide or undertake on their own. Many local 
firms credit our programs for their manufacturing success and 
cite it as an important factor in their decision to remain in 
Chicago and expand operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">We continually upgrade our instruction with input from our 
business partners to ensure industry relevance and to make 
smart investments in cutting-edge technologies and training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Our commitment to support our program participants that 
ensure their success means that we continually assess 
participants' needs and provide responses in a timely manner. 
Recently, Greater West Town has expanded its focus on 
networking with other community-based agencies to help provide 
for fundamental needs such as child care, housing, 
transportation, and food security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Greater West Town's services are in more demand than ever, 
but resources to support our work are shrinking.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF TAMARA SLATER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GOODWILLINDUSTRIES OF GREATER NEBRASKA</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="TAMARA SLATER">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. SLATER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Good morning. Thank you for the invitation to
testify on the challenges and opportunities of serving people 
in rural Nebraska impacted by poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. SLATER">My name is Tammy Slater, and I live in Doniphan, Nebraska, 
a town of 850-plus people. I am the chief executive officer of 
Goodwill Industries of Greater Nebraska, located in the third-
largest city of Nebraska, Grand Island, with a population of 
50,000. We are 1 of 157 autonomous Goodwill organizations in 
the United States and 1 of 4 Goodwills serving Nebraska. Last 
year, all Goodwills collectively connected 312,000 people with 
employment in the United States and Canada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Each local Goodwill organization has an assigned territory 
that provides services with our geographic area in response to 
the community's needs. Goodwill Industries of Greater Nebraska 
services promote independence and access to the community, help 
people become successfully employed, support goals of wellness 
and recovery, facilitate group classes to teach responsible 
behavior, and provide safe and affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Our Goodwill mission is to serve Nebraskans experiencing 
intellectual or developmental disabilities, severe and 
persistent mental illness, substance abuse disorder, behavioral 
health challenges, and acquired brain injury. Each year, we 
serve more than 1,600 people in central and western Nebraska 
with an array of services. We help people earn jobs and advance 
their careers with specialized services to meet their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Our service territory, as Chairman Smith referenced, 
includes 55 counties and is about 54,000 square miles. Of the 
counties we serve, 30 percent have a population of 3,000 or 
fewer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. SLATER">The challenges of poverty, as we all know, from lack of 
stable housing, adequate nutrition, effective health care, 
reliable transportation, quality child care, appropriate 
education, and job training, are common to both rural and urban 
areas. How we respond to these challenges may be different 
because we do have sparse population, limited local resources, 
and scarce employment opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Education and job opportunities are scarce, as I said, for 
people in rural Nebraska, which is a major roadblock to lifting 
people out of poverty. In 2015, rural employment was still 
below pre-recession rates, and earnings are generally lower in 
rural areas than those in urban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Many of the individuals that we serve require comprehensive 
services. So partnerships with State and local agencies are 
important to address the complex needs of people living in 
rural Nebraska. Community partnerships, such as our public 
schools, United Ways, areas churches, local Salvation Army 
posts, help us to build a network in order to help. Government 
partners in health and human services, like corrections, voc 
rehab, and Social Security, among others, help people living in 
rural communities get and keep their life on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Though partnerships are crucial to success, it is tougher 
in rural areas because there are fewer community organizations, 
and we struggle to continue services due to the long distance 
between communities, which are expensive to maintain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. SLATER">We at Goodwill are grateful for our social enterprise that 
create jobs and help fund services. Our team members work to 
understand our neighbors in the communities we serve and how we 
equip them to overcome poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. SLATER">One of those neighbors is Peter. When Peter was referred 
from Nebraska Vocational Rehab to Goodwill, which that is where 
we get our referrals, he was unemployed, he was diagnosed with 
bipolar disorder, adjustment disorder with anxiety and 
depression, a narcissistic personality disorder, and receiving 
Social Security. Peter was also on probation for a felony, and 
his employment retention was beyond poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Peter was able to access an array of services from our 
Goodwill, including comprehensive benefits planning, behavioral 
health day services, and our behavioral health employment 
program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Together with Peter, the team working to support him, 
including Goodwill staff, the local probation, his counselor at 
Nebraska VR, and his family members, he has had a great result. 
He has been employed for over 1 year, continues to work with 
our behavioral health and benefits planning. Peter is just one 
example of the complexity of those we serve every day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Ms. Slater ">I thank you for this opportunity to share our experience. 
We appreciate the subcommittee's interest in hearing from the 
field and are very happy to serve as a resource. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Slater ">[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Slater ">Chairman SMITH OF NEBRASKA. Thank you, Ms. Slater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Slater ">Thank you very much to all of our witnesses, again, for 
sharing your expertise and this perspective that I hope we can 
all share. And we are going to go down the line here with the 
question-and-answer and just describe our districts a little 
bit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Slater ">Obviously, I mentioned earlier that, you know, we have 
rural parts of America and remote parts. And, obviously, if 
someone has a commute in the city for various reasons, there 
can be significant commutes in rural and remote America as 
well. Sometimes I describe parts of my district in terms of the 
distance from a Walmart, maybe even a McDonald's, and it runs 
in the hours. And so it can be very different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Slater ">And yet, when it boils down to it, many of the needs are 
similar to even that of the inner city. And, of course, 
sometimes the commute times of city life would have something 
that no one in rural America would want to tolerate. But I 
think that hopefully we will see programs, though, with 
flexibility and the intent to help people in a very authentic 
way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Slater ">But, Ms. Slater, again, thanks for being here and certainly 
describing the district and your work and sharing some of the 
stories that you did and certainly some of the clients you 
serve. And it can be obviously challenging to address poverty 
and the economic needs of the many communities across our 
district because of distances even from organizations like 
yours, even though you are pretty well spread out across the 
district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Slater ">Although our unemployment rate is lower and high school 
graduation is higher than in many States, I know there are 
still many people struggling to find work and make ends meet. I 
especially appreciate the story you tell about Peter in your 
testimony and how, by coordinating services and helping him set 
goals, he has been able to overcome some of the difficulties he 
has faced and now has been employed for over a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Slater ">At the Federal level, we are thinking about ways to provide 
more flexibility, coupled with strong accountability, to make 
sure that your organization and those like it can customize 
services and benefits so you can help more people like Peter 
succeed in the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Slater ">    As we think about our efforts, what should we make sure you 
are able to do or do more of for you to be successful as an 
organization? What are some of the key factors in what you do 
which helped Peter be successful, find a job, and stay

    <speaker>Ms. SLATER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Chairman Smith, when I think about that
question, the most important thing is it is not just one 
service. When I talked about the variety of services that we 
offer at Goodwill, getting a job, yes, is the main focus 
because we all know that a job gives us purpose in life, but it 
is the whole package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Again, someone has to, first of all, be able to understand 
and know what their barriers are and how can we help them. If I 
think about Peter, with a mental illness, again, being able to 
have people understand that illness and how do they now learn 
to cope with that disease, whatever that may be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Then, once they understand that, what also is important is 
giving them structure to their life. Because, again, now that 
they have this barrier or a mental illness to deal with, the 
structure of how to cope with that, how important medication 
is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. SLATER">But then, also, how do we then teach them possibly new 
skills or for them to understand what their skill set or 
abilities are, and how do we help them understand that to then 
match them with a proper job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Then the other challenge becomes partnering with employers, 
because we all know, you hear it across the United States every 
day, it is tough to find employees. But, again, if we are then 
bringing someone forward as a potential employee, what is their 
openness to work with someone that may have some special needs 
or a mental illness or other barriers that make it possibly 
more difficult for them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. SLATER">It has to be collaboration. I hope that was strong in my 
message. It is not just one of any of us. It is all of us 
coming together and making sure we understand what each of us 
bring to the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. SLATER">So, Chairman Smith, the first answer would be flexibility 
to be able to reach out to the proper services that will meet 
that individual's needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Chairman SMITH OF NEBRASKA. Okay. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. SLATER">    Ms. Kneebone, would you be able to reflect on this at all, 
given your insight?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. KNEEBONE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">Just to echo what Ms. Slater said, with the
flexibility being key, especially as you see some of the more 
effective models being ones that are able to bring multiple 
programs together, multiple partners to the table. That also 
often brings with it a big administrative burden, a lot of red 
tape, that puts a strain on the providers and takes resources 
from the actual mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">So I think the ability to allow for more experimentation 
and figure out how, with accountability, we can allow for more 
flexible strategies that work over different kinds of 
communities, that would be key.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">Chairman SMITH OF NEBRASKA. All right, and very well. Thank 
you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">    I now recognize our distinguished ranking member, Mr. 
Davis, for questions he might have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DAVIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. DAVIS">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. DAVIS">And I thank all of you who have come to share with us this 
morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. DAVIS">Each one of you talked about a lack of local resources for 
addressing some of the key challenges of poverty--skill-
building, supports like child care, health care, 
transportation, and housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. DAVIS">Could targeted Federal investment make a real difference in 
the kind of communities you have studied?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. DAVIS">    Perhaps, Ms. Slater, I will start with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. SLATER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. SLATER"> Yes, I believe so, because, again, the Federal
support directs how it trickles down to the State and the 
region. So, again, it is back to the flexibility and really 
acknowledging the lack of services in some of the areas.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DAVIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. DAVIS"> Mr. Leavy.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Danny, I think, for us, we have been through a
lot of iterations of different job training programs. We even 
been around since CETA, practically, you know--Job Training 
Partnership Act, Welfare to Work Act, the American Recovery 
Act. But the point is that most of these programs don't really 
allow you to do the intensive kind of training we actually do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">We may have to cobble together resources from a whole bunch 
of places to get enough money to get the basic skills 
remediation, to get the work maturity training and this very 
expensive occupational skills training, where our shop--you 
have been there. I mean, this is an expensive operation, but it 
gets people real skills, and people can really get quality jobs 
and get a foothold on the career ladder. It is an investment 
that is not being made and needs to be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">So, again, in the old days, the Job Training Partnership 
Act used to train tons of African American men in Chicago for 
jobs in the city. That was almost all wiped out when we went to 
a voucher-based system with WIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">    So, again, we need to put some of the money in job training 
that we used to have during CETA days, and we used to make a 
real, real commitment to skills training and lifting people out 
of poverty. It can be done. I mean, we are a model. It can be 
done, and Linda and I do it. But we need much, much, much more 
consistent resource and commitment to comprehensive training 
and getting industry--I am talking too much. Okay, I will be 
quiet.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DAVIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. DAVIS"> Mr. Partridge.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. PARTRIDGE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">I mean, I think the answer is yes, and I think they 
described it well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">One of the things, though, I want to point out is, 
especially in rural communities but even in urban communities, 
there are these scattered programs and, you know, duplicate 
services and all sorts of issues. And so that was one of the 
reasons why in my testimony I discussed expanding regional, 
State, Federal development organizations, like the Appalachian 
Regional Commission. They exist on paper like in Ms. Sewell's 
district, but it doesn't have any--I don't think there are any 
resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">And so what they would do is, they have--like, the 
Appalachian Regional Commission only has a $100 million to $150 
million budget; however, they are fantastic at being the broker 
who leads the efforts that brings everything to the table to 
help with the collaboration that the previous two spoke about 
that is needed for this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">    So I think that would be one of the ways that a relatively 
small amount of money could have a lot of payoff.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DAVIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. DAVIS"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Kneebone</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Ms. Kneebone">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. KNEEBONE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">I think that point really speaks to
addressing the capacity issue, because targeted Federal 
investment absolutely could make a big difference in these 
places, especially if it embraces these more wholistic, 
crosscutting strategies that recognize the complexities that 
are facing poor people in poor communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">But if we want that funding to be able to reach into some 
of these communities we are talking about, in places where 
poverty has grown rapidly more recently, we have to overcome 
that capacity gap. And having these quarterback-type 
institutions that can play that role and more effectively 
marshal all those resources is a critical step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">    So any sort of funding, I think, should explicitly 
recognize and target resources to that type of backbone 
capacity-building and that sort of entity.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. DAVIS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. DAVIS">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. DAVIS">    And quickly, Mr. Leavy, I have always been intrigued by 
your ability to work directly with local employers, where you 
know that you are training people for what they need. How did 
you accomplish that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Without going into a lot of history, I mean, we
understood that race was a big variable. On the old west side 
of Chicago, where my dad worked--and he worked at a 
manufacturing company and he lived in the neighborhood, took 
the bus, blah, blah,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">blah. When that neighborhood changed to African American, 
those local companies had extreme difficulty in absorbing and 
training the local workforce, and we can see it 20 years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">So we went to partner with the Industrial Council of 
Nearwest Chicago, and these are our local employers. Let's work 
together, let's create a program that is going to open the 
doors for our community residents, brown and black, and is 
going to get you the workers you need. And we actually sat down 
and planned the bloody thing with our neighborhood small 
businesses in woodworking and shipping and receiving with the 
help of the Industrial Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">The key to that was the employers have some sense of 
ownership and involvement. And employers got to meet our 
community people during training. They got to see their 
dedication. They got to see the quality of our people. And 
racial stereotypes were overcome, attitudes for ex-offenders 
were overcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">And they were setting the standards for training, so they 
owned it. It is way more than just, you know, I have a company 
that I am going to take a job order from and steal. No. These 
guys are involved and they own the program design and they 
owned its success. And you probably heard from them. We got our 
funding cut, and these employers, they went to the mat for us. 
So they own this thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">And they are 99 percent white small-business owners from 
the industrial corridor. And it is great when our participants 
go on a field trip, a tour to a local company; they go in and 
look at whatever the company is, and they see, oh, there is my 
neighbor working. So they get the confidence that these guys 
are giving our people, black people, a fair shake and some 
opportunity. And, conversely, the small-business owner sees the 
hard work, the diligence of our trainees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">And, of course, the credibility of our staff and the 
training institution itself kind of brings the community and 
business together. These guys have been doing this for 25 
years, and----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Chairman SMITH OF NEBRASKA. Great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Mr. LEAVY [continuing]. They have got quite a reputation in 
the employer community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Chairman SMITH OF NEBRASKA. Very good. Thank you. Thank you 
for your answers there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Now we will go to Mr. Smith of Missouri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Mr. SMITH OF MISSOURI. Thank you, Chairman Smith. It is an 
honor to serve on your committee. And I like the ring of 
``Chairman Smith,'' by the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">I want to thank the panel for being here today. In fact, 
these issues are extremely important. I have spoken with the 
chairman and the members of this committee of my personal 
background and interest in poverty. I grew up in a very 
working-class family. And I represent an area in southeast, 
south-central Missouri which is part of the Mississippi Delta, 
and we have some very interesting dynamics of our own that we 
deal with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">It is the largest congressional district in the State of 
Missouri, just under 30 counties. It is roughly 20,000 square 
miles, so it is very rural. Our largest populated community is 
a town of 38,000 people, Cape Girardeau, Missouri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">And I want to give you some interesting statistics about 
our congressional district. According to the Economic 
Innovation Group, I represent the 14th most economically 
distressed congressional district in the country, out of 436--
14 out of 436, which is absolutely not good. It is also one of 
the most conservative congressional districts in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">The Economic Innovation Group report on distressed 
communities estimates that 49 percent of adults in my district 
are not in the labor force, and the poverty rate is 20 percent. 
These numbers are not much different than the city of St. 
Louis. In St. Louis, 42 percent of adults are not in the labor 
force, and the poverty rate stands around 22 percent. So we 
have more people out of the workforce in our district than the 
city of St. Louis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">And that is much different, though--Ms. Kneebone, according 
to your testimony, I think these are interesting facts for the 
State of Missouri. The picture is really different in the 
suburbs of St. Louis. Just 6 miles from the city of St. Louis, 
it is 36 percent adults who aren't working, and the poverty 
rate is only 6 percent. The city of St. Louis, the poverty rate 
is 22 percent. In my rural congressional district, it is 20 
percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">All that, in my opinion, says that rural southeast and 
south-central Missouri experiences poverty in similar numbers 
to the city of St. Louis, and both are far worse than the 
suburbs of St. Louis, which the poverty rate is 6 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">We know that employment is the single largest determining 
indicator of poverty, but we continued to see factories close 
for the last several years. In many cases, we see our good-
paying factory jobs go overseas because of economic hardships 
and burdensome regulations. These factories can't keep their 
doors open, and that means that we are losing good jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">We had one employer in Butler County, Missouri, in my first 
year in office that cited that the reason that they were 
shutting down their doors and eliminating roughly 500 jobs was 
because of unnecessary and burdensome regulations that they 
couldn't comply with and was moving to Mexico. This is a real 
problem and something that has to be changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">When nearly half of adults in my district aren't working 
and are out of the labor force entirely, our communities are 
deeply in trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">    Mr. Partridge, with many rural areas declining in 
population, who is staying behind? Are these areas becoming 
wealthier as those who remain have good jobs and choose to 
stay, or are they becoming poorer as those without means are 
unable to leave?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. PARTRIDGE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Thank you, Mr. Smith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">I think the answer to that question is it depends. Because 
if we are talking about a rural district--very, very, very 
rural districts where people left, what is left behind is often 
relatively wealthy farmers that are very big. So, in that 
sense--then you have other districts where you have brain 
drain, where the talented people leave, and that leaves behind 
a workforce that is less educated and it is just going to be 
less dynamic. There is going to be less business formation and 
so forth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">So it really depends on the setting. There is just a lot of 
diversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Mr. SMITH OF MISSOURI. So just a lot of barometers and 
issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">    You have been doing a lot to improve the economies of rural 
areas. Could you give us some examples of what maybe you have 
done for people in their 30s and 40s to help grow the economy 
in rural areas?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. PARTRIDGE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Well, what I have done is I have tried to
point out that when people--especially in the last 15 years, 
there has been a lot of emphasis on attracting young people 
with really cool downtowns and so forth, and rural communities 
can't compete on that. They are just not going to do very well 
on that basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">However, they can compete on being family-friendly and 
having a really nice environment and lifestyle for certain 
people. So, in that sense, people in their 30s and 40s are no 
longer looking for cool bars; they are looking for a place to 
send their kids and be safe. That is where rural communities 
can thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Mr. SMITH OF MISSOURI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Chairman SMITH OF NEBRASKA. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">    And next we have--yes, Ms. Sewell. Sorry. Go ahead.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. SEWELL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">And thank you, panelists. This is the first subcommittee 
hearing as a new member of Ways and Means that I get to 
participate in. And I have to tell you that I am very excited, 
Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Davis, about the opportunity 
to be on this subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">My district is the Seventh Congressional District of 
Alabama. I grew up in this district. It is a district that 
includes the city of Birmingham, which is the largest city in 
the State of Alabama, but it also includes Selma, Alabama, 
which is my hometown, and many rural communities around Selma. 
The median income for a family of four in my district is 
$34,000, and 22 percent of the families in my district live in 
poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">It is affectionately called the Black Belt of Alabama 
because of the very rich soil. That used to be very agrarian 
and agricultural. It is where a lot of the Cotton Belt of 
Alabama, back in the day, used to exist. Now it is filled with 
a lot of rural communities that are struggling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">I often say that what we lack in the Seventh Congressional 
District in terms of economic prosperity we more than make up 
for in heart, in fight, in spirit. What we need are better 
opportunities, more resources, a hand up, not a handout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">Having said that, I was very intrigued by what you were 
talking about, Mr. Partridge, in terms of regional 
collaboration. The Appalachian Regional Commission, which you 
cited, has done some great work across the 13 States that it 
encompasses, with relatively limited resources when you think 
about the fact that they have to deal with 13 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">In fact, my district doesn't get a lot of resources from 
the ARC. Many of the collaborative regional resources that we 
receive come from the Delta Regional Authority, which has a 
very limited budget. It is one-tenth of what ARC is. Yet it is 
literally the lifeline for so many of the communities I 
represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">    Can you talk a little bit about the regional collaboration 
and what we can do as lawmakers that are not in the position of 
providing appropriating dollars but, rather, authorization of 
different social net programs that can be effective in reaching 
communities like so many of us represent?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. PARTRIDGE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Thank you, Ms. Sewell. I think you really
described a lot of the issues well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">So when you get down into central southern rural Alabama, 
you have a lot of counties. They lack resources. There are many 
disparate Federal--you know, Economic Development 
Administration, USDA Rural Development, Department of Labor 
workforce training, and so on--all these disparate groups. And 
these counties just lack things like even an economic 
development coordinator or one without a lot of training who 
knows how to write these very complex grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">And so that is one of the key things that ARC has done, is 
it is a Federal-State, so it is flexible, it isn't one-size-
fits-all, but they are really kind of a leader. And they have, 
like, how to do grant-writing, to bringing all these disparate 
counties together to work collaboratively, because if you get 
jobs in one county, people commute and take them, it helps the 
whole region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">    So, in that sense, what I view these organizations as doing 
is they are the broker. They are the ones who can bring 
everybody to the table with relatively modest resources.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. SEWELL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">What do you suggest we would do on the
authorization side when it comes to workforce development?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">I would like to get you, Mr. Leavy, involved as well. You 
know, one of my passions is workforce development, because here 
is what I know for a fact. So many of the folks that I 
represent want better opportunities. They want jobs. The 
problem is finding those jobs. In rural America, a lot of those 
manufacturing opportunities have really dried up. And so, when 
you finally do get an opportunity, people haven't worked in 
those manufacturing jobs for generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">My biggest example is Wilcox County, which is the poorest 
county in the State of Alabama. It is in my district. And we 
got--I am the only Democrat in Alabama, but I have very good 
working relationships with my Republican colleagues. And we 
were able to convince the Governor to give us a $150 million 
manufacturing opportunity in the poorest part of my district. 
It is a copper manufacturing facility. Here is the problem: We 
are now busing in people from other communities, Tuscaloosa, to 
come and take these jobs, because we have had generations of 
people who haven't had an opportunity to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">    Now, given this great opportunity, how do we bring folks up 
to speed when it comes to workforce development?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Okay. I will take a shot at that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">What happens is, when people are out of the workforce for a 
long time, they don't trust the employers, they don't trust the 
system, they are kind of hanging back, they are not willing to 
make the effort, because they are afraid to fail. So you have 
to get them started in baby steps, and you have to have 
institutions that can engage them credibly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">And if they are engaged and if they believe in the training 
institutions and they start putting forth the effort, then you 
can see these folks can learn just like anybody else can learn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Okay. So it is a--we call it work ethics, okay? And we 
train for it on the shop floor every day. I mean, Linda's shop 
is a workplace, and you have to come on time, and you have to 
respect your fellow workers, and you have to follow the boss's 
instruction. So you get work ethics training every day on the 
job. And that is an essential part of getting people to 
understand that this can work for them, okay, and getting used 
to the workplace disciplines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">    So you have the workplace disciplines; you have basic 
skills remediation. And then people say, oh, hey, if you pass 
this, if you do that, you are going to get to run that machine, 
you are going to drive that forklift. People can see progress, 
okay? And these folks can learn it. They need to get motivated 
and believe it is possible for them.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. SEWELL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">Chairman Smith, thank you so much for allowing
him to answer that question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">I think it just goes to the need that we can try to explore 
in this committee, workforce development strategies that will 
work across the board for people dealing with poverty issues in 
suburbia, in urban, and in rural.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Ms. SEWELL">    Thank you, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman SMITH</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Chairman SMITH">Right. That is absolutely--and, certainly,
for the answers to the questions, that is very relevant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Chairman SMITH">Mrs. Walorski?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Chairman SMITH">Mrs. WALORSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, again, thank 
you for holding this important hearing. I am absolutely 
passionate about this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Chairman SMITH">And I am so glad each of you are here. My district is 
northern Indiana, and so we are 2 hours from Chicago and have, 
in the past, on some other committees I have been on, looked at 
best practices and places and things that are happening in 
Chicago that really are, I think, a standard right now of where 
we are looking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Chairman SMITH">I want to give a shout-out to our Goodwill in Indiana, the 
Goodwill Industries, and what they have done in our district, 
our State, as they have been able to, you know, hone in on this 
issue of collaboration, which I want to come back to, Ms. 
Slater, in a second and talk about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Chairman SMITH">I think it is incredible that all of your research, all of 
your findings, and other experts that we have had speak to 
Congress over the last couple of years--it is so apparent to me 
that all the work that we are doing--when we look at 
traditional approaches from government, which has been increase 
funding, increase funding, increase funding, and when you start 
looking at the numbers of people in poverty, where they are 
coming from, where they are moving from, it just becomes so 
important, in my mind, to do the kinds of things you are 
talking about, which is connecting people to this equation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Chairman SMITH">It still takes people on the front lines to coordinate. It 
takes people on the front lines to be able to honor human 
dignity and to make sure that we are looking at all the seeds 
of the problem and we are actually doing something to make sure 
that there is an economic ladder out of poverty in this 
country, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Chairman SMITH">And I am so convinced that the solutions to our very 
problems are right here within the kinds of research that you 
have all done and the kind of things that you have moved along, 
that we are moving the dignity of people along as well, that, 
you know, we are equipping a nation. We are doing it, using 
each other in collaboration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Chairman SMITH">And I think, Ms. Slater, to your point, my district is very 
much a case study like what you are talking about in Nebraska. 
I am 2 hours from Chicago. We are urban; we are rural. We have 
all the same kind of makeup that, you know, a lot of these 
small rural areas are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Chairman SMITH">I am terrified that if we don't come together and fix this 
in a bipartisan way that rural America will not recover and 
that we are going to be groping for bigger issues later if we 
don't come together and solve this now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Chairman SMITH">But I am so convinced about this issue of collaboration. 
And I am working on a bill right now as we approach TANF.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Chairman SMITH">    Can you just talk about some of the best practices that you 
have used in your community to collaborate on the front line 
and why that is going to be important as we look at, you know, 
tangible assistance to needy families in the real quick future 
here?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. SLATER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Sure. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Truly, the thing that comes to mind that you just 
summarized is it is about people. It is about people working 
together that are there to actually serve the people we are 
seeing every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. SLATER">And so, truly, it becomes--and I think it is one of the 
advantages, maybe, of the rural community, is we know each 
other. It is asking for help. It is actually acknowledging what 
your core is and what cores come from other agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Ms. SLATER">The other thing that I think is a plus in the rural 
community, but not unique, is the fact that if there is an 
individual with a barrier in a small community, everybody in 
town knows that. They talk about it. They know Tammy at 
Goodwill, and they will call and see if we can be of 
assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. SLATER">But it is really about the whole relationship and trying 
not to make it the competition that sometimes it becomes but 
what are we really good at. And that is one of our best 
practices, is we have a lot of diverse programs, but at the end 
of the day, what are we the best at. So if something else comes 
along, we have learned to say ``no'' and to extend a hand and 
offer something that we may know about to someone else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. SLATER">    Mrs. WALORSKI. That is incredible.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. SLATER</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Because you cannot be good at everything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. SLATER">Mrs. WALORSKI. Absolutely. And that is a great point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Ms. SLATER">I just have a question for all of you in this last minute 
here. One of the things in my community that is a plus, both on 
the rural and the urban side, is the benevolence of my 
community and the private dollars in regional coordination that 
are beginning to flow into our own community from our own 
people--private dollars, community foundations that are really 
understanding this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Ms. SLATER">    I guess, Mr. Partridge, let me just address that to you; it 
is your research. Do you see that emerging now in this country, 
where we are looking at partnerships, even financially, so it 
is not just a one look at a government but we are looking at 
resources inside our communities as well?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. PARTRIDGE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">I think you exactly described it right, in
the sense that, you know, a lot of this has been promoted--you 
know, attempts for collaboration have been promoted by just 
things haven't been working. And a lot of it is that problems 
are a lot bigger than what one community can handle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">However, at the community level, as you suggested, I mean, 
the best way is to--every community has great resources. They 
have entrepreneurship that is untapped. They have human 
resources that is untapped. And as I noted in my testimony, you 
know, just the multiplier effects of new jobs created, 
spillovers from small-business creation and local 
entrepreneurship are just rather remarkable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">And so, in that sense, building from within is, I think, 
the best strategy, and the kind of collaboration you are 
talking about is the way to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Mrs. WALORSKI. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence. Chairman 
SMITH. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">    And next we have Mr. Reichert.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. REICHERT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">Thank you all for the hard work that you do. And it sort of 
seems removed just a little bit, as we are in this formal 
setting, from the reality of the topic that we are discussing, 
doesn't it? I always sort of get overwhelmed by that thought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">But I was thinking back to one of the first hearings that I 
had when I was chairman and working with Mr. Davis as the 
ranking member, and I shared my story. There are a lot of 
stories here, and you have a lot of stories, a lot of stories 
out there in the audience today, too, listening. And as I 
shared my story, after the hearing Mr. Davis said to me, ``You 
know, you and I could have grown up in the same neighborhood.'' 
And sometimes we forget that we all come from different places, 
we all come from areas in our life where we struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">And Sandra Collins was one of those people from the 
Goodwill Industries organization in the Seattle area. She 
testified not too long ago when I was the chairman of this 
subcommittee. What a success story for Sandra. Sandra was 
homeless. She had two teenage daughters and was addicted to 
meth. She had a criminal background. She had no high school 
diploma, did not have a driver's license when she first 
connected with the Goodwill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">But, as she was giving her testimony, she got news that she 
was just about to be promoted to supervisor. So Sandra is still 
working at the Goodwill in the Seattle area and is now the 
manager. So we are proud of her and proud of the work that 
Goodwill Industries does all across the country, and we need 
every one of your efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">So Ms. Sewell was concerned about people coming in to 
populated areas and taking jobs, and I am concerned about some 
of the rural areas having the opportunity to come into those 
areas and get jobs. But we have to balance that, I know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">    And I wanted to ask Mr. Partridge, are there any programs 
that--you know, because sometimes people have to make those 
decisions to relocate to find a job. What are we looking at as 
far as programs to help people relocate, not necessarily to 
take all the jobs but to participate in the workforce?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. PARTRIDGE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Well, thank you for the question, Mr.
Reichert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">I think you really hit upon--one really important issue is 
that, in the past, the key way that Americans did economic 
opportunity, reached it, was by migration. We were probably the 
most mobile society in the world for generations. And in the 
last generation, that has really changed. Young Americans are 
much less mobile than before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">So one of the ways that poverty can be reduced is taking 
people from places that there are a lack of opportunities and 
moving them to places where there are opportunities. And one of 
the problems is they are relatively poor, they lack resources 
for that. They don't have a network, you know, to find a job. 
Their skills might have been okay for where they are at, but 
they are not necessarily good in an urban environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">    So I would encourage efforts to, at least on a pilot basis, 
to try to look at helping migration of workers to where there 
are more opportunities. However, it is just a little bit more 
complex than saying, ``Here is some money, go move,'' because 
of these other issues about the lack of job networks and the 
lack of training for the kind of jobs that would exist in urban 
areas.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. REICHERT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">Great. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">Mr. Leavy, I wanted to touch on one of your comments as you 
rolled off the statics about unemployment between Black men, 
Hispanics, and Caucasians. And I was reading your statement, 
and you used the word ``controversial'' in your comments, but 
it is not used in your statement. And I don't see anything 
controversial about it. I just wanted to point that out. 
Because people are people, in my opinion, and we are here to 
help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">So let me just further state very quickly that I think it 
is sad that the 50-percent dropout rate--I mean, that is just 
an unacceptable number, and I think that is one of the things 
we have to address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. REICHERT">    I am an old cop, 33 years on the streets in King County. I 
worked with people on the street in drug addiction, alcohol, 
homeless, all the time. One of the things we need to do--and I 
am very high on prevention. What do we need to do to get these 
young people to graduate so they don't start already behind the 
curve?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. LEAVY"> Well, we have actually--we started an
alternative high school for dropouts in Chicago because the 
dropout rates were so severe----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. REICHERT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"> But it is still 50 percent. We need to do a
lot more.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">They have been--it has been--it has been--I use
the term, schools had and are still reporting, neighborhood 
schools had and are still reporting the dropout rate in Chicago 
has improved a little bit. Okay? I will give you that. And 
there has been a lot of intervention on dropouts and special 
programs for dropouts, some of which reasonably work in the 
city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">So we are a lot better on the dropout front than we were 10 
years ago. And we did a lot of research on that and got some 
bills passed with Senator del Valle at the State level to deal 
with the re-enrollment of dropouts. So there is a commission in 
Illinois for the re-enrollment of dropouts, and we got the 
issue in the public attention, and so we have made some serious 
progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">    There are still tons of at-risk kids. And we run an 
alternative school in the heart of the west side, and our kids 
are pretty alienated sometimes and pretty tough. And putting 
together, again, the programs that can engage them and 
discipline them and challenge them is a hell of a lot----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. REICHERT</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. REICHERT"> I would like to engage further with him at a
later time, Mr. Chairman. My time has expired. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman SMITH</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Chairman SMITH"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Chu</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Ms. Chu">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. CHU</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Ms. CHU">Thank you, Chairman Smith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Ms. CHU">I represent a very urban/suburban district in Los Angeles 
County, which has 10 million people. And, Mr. Leavy, the work 
that you do is in an area that is very similar to this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Ms. CHU">In L.A. County, we have a very, very large homeless 
population. In fact, the most recent count revealed that there 
are approximately 43,000 homeless individuals living in 
shelters or in the streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Ms. CHU">    Now, you have done a lot of work with similar urban/
suburban populations in Chicago. How could Federal antipoverty 
programs best assist homeless populations in places like L.A. 
County and Chicago?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">I am trying to get Linda to talk. She is the
expert in--she provides all the intensive support services to 
the very high-need folks. And we have, what did we say, 22 
percent homeless and near-homeless in the training program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">    So tell them a little bit about the transitional work and 
how it helps the homeless.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. THOMAS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Ms. THOMAS">So we, through our city dollars, have come
across what we call transitional jobs training funding, where 
we can work with our clients to provide additional services. We 
try to help our customers become self-sufficient and to be able 
to attend training without worry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Ms. THOMAS">    And so we are able to create jobs within the program and 
give them a weekly stipend to support them with their needs. We 
are able to address their ability to secure housing and their 
ability to get to training and their ability to have clothing 
and doctors appointments so that they will have a positive 
outcome through our transitional jobs training funding.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. CHU</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Ms. CHU"> So, for this homeless population, what elements of
what you have talked about are the most important? For 
instance, how important is accessibility to quality housing?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. THOMAS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Ms. THOMAS">For the homeless population, if I don't have
secure housing, I will not do well in the job. Before I can 
take on employment, I have to make sure I have secure housing, 
I have to make sure that I have transportation to get to that 
job every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Ms. THOMAS">So, when they are in the training program, we are going to 
immediately on day one start to look at those resources that 
are out there to make sure this person will have secure 
housing. Because we have a lot of people, they are homeless 
with a roof, so they are going to a cousin's house today, they 
are staying with a friend tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Ms. THOMAS">And so we are going to work with an agency that is going to 
help them move into housing where it is secure, so when I start 
my new job, I can go to work not worrying about where am I 
going to live tomorrow or will I get back to the shelter in 
time to get a bed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Ms. THOMAS">    So those are the ways that we work strongly to help out 
with the homelessness, for housing.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. CHU</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Ms. CHU">Yeah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Ms. CHU">And, in fact, to follow up, in L.A. County, we have higher-
income neighborhoods located right next to low-income and poor 
neighborhoods. And, in fact, poverty is found in pockets and 
separated, oftentimes, just simply by a neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Ms. CHU">    So how did we get into this situation, and how can we 
reduce this inequality between the neighborhoods that are 
located right next to each other?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Wow. You know, Danny knows, you know, you have
the west side, Austin, and then you have Oak Park, and you have 
a serious dividing line. Oak Park is a pretty liberal, 
progressive place. They have PADS programs, and they try to 
keep themselves accessible to the low-income folks in the city. 
And, you know, I am not sure how you integrate across those 
barriers. It is a voluntary thing in Oak Park. I live in Oak 
Park, and they are just very progressive folks out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">In terms of your question, you know, how do you create 
cooperation across community boundaries, neighborhood 
boundaries, I mean, Chicago is extremely racially segregated. 
And you have neighborhoods on the south and west side that, you 
know, folks on the north side will not go in. And you have 
pockets of wealth and affluence on the north side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">And you need community development--most of our development 
resources traditionally are--I talk about in my longer thing. 
You talk about triage. You are putting resources for those most 
likely to succeed. You are not making the investments in the 
high-risk areas, in the high-poverty areas where you have 
multigenerational poverty. I mean, everybody wants to pick a 
winner, and everybody is afraid to waste money on what might be 
a loser.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">And, again, this is an attitude that, you know, we see in 
job training, we see in education, we see across the board--we 
see in housing and urban development sometimes. So this triage 
attitude is something that we really have to get our head 
around and fight against.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">What is happening in our training program--because the 
labor markets are improving and some people are moving ahead 
and some people are getting jobs, but those left behind are 
really desperate, are really sinking. Okay? That is the 
problem. We are separating more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">    You talk about income inequality. We talk about it, you 
know, on the cosmic scale when Bill Gates and those guys have 
all the money, but it also happens in our communities. We are 
segregating the rich and the poor even more, and we need to 
figure out how to fix that. Clearly, jobs are part of that, and 
people investing in jobs for low-income people is clearly a 
part of that solution. But, again, I think there are more 
economic development issues involved here than I am prepared to 
mouth off about right now.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. CHU</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Ms. CHU"> Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman SMITH</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Chairman SMITH"> Right. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rice</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Rice">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. RICE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. RICE">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. RICE">Interesting hearing. It seems to me that the way you deal 
with poverty is you have to do what you can to make sure people 
have opportunity on the one hand, and then on the other hand 
you have to do what you can to make sure they take advantage of 
that opportunity. And it seems like, mostly, today, we are 
talking about the second part of that equation, trying to get 
people to take advantage of opportunities that they have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. RICE">My district, I got seven counties in South Carolina. I have 
Myrtle Beach, a big popular tourist destination, and employment 
rates are pretty low there. But if you go inland, I have 3 of 
the top 10 poorest counties in the State. They were very 
agrarian and textiles, tobacco and textiles. So you can guess 
what has happened to them in the last 40 years, right? 
Agriculture doesn't employ as many people, and certainly not 
tobacco. Tobacco is a fraction of what it used to be. And 
textiles, those jobs are all gone. There are a lot of empty 
factories in Marion County, South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. RICE">So, on the one hand, you know, the first part of the 
equation, trying to do what you can to make sure people have 
opportunity--and we haven't talked much about that today. But 
things like tax reform, regulatory reform that Jason Smith was 
talking about earlier is so important and a lot of the reasons 
why a lot of these companies that used to be in Marion County 
have left. And I put that on Washington, D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. RICE">    And that is why I am so very happy that this committee is 
now working on tax reform and the House is working on 
regulatory reform, because I think the first part of that 
equation--I mean, you can train people all you want to, but if 
there are no jobs available when they get out, it doesn't help 
very much, does it, Mr. Leavy? So, I mean, you have to get 
them----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. LEAVY"> Believe it or not, a trained workforce can be an
incentive for a company to come into an area----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. RICE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. RICE">That is true. That is another part of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. RICE">You know, there is a program in the Florence-Darlington 
Technical College; they have a program for computerized digital 
machining. And they can take 80 kids a year, and it is a 2-year 
program. And they have two problems: One, they can't get 50 
kids a year to sign up for it; and, two, if they do get them to 
sign up for it, most of them don't finish. They get through 1 
year. Well, the reason they don't finish is because the 
companies are so hungry for these kids that they hire them 
before they finish their program. So, in other words, we have 
this opportunity, but we can't get people to take advantage of 
the opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. RICE">And I believe most people would rather work than be on 
government programs. I think if you rely on the government to 
provide for your livelihood, you will always live in poverty. I 
think the government is incapable of providing for you. But we 
have 80 different means-tested government programs, many of 
which are designed to help people to move to work, to move to 
take care of--and they are not working for a large number of 
people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. RICE">There are still significant numbers of people who would 
rather be on government programs than actually go out and take 
that computerized digital machining class and go to work and 
make $60,000 a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. RICE">    How do you fix that, Mr. Leavy?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">Well, I mean, we deal with it every day.
Opportunity plus effort equals success, okay? People have to 
make the effort to take advantage of the opportunities 
presented to them. And do they see and believe and is the 
opportunity real for them? Their perceptions are a lot. And I 
live in this every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. LEAVY">    In Linda's programs, she is able to get and engage and 
discipline her people, and the people are enthusiastic, and she 
has credibility and trust, and the people march through the 
program and they go out in the labor market and they do well. 
Okay. And my high school used to be that way, but it is not so 
much anymore. In our high school, West Side Academy, we are 
having an issue of student engagement and motivation----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. RICE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. RICE"> Okay. I need you to wind down, because I want to
ask somebody else too.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. LEAVY"> What?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. RICE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. RICE"> I want to ask somebody else too, so wind up, if
you can.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LEAVY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. LEAVY"> I will tell you about the West Side Academy some
other day. But, you know, it is a question of credibility and 
trust, and are they perceiving this thing as really working, 
are they believing in it. And if they believe in the leadership 
of that school, that school can discipline them, can draw them 
out, can challenge them. Okay? And they will see it as a 
benefit to them in their lives. They have to have credibility 
with those kids, and you can get them to do what they need to 
do.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. RICE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. RICE"> Mr. Partridge, how do you get them to take
advantage of the opportunity?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. PARTRIDGE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">One of the things that I have always thought about poverty 
is that not only do we have to train workers in places where 
there is a lot of high poverty, there has to be also the 
opportunity so the person has the incentive to go for 2 years 
through a training program so they can get a job. And so, in 
that sense, it is a chicken/egg problem that, you know, there 
have to be jobs to have incentives for people to get the 
training so they could actually get a job. So you are 
absolutely right. It is a chicken/egg issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">    And one of the things that you raised is the general 
macroeconomic environment has not been very favorable for the 
lower half of the income distribution. And, you know, any 
efforts there--manufacturing was an old mainstay for that 
group. And any efforts there to build up that part of the 
economy, I think, would have very large positive effects.

    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. RICE"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

    <speaker>Chairman SMITH</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Chairman SMITH"> Thank you, Mr. Rice.

    <speaker>Mr. Curbelo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Curbelo">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. CURBELO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for holding
this hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">I think you always hear politicians talk about the middle 
class, and, indeed, the middle class is important. It is the 
engine of the American economy. But that is also where most of 
the votes happen to be. In poor communities, there aren't as 
many votes. Yet we are here because you care about this issue, 
Mr. Chairman, we care about this issue, and certainly our 
witnesses do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">So I thank you all for coming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">Ms. Kneebone, I want to talk to you about suburban poverty. 
I represent a largely suburban district. And you discussed the 
migration of poverty from the urban cores out into the suburbs, 
and of course this is a major concern for me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">    I think one of the aggravators or the factors that 
contribute to this phenomenon is the lack of transportation out 
in the suburbs. Most urban cores have fairly sophisticated 
public transportation grids, but as low-income individuals move 
from the urban cores out to the suburbs, does that lack of 
access to public transportation aggravate their circumstances?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. KNEEBONE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">That is a real challenge for suburban
communities across the country, particularly for the poor 
residents, because as both jobs have shifted away from downtown 
and poverty has grown more in suburbs, those aren't often 
happening in the same places. So the distance between where 
jobs are located and where poor people can afford to live has 
grown. And we have seen the number of nearby jobs for poor 
residents fall across the country in urban, suburban, and rural 
communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE">    So the fact that suburbs often don't have public transit 
systems or, when they do, they are not connected suburb to 
suburb where a lot of these job opportunities are growing does 
exacerbate that mismatch. It makes it much harder to connect to 
those employment opportunities that can give them a path out of 
poverty and also makes it more incumbent on them to own a car 
and have to deal with the high costs of maintaining a reliable 
car that would actually be able to get them to where the job 
opportunities are.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. CURBELO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Mr. CURBELO"> So, given that infrastructure investment is a
priority for the new administration and for many of us here in 
Congress, you think there is an opportunity to use some of that 
poverty data to more effectively make these investments.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. KNEEBONE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Ms. KNEEBONE"> Yes, absolutely, both in terms of how we
think about where to make transportation investments, in terms 
of roads versus transit options, you know, where those dollars 
go, how they are deployed, but also in terms of thinking about 
where housing is around those networks, where we can take 
advantage of density around those transit hubs to increase 
access to opportunity both through affordable housing and 
through transportation.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. CURBELO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">Dr. Partridge, I should get you on the record about the 
great theft of 2003, when The Ohio State University robbed the 
University of Miami of a college football championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">By the way, Mr. Chairman, the year before, we defeated 
Nebraska in Pasadena. But let's set that aside, because there 
is very little time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">I do want to ask you about education. And we have built 
this idea in our society that every young person has to go get 
a 4-year degree at a traditional university like The Ohio State 
University, like the University of Miami. And, in many ways, 
our Tax Code supports that idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">    Do you think that the lack of an acknowledgement of the 
diverse paths that there are to success, to getting educated, 
to acquiring the skills needed to obtain a quality job, that 
the lack of recognition is aggravating poverty in a lot of 
communities?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. PARTRIDGE</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">Thank you for the question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">In some cases, yes, that there is a segment of the high 
school population that just is unaware of the opportunities. 
And you are right, many high school curriculums look like a 
pre-college training program, and so there are fewer of those 
opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">I think, you know, besides curriculum reform and providing 
better information to students--that is one of the things that 
the economists found. If you give the students information, 
they will make better decisions. Besides that, one of the areas 
I think is just fantastic in terms of investment and in terms 
of the role they play in communities and broader communities is 
community colleges and technical colleges. They are on the 
ground doing the workforce training, but, even beyond that, 
they have more of a regional footprint that brings people 
together in a collaborative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. PARTRIDGE">    So, in that sense, investment in technical colleges and 
community colleges would have a large payoff for the population 
that we are talking about.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. CURBELO</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">Okay. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. CURBELO">    I will yield back the balance of my time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman SMITH</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Chairman SMITH">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Chairman SMITH">Again, thank you to all of our members here today and 
certainly to our witnesses. Your expertise is valuable, and we 
could probably extend this for a few more hours just in 
discussion. With that being said, though, you will have the 
opportunity to extend your remarks for the record. The record 
will be held open for 2 weeks. And so, if you wish to respond 
in more depth to some of these questions, you will have the 
opportunity to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Chairman SMITH">And, with that, I say thanks again, and the committee 
stands adjourned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Chairman SMITH">[Whereupon, at 11:36 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Chairman SMITH">[Questions for the Record follows:]</paragraph>
