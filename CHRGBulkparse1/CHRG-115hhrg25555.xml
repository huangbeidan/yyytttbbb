your offices earlier this week will be considered en bloc and

support for the Government of Argentina for its investigation 
into the terrorist bombings of the Embassy of Israel in Buenos 
Aires on March 17, 1992; Smith amendment, which was worked out 
between majority and minority staff last night and this 
morning; House Resolution 259, Expressing concern and 
condemnation over the political, economic, social, and 
humanitarian crisis in Venezuela; the Duncan amendment in the 
nature of a substitute to H.R. 259; the Castro amendment--that
