                      Wednesday, November 29, 2017
                     U.S. House of Representatives
                     Committee on Natural Resources
                             Washington, DC
                              ----------                              
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:01 a.m., in 
room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Rob Bishop 
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Bishop, Young, Gohmert, Lamborn, 
McClintock, Pearce, Gosar, Tipton, LaMalfa, Denham, Cook, 
Westerman, Graves, Hice, Radewagen, Johnson; Grijalva, 
Bordallo, Costa, Tsongas, Huffman, Lowenthal, Beyer, Torres, 
Barragan, Soto, and Gomez.
    The Chairman. The Committee on Natural Resources will come 
to order. The Committee today is having an oversight hearing 
entitled, ``Modernizing NEPA for the 21st Century.''
    Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at 
the hearing are limited to the Chair, the Ranking Minority 
Member, and the Vice Chair. This will allow us to hear from the 
witnesses sooner. I am going to ask unanimous consent that all 
other Members' opening statements be made part of the hearing 
record if they are submitted to the Clerk by 5:00 p.m. today.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Let me start off with my opening statement, and then we 
will turn to Mr. Grijalva for his.

    <opening>STATEMENT OF THE HON. ROB BISHOP, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESSFROM THE STATE OF UTAH</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP">    The Chairman. Today, we are going to examine how to </paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP">modernize the National Environmental Policy Act. In 1969, NEPA 
was originally intended to be a tool to assess the impacts of 
government actions on the environment. Unfortunately, today it 
has become a sweeping regulatory framework that does the exact 
opposite. Like some of our other bedrock environmental 
statutes, they had a noble intent. But when you write something 
in an open-ended and vague manner of statutory language, it 
simply means that administrations and litigation can make it a 
far cry from what Richard Nixon signed back in 1969.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP">The provisions of NEPA also created, for example, the CEQ, 
which came up with a sweeping climate change for regulatory 
guidance, voluntary guidance, which, fortunately, this 
Administration has been kind enough to rescind from the silly 
guidance that was originally established.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP">The issue, though, for NEPA is that court orders and 
executive branch actions are not going to improve how the bill 
functions if Congress needs to act to enable some common-sense 
changes to correct the deficiencies that are in the way the law 
is being administered. The common refrain that we are hearing 
from Federal agencies, as well as state and local governments 
and small businesses, is NEPA is used as a tool to slow or 
block needed infrastructure projects and rural development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP">Delays and duplications of environmental reviews added cost 
to the program, which drives up the cost of everything from 
milk to lumber to energy. Somebody has to pay for this 
gridlock, and it is the taxpayer. Environmental improvements 
take a backseat to paperwork and court settlements, and that is 
not what was intended decades ago, when this bill was first 
passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP">There are some who are thinking this bill is perfect as it 
is; that attitude is simply short-sighted. The environment can 
have a review, and in a timely manner, and it does not have to 
be mutually exclusive. But it simply won't happen unless 
Congress actually acts to clarify NEPA's intent, its scope, and 
its limitations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="THE HON. ROB BISHOP">There are multiple Executive Orders and agency attempts in 
the past few years to try to streamline NEPA. Congress is more 
than happy to have some oversight necessary in that process. 
But it is clear that Congress has to do the clarifications. 
There is a lesson for Congress with NEPA that when you pass 
vague, open-ended language, you open the door to controversy, 
legal challenges, and a legacy of unintended consequences.</paragraph>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Bishop follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">So, the purpose of our hearing today is examining ways of 
how we can fix a system that is not functioning the way it was 
intended. As noble as those intentions were, it just is broken. 
And we need to find a way of fixing it. Anything needs to be 
modernized as time goes on; this cries for that modernization.
   Prepared Statement of the Hon. Rob Bishop, Chairman, Committee on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">Natural Resources</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">Today, the Committee meets to examine ways to modernize and improve 
the National Environmental Policy Act. Passed in 1969, NEPA was 
originally intended to be a limited tool to assess impacts of 
government actions on the environment. Today, NEPA is a sweeping 
regulatory framework that effects almost every aspect of the American 
economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">The law, like so many other environmental statutes, was created 
with noble intent. However, due to open-ended statutory language, 
differing interpretations of congressional intent, and the exploitation 
of these vagaries by the activist litigants, the law's implementation 
is a far cry from what President Nixon signed decades ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">A provision of NEPA also created the White House Council on 
Environmental Quality. Ironically, the previous administration's CEQ 
attempted to force sweeping climate change regulatory guidance for all 
NEPA actions. I applaud the Trump administration's CEQ for rescinding 
this potentially damaging Executive Order earlier this year. Executive 
branch or court orders have not and will not improve how NEPA functions 
over the long-term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">Rather, to proactively maintain our critical infrastructure, manage 
our public lands and provide critical public services, Congress needs 
to enact common-sense, substantive changes to bring the law to correct 
its deficiencies. This can be accomplished, while at the same time, 
respecting existing environmental protections. The common refrain from 
a myriad of Federal agencies, state and local governments and small 
businesses is that NEPA is used as a tool to slow or block needed 
infrastructure projects and rural development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">Delays and duplication of environmental reviews have driven up the 
cost of a host of critical infrastructure and job-producing projects, 
which in turn, drives up the cost of everything from milk to lumber to 
energy production. Ultimately, taxpayers are paying more for Federal 
bureaucracy, gridlock and lawyers as limited resources for productive 
environmental improvements take a back seat to paperwork and court 
settlements. This is not what was envisioned by Congress when it passed 
NEPA decades ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">Some consider NEPA to be perfect ``as is'' and oppose any changes 
to it. Yet, we can both better protect the environment and allow for 
thorough review and processing of critical economic, energy and 
infrastructure activities in a timely manner. These concepts are not 
mutually exclusive. But it simply won't happen unless Congress acts to 
clarify NEPA's intent, scope and limitations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">Recently, this Committee has made efforts to address some of the 
most glaring problems we have observed in the application of the law. 
In 2015, the Congress passed a narrow modification to NEPA to establish 
best practices among Federal agencies, require coordination of Federal 
agency review of projects, and shorten time periods for legal 
challenges. But just as we observed with original passage of NEPA, it's 
one thing to pass a law with good intentions, it's quite another to 
ensure its application is carried out correctly by agency officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">Similarly, this year has already seen multiple Executive Orders and 
agency attempts at streamlining the NEPA environmental review process. 
I'm eager to provide the congressional oversight necessary to examine 
how these new efforts may positively impact the environmental review 
process in the weeks and months ahead. I am encouraged that the 
Administration agrees that NEPA processes can and must be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bishop ">There is a lesson for Congress with NEPA. When you pass vague, 
open-ended language, you open the door to controversy, legal challenges 
and a legacy of unintended consequences. It is the purpose of today's 
hearing to examine ways to re-establish NEPA as a tool to balance 
environmental needs with economic progress. I look forward to the 
testimony of the witnesses and I yield back.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF THE HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA, A REPRESENTATIVE INCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THE HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA">                                 ______
Member.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Today, the
Majority will once again try to make its case for weakening the 
National Environmental Policy Act. It is a case we have heard 
before, and one that has repeatedly failed to ring true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">In 2005 and 2006, Committee Republicans under former 
Chairman Richard Pombo tried and failed to make this case by 
convening a NEPA task force. This group held a series of 
hearings, issued a Committee Report that featured the opinions 
of those who were interested only in getting out of NEPA 
requirements, and not in using NEPA to strengthen our 
environment and communities. The report was met with harsh 
criticism, particularly because it played fast and loose with 
the facts, and failed to provide evidence for its claims and 
conclusions. Fortunately, none of its harmful recommendations 
to amend NEPA were adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Since the Republicans took the House Majority in 2011, 
however, they have renewed their assault on NEPA. They have 
pushed for drilling, logging, dam building, and other 
environmentally destructive activities to be conducted without 
Federal agency oversight or public review. Time and again, we 
have debunked Republican myths about NEPA causing excessive 
delays, frivolous lawsuits, and damage to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Based on the testimony provided by Majority witnesses in 
advance of today's hearing, we will need to continue refuting 
those false claims. So, here are a few real facts to consider 
before this hearing devolves into yet another forum for making 
NEPA a scapegoat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">First, NEPA simply requires Federal agencies to take a hard 
look at potential environmental impacts of projects they 
undertake or permit. If an agency modifies or abandons a 
proposal after NEPA review, it is because of real environmental 
harm revealed during the review, not because of the NEPA 
process. Blaming NEPA for uncovering bad projects is like 
blaming a tumor on the x-ray that discovered it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Second, 95 percent of NEPA reviews are completed in a 
matter of days using categorical exclusions that exist to 
streamline review of simple, environmentally benign projects. 
Only 1 percent of NEPA reviews require an environmental impact 
statement. These are the most complex projects with the 
greatest potential for environmental harm, and are rightly 
subject to careful review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Third, the size of the American economy has more than 
tripled since NEPA was passed in 1970, from less than $5 
trillion to nearly $17 trillion in GDP. NEPA has helped make 
that economic development more sustainable, more just, and less 
wasteful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Calls to modernize NEPA miss the point entirely: the beauty 
of NEPA is that it is already modern and it is already 
flexible. To quote the Democratic response to the Pombo task 
force report, ``NEPA was a fundamental shift in our Nation's 
public policy and carries no expiration date. The law's call to 
foster and maintain conditions under which man and nature can 
exist in productive harmony is timeless and its insistence on 
meaningful local involvement, sustainable development, and 
deliberate Federal decision making was, and remains, visionary. 
It cannot credibly be argued that we have fully realized this 
vision, nor should we ever stop trying.''</paragraph>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Grijalva follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">Democratic members of this Committee are dedicated to 
ensuring that the NEPA vision remains a central part of all 
discussions regarding the use of resources owned by the 
American people. Today, our members will highlight NEPA's 
successes, and the fact that a lack of resources and trained 
professionals at CEQ and in the agencies is the main driver of 
any inefficiencies and inconsistencies in the implementation. I 
look forward to the hearing, and welcome our witnesses.

    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">Today, the Majority will once again try to make its case for 
weakening the National Environmental Policy Act. It is a case we have 
heard before, and one that has repeatedly failed to ring true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">In 2005 and 2006, Committee Republicans under former Chairman 
Richard Pombo tried and failed to make this case by convening a NEPA 
``task force.'' This group held a series of hearings and issued a 
Committee report that featured the opinions of those who were 
interested only in getting out of NEPA requirements, and not in using 
NEPA to strengthen our environment and communities. That report was met 
with harsh criticism, particularly because it played fast and loose 
with the facts and failed to provide evidence for its claims and 
conclusions. Fortunately, none of its harmful recommendations to amend 
NEPA were adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">Since the Republicans took the House Majority in 2011, however, 
they have renewed their assault on NEPA. They have pushed for drilling, 
logging, dam building and other environmentally destructive activities 
to be conducted without Federal agency oversight or public review. Time 
and again we have debunked Republican myths about NEPA causing 
excessive delays, frivolous lawsuits, and damage to our economy. Based 
on the testimony provided by Majority witnesses in advance of today's 
hearing, we will need to continue refuting false claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">So here are a few real facts to consider before this hearing 
devolves into yet another forum for Committee Republicans to use NEPA 
as a scapegoat:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">&lt;bullet&gt; First, NEPA simply requires Federal agencies to take a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">``hard look'' at the potential environmental impacts of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">projects they undertake or permit. If an agency modifies or</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">abandons a proposal after NEPA review, it is because of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">real environmental harm revealed during that review, not</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">because of the NEPA process. Blaming NEPA for uncovering</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">bad projects is like blaming a tumor on the x-ray that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">discovered it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">&lt;bullet&gt; Second, 95 percent of NEPA reviews are completed in a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">matter of days using categorical exclusions that exist to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">streamline review of simple, environmentally benign</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">projects. Only 1 percent of NEPA reviews require an</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">environmental impact statement. These are the most complex</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">projects with the greatest potential for environmental</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">harm, and are rightly subject to careful review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">&lt;bullet&gt; Third, the size of the American economy has more than</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">tripled since NEPA was passed in 1970: from less than $5</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">trillion to nearly $17 trillion. NEPA has helped make this</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">economic development more sustainable, more just, and less</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">wasteful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">Calls to `modernize' NEPA miss the point: the beauty of NEPA is 
that it is already modern and it is already flexible. To quote from the 
Democratic response to the Pombo task force report: ``NEPA was a 
fundamental shift in our Nation's public policy and carries no 
expiration date. The law's call to `foster and maintain conditions 
under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony' is timeless 
and its insistence on meaningful local involvement, sustainable 
development, and deliberate Federal decision making was, and remains, 
visionary. It cannot credibly be argued that we have fully realized 
this vision, nor should we ever stop trying.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">Democratic Members of this Committee are dedicated to ensuring the 
NEPA vision remains a central part of all discussions regarding the use 
of resources owned by the American people. Today, our Members will 
highlight NEPA successes and the fact that a lack of resources and 
trained professionals at CEQ and in the agencies is the main driver of 
any inefficiencies and inconsistencies in implementation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Grijalva ">I look forward to hearing from our witnesses, and I yield back.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF THE HON. JIM WILLOX, CONVERSE COUNTY COMMISSIONER,</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="THE HON. JIM WILLOX">    With that, let's turn to our first witness, Commissioner 
Willox from Wyoming.
   WYOMING COUNTY COMMISSIONERS ASSOCIATION, DOUGLAS, WYOMING
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Willox">Thank you, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member
Grijalva, and members of the Committee. My name is Jim Willox, 
and I have been a Converse County Commissioner for 11 years, 
and also serve on the board of the Wyoming County Commissioners 
Association, who I represent today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Willox">County commissioners across Wyoming are actively engaged in 
NEPA analysis of all types. I am personally the main point of 
contact for two EISs underway in our county for proposed oil 
and gas projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Willox">Commissioners are elected administrators with broad 
mandates to advance the well-being of our entire county, not 
just one slice of it. With that in mind, I would like to offer 
these suggestions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Willox">It is important to remember Congress' original intent in 
drafting NEPA. In part, it was to encourage productive and 
enjoyable harmony between man and his environment. 
Unfortunately, in recent years, NEPA has mushroomed into an 
exhaustive, analytical effort on every possible negative 
outcome, including on a global scale. Agency officials are 
forced into years of analysis and reams of paper designed to 
fend off litigation, instead of making sound, informed policy 
decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Willox">This has real consequences. The normally pressured Lance, 
an oil and gas project in western Wyoming, is approaching 8 
years of study and drafting. The Converse County EIS in my home 
county is now well into its 4th year. A proposed pipeline to 
carry carbon from western Wyoming is languishing in its 5th 
year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Willox">There are also countless examples of smaller projects that 
are made costlier and result in greater negative impacts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Willox">For example, a small power provider in my county faces 
lengthy NEPA delays to install additional electricity to a 
local wastewater plant, despite the fact that it is parallel 
and adjacent to an existing power line across Federal land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Willox">A Wyoming-based wireless provider is forced to undergo 
NEPA-related analysis to replace their copper lines with fiber, 
upgrading their network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Willox">These types of problems incentivize industry to figure out 
how to route their projects around Federal lands, which result 
in greater impact on the land and the wildlife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Willox">NEPA delays can also be downright dangerous. Wyoming has 
4.6 million acres of forest that has been decimated by insects 
and disease. Yet, accessing these lands to remove fuel loads 
and improve the health of the forest is hindered by NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Willox">There are two actions that Congress and the agencies could 
take that would dramatically improve NEPA before it even 
begins. Congress should write new rules on what constitutes a 
Federal nexus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Willox">For example, in Converse County's EIS, only 10 percent of 
the surface is federally owned. Yet, a well pad that sits on 
private land that drills into private minerals and then 
accesses Federal minerals laterally, up to 2 miles away, is 
considered a Federal nexus, even though no Federal land is 
disturbed. The same is true for telecommunication providers 
attempting to improve their networks over and through Federal 
lands, triggering NEPA review, even when it is a minority of 
the distance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Willox">Second, counties, as units of local government, should be 
afforded great deference by land managers in the Federal 
Government. We agree with the Western Governors' Association 
that states and local governments are not merely stakeholders, 
but rather co-regulators established by Congress. This requires 
a willing partner on the Federal side, and we hope this 
Committee will continue to demand that agencies fulfill their 
coordination responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Willox">Now, once NEPA has been triggered, we believe this 
Committee should consider creating a category of actions or 
locations that would automatically provide for more categorical 
exclusions. Paralleling or replacing existing infrastructure 
should not trigger full NEPA review. Congress should explicitly 
require the agencies to grant categorical exclusions in areas 
like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Willox">The size and scope of Federal EISs are a significant 
administrative burden to county personnel and budgets. The 
Department of the Interior's recent order to reduce the amount 
of pages in EISs is certainly helpful, but only if accompanied 
by the trimming of the exhaustive analysis forced on the agency 
by litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Willox">And finally, the agency should make better use of the tools 
already at their disposal. They should use tiering to reduce 
redundancies, and grant local governments administrative review 
authority at the end of the process to correct errors before 
going public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Willox">In conclusion, counties in Wyoming and across the West are 
ready, willing, and able to assist in the goal of modernizing 
NEPA to ensure that it continues to work for the benefit of 
decision makers.</paragraph>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Willox follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Mr. Chairman, I thank you for this opportunity to testify 
today, and I look forward to questions.
 Prepared Statement of the Honorable James H. Willox, Converse County</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Board of County Commissioners on behalf of the Wyoming County</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Commissioners Association</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, Representative Cheney, 
and members of the House Natural Resources Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today on modernizing NEPA for the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Willox ">My name is Jim Willox. I have served on the Board of County 
Commissioners in Converse County, Wyoming since 2007. I also serve on 
the Board for the Wyoming County Commissioners Association (WCCA). The 
WCCA is a voluntary association of all 23 Wyoming counties that strives 
to advance county level needs through unified action. I am representing 
the WCCA today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Willox ">County Commissioners across Wyoming are actively engaged in Federal 
resource management plan revisions or amendments in various stages, and 
NEPA analysis of all types. I personally am the main point of contact 
for Converse County in the current EIS underway in my county for a 
proposed oil and gas project. Collectively, Wyoming's Commissioners 
have extensive on-the-ground experience with the nitty gritty 
implementation of NEPA, as opposed to the high-level, philosophical 
arguments in Congress, which I hope helps us identify changes to NEPA 
that will help make a difference on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Willox ">The fact is, County Commissioners are often the only people in the 
room with broad policy objectives when it comes to Federal planning and 
environmental analysis. Federal agencies, even state agencies apart 
from the governor, have specific, narrow objectives to advance. While 
that isn't necessarily wrong, Commissioners are elected Administrators 
with a broad mandate to advance the well-being of our entire county, 
not just one slice of it. With that in mind, I would like to offer the 
Committee some suggestions on modernizing NEPA in a way that maintains 
the original objective of the law, but provides the necessary 
flexibility to undertake projects in a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Willox ">nepa delays are costly and sometimes dangerous</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Willox ">It is important to remember Congress' original intent in drafting 
NEPA:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Sec. 2 [42 U.S.C. Sec. 4321]. The purposes of this Act are: To</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Willox ">declare a national policy which will encourage productive and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Willox ">enjoyable harmony between man and his environment; to promote</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Willox ">efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Willox ">environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Willox ">of man; to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Willox ">and natural resources important to the Nation; and to establish</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Willox ">a Council on Environmental Quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Willox ">The Act was designed to be a planning tool that helped to inform 
decision makers about the costs and benefits of proposed actions--for 
both the environment and to ``stimulate the health and welfare of 
man.'' For many years this analysis was effective, timely, and not cost 
prohibitive. Unfortunately, in recent years NEPA has mushroomed into an 
exhaustive analytical effort on every possible negative outcome, 
including on a global scale. What was once a helpful look at proposed 
actions has metastasized into a grotesque perversion of congressional 
intent whereby agency officials are forced into years of analysis and 
reams of paper designed to fend off litigation instead of making sound, 
informed policy decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Willox ">This has real consequences for my county, for Wyoming, and for all 
of the West. The length of time it takes for the Federal Government to 
issue Records of Decision on major oil and gas projects is well-plowed 
ground in this Committee. The Normally Pressured Lance oil and gas 
project in western Wyoming is approaching 8 years of study and 
drafting. The Converse County EIS in my home county is now well into 
its 4th year after the initial Plan of Development was outlined. A 
proposed pipeline to carry carbon from western Wyoming for beneficial 
utilization elsewhere is languishing in its 5th year. These are just a 
few. The delays are costly to the project proponent, but also are a 
burden on local economies and government services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Willox ">In addition to these large projects, there are countless examples 
of smaller projects that are made costlier and result in greater 
negative impacts to the land and wildlife as a result of NEPAs 
mushrooming, for example:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Willox ">&lt;bullet&gt; A small power provider in my county faced lengthy NEPA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Willox ">delays to install additional electricity to a local</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Willox ">wastewater treatment plant because the line crossed Forest</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Service managed grasslands. The proposed route was directly</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Willox ">adjacent to a transmission line already present, and the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Willox ">area has railways, a state highway, and other</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Willox ">infrastructure nearby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Willox ">&lt;bullet&gt; A Wyoming-based wireless provider is forced to undergo,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Willox ">and pay for, NEPA related analysis when they seek to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Willox ">replace copper lines with fiber to upgrade their network,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Willox ">even though analysis may have already occurred, or previous</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Willox ">analysis doesn't meet the ever moving goalposts of what is</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Willox ">required. This is a delay that seems in direct</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Willox ">contradiction to national goals of improving broadband and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Willox ">wireless coverage in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Willox ">These types of problems incent industry to figure out how to route 
their projects around Federal lands even if the route is significantly 
longer. The result is greater impact on the land and wildlife, 
increased burden on county infrastructure, and less efficient projects. 
Not at all what NEPA was intended to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Beyond economic development projects, NEPA delays can be downright 
dangerous. Wyoming is home to over 7 million acres of forested land 
owned by the Federal Government. Over 4.6 million acres of that forest 
has been decimated by insect and disease over the last 20 years. These 
areas are prone to wildfires, and the Forest Service estimates that 
over 100,000 dead and dying trees fall every single day in the forests 
of the West, impacting recreational opportunities and the health and 
welfare of our wildlife and residents. Yet accessing these lands to 
remove fuel loads and improve the health and resiliency of the forest 
is hindered by NEPA, a complete contradiction to NEPA's intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Even though Congress has given the Forest Service some tools--like 
the use of NEPA's categorical exclusions for management in designated 
insect and disease areas--the Forest Service is reluctant to use the 
designation. For example, Wyoming's Governor, Matt Mead, has requested 
over 1.5 million acres be declared Insect and Disease Areas, but to 
date this tool has not been utilized in Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Willox ">modernizing nepa before it even begins</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Willox ">All of the challenges mentioned above are preventable with a few 
relatively minor changes either in statute or in sustained agency 
action. I will mention those below, but first there are two actions 
that Congress and the agencies can take that would dramatically improve 
NEPA for all involved before the NEPA process even begins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Willox ">First, we believe that this Committee and Congress should take a 
hard look at narrowing when a Federal nexus triggering NEPA reviews is 
warranted. When NEPA was passed in 1969 there was no way to anticipate 
changes in technology like horizontal drilling, or the necessity of 
deploying fiber in rural areas as our country shifted almost overnight 
from voice telephone service to a broadband economy. As a procedural 
law only, NEPA should be flexible enough to account for these changes 
while adhering to its original goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Willox ">For example, the Converse County EIS I've already alluded to is in 
an area of Wyoming that does not have significant Federal land 
ownership. In fact, only 10 percent of the surface in the project area 
is federally owned, 83 percent is privately owned. Yet, here we are 4 
years into an extensive NEPA review with even more years to go. A well 
pad that sits on private land, and drills vertically into privately 
owned subsurface before turning horizontally, and then either crosses 
federally owned subsurface or accesses federally owned minerals up to 2 
miles away from the well pad is considered a Federal nexus. In other 
words, no Federal land is disturbed in any way, yet NEPA reviews for 
the entire project, even on private lands, are triggered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Willox ">The same is true for the wireless company mentioned before and 
other telecommunications providers attempting to improve their networks 
over and through Federal lands. In Wyoming's checkerboard, it is 
possible to replace miles of fiber line predominately on private land, 
but still cross some small segment of Federal land, triggering a NEPA 
review for the entire project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Congress should write new rules on what constitutes a Federal nexus 
in the first place so that agency personnel and county governments can 
focus their time, resources, and attention on projects that actually do 
have an impact on Federal lands themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Second, counties, as units of local government, are--or should be--
afforded great deference by Federal land management agencies as 
outlined in the Federal Land Management and Policy Act (FLPMA) and the 
National Forest Management Act (NFMA). Both of these organic Acts 
establish the principle of coordination with local government. In 
separate, but similar ways, Congress made clear--and the courts have 
affirmed--that Federal agencies have an obligation to engage local 
governments in a meaningful way that goes beyond just notice and 
comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Willox ">In Wyoming we have learned that the most lasting and successful 
Federal projects are ones that begin with significant and meaningful 
engagement with local government. We agree with the Western Governors' 
Association that states and local governments are not ``stakeholders,'' 
but rather co-regulators as established by Congress. This elevated 
status requires that local governments come to the table prepared and 
able to meaningfully contribute to planning and project decisions, but 
it also requires a willing partner on the Federal side that is 
genuinely interested in the expertise local governments have to offer. 
This is an ongoing project for both local government and the Federal 
agencies, but one that too often Federal agencies ignore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Willox ">The WCCA, the WGA, the National Association of Counties, the 
Council of State Governments and several others have argued that 
agencies should spend more time and resources in the early stages of 
environmental reviews understanding the needs of state and local 
governments. That effort will pay off with more robust and defensible 
actions. We agree wholeheartedly with that call. But before NEPA 
analysis begins Congress has already directed agencies to engage in 
ongoing, meaningful dialogue with local governments even in the absence 
of a particular project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Willox ">We have been heartened by the recent change in attitude at the 
Department of the Interior to engage with local governments, but the 
mandate of coordination is one that requires constant intentionality on 
our part, and continued oversight on yours, no matter the presidential 
administration. We hope that this Committee will continue to demand 
that agencies fulfill their coordination responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Willox ">nepa improvements once triggered</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Willox ">We have been pleased with the attention Secretary Zinke has paid to 
improving the NEPA process. For the first time in a long time it 
appears that the Department of the Interior is genuinely interested in 
modernizing NEPA in a way that recognizes the expertise that exists at 
the state and local level. In response to the Secretary's memos on this 
topic, the WCCA wrote a series of letters with suggestions on how the 
agency could improve the process administratively, but would like to 
outline a couple of them here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Willox ">First, with respect to actions Congress can take, we believe the 
Committee should consider creating a category of actions or locations 
that would automatically trigger a categorical exclusion where 
significant impact has already taken place. For example, President 
Obama instituted a ``dig once'' rule as it relates to installation of 
public utilities along roadways in an effort to minimize disturbance 
when roads are built and then overbuilt with utilities, including 
broadband infrastructure. While this is laudable, many major roadways 
like Interstate Highways predate these rules and have caused 
significant impact to the landscape from which there is no turning 
back. Rather than cause delays and added costs in analyzing new 
projects in heavily impacted areas, Congress should explicitly require 
the agency to grant categorical exclusions in areas like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Second, the size and scope of Federal EISs are a significant 
administrative burden on county personnel and budgets. The Department 
of the Interior's recent order to reduce the amount of pages in EISs is 
certainly helpful, but only if accompanied by a trimming of the 
exhaustive analysis forced upon the agency by litigation and a greater 
reliance on states and counties to complete analysis. Counties can 
assist in setting appropriate timelines and scoping by early 
involvement--both in coordination as mentioned before--but also as 
cooperating agencies. Counties should be involved in internal ``ID 
teams'' that can set parameters at the front end to limit expansive and 
wasteful analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Further, even though it is costly, we in Wyoming have taken the 
lead at providing to Federal agencies robust and defensible socio-
economic data that should play a greater role in Federal decision 
making. While Interior is required to analyze the economy, culture, and 
custom of the counties, we discovered years ago that the agency was 
woefully unprepared to produce and analyze this data. We have worked to 
establish fact-based, scalable socio-economic profiles the agencies can 
use to bolster decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Willox ">Finally, the agencies should make better use of tools already at 
their disposal. The agencies underutilize the tiering of NEPA documents 
to reduce redundancies. Also, agencies should grant local governments 
administrative review authority at the end of the process but prior to 
the release of the Final EIS in order to correct any remaining issues, 
streamline the Governor's consistency review, and reduce adverse

    <opening>STATEMENT OF MIKE BRIDGES, PRESIDENT, LONGVIEW/KELSO BUILDING</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="MIKE BRIDGES">Next, Mr. Bridges, you are recognized for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="MIKE BRIDGES">AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL, BUSINESS REP. IBEW 48,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="MIKE BRIDGES">                        PORTLAND, OREGON
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bridges">First, I would like to say thank you to the
Chair and the Committee members for the opportunity to share my 
experiences with the NEPA process and its effects on projects 
in my community. My name is Mike Bridges, and I am the 
President of the Longview/Kelso Building and Construction 
Trades Council. I also serve on the Executive Board for our 
state organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bridges">The state organization represents 70,000 skilled men and 
women in the trades whose livelihoods depend on the 
construction of new projects, many of which must be permitted 
through a NEPA process. A number of these new projects are in 
southwest Washington, and I represent a total of $5 billion of 
private capital investment, millions in tax revenue, and 
thousands of jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bridges">One such project is the Millennium Bulk Terminals project 
in Longview, which is where I have built my home and I am 
raising my family. Millennium is cleaning up a 1940s-era 
aluminum smelter and redeveloping it to export U.S. coal to our 
allies in Japan and South Korea. It is a prime example of how a 
project reliant on natural resources can be encumbered with 
delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Millennium submitted permits in February of 2012, the draft 
EIS published 3\1/2\ years later. As we approach the 6-year 
mark, the final EIS has still not been published. Washington 
State published its 13,000-page state final EIS back in April 
2017. Even though its environmental analysis was far larger in 
scope than the Federal, I attribute the delay in the NEPA final 
EIS in part to the way in which the process has been hijacked 
by activists seeking to deny projects that do not align with 
their political agendas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bridges">NEPA was not enacted to function as a political process to 
allow members of the public to voice their approval or 
disapproval of a controversial project, yet multiple NEPA 
hearings I attended on the Millennium project function as a 
public voting booth of sorts. I witnessed singing grandmothers, 
people dressed as their favorite endangered species, and other 
theatrical antics designed not to inform agency officials, but 
to publicly protest the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Hundreds of people wearing red shirts were bussed in from 
other cities and states to protest against the project. Local 
supporters showed up and outnumbered the out-of-town 
protesters. This was great to see, but we should not have to 
pretend that these hearings are useful in the way that Congress 
intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bridges">The Building Trades support responsible and consistent 
environmental regulations, and has been involved in 
environmental improvements at industrial facilities for 
decades, and has also been leading the way to build and invest 
in renewable energy technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bridges">I am not here today to encourage deregulation. The Building 
Trades support a thorough permitting process, but that process 
needs to adhere to the actual regulatory requirements and allow 
for a reasonable timeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bridges">The Building Trades believe that projects like Millennium 
are essential to the journey toward cleaner sources of energy, 
and we know that this terminal can be built and operated safely 
within the environmental requirements of the law, and can 
provide family wage jobs that my members and others in the 
community so desperately need in Cowlitz County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Currently, many of our skilled trade workers are forced to 
make long daily commutes, or even travel to other states to 
find steady work. The Millennium project presents an 
opportunity for my members to return to the days when they 
could go to work in the morning and come home at the end of the 
day in time to have dinner with their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Projects like Millennium also provide the Building Trades 
with the opportunity to replace our aging skilled workforce 
through our on-the-job apprenticeship training programs. We can 
only admit new apprentices into our programs when there are 
opportunities in the marketplace. The Millennium project is 
essential because its size and duration make it possible for us 
to responsibly gauge how many people to start in a career path 
in the trades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bridges">One group we strive to bring into our apprenticeship 
programs are the military veterans through our Homeless to Hard 
Hats program. With a suicide rate of about 20 veterans per day 
nationally, we want the apprenticeship to serve our veterans as 
they have served our country, by providing them with dignity, 
self worth, and family wages that their sacrifice deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bridges">And I am not here today just in support of my members. As 
part of the labor movement, Building Trades cares not just 
about our craft workers, but all workers. In addition to the 
tradesmen and women that will be employed during construction 
of the facility, the Millennium project is projected to produce 
300 direct and indirect full-time, family wage jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bridges">And our concerns are not just limited to the jobs my 
community needs now. We also have real concerns about our 
state's reputation and economic future. The seemingly endless 
arbitrary regulatory process in Washington State will 
discourage future projects that would employ members of the 
building trades in my community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Bridges">In the long term, we in the Building Trades encourage the 
Committee to put some controls around the process to prevent 
this type of abuse. There should be a limit to the amount of 
time an agency can spend on the NEPA process, the type of 
public process it provides, and the number of pages in a final 
EIS. But in the short term, we ask the Committee to insist the 
Seattle Corps District publish the final EIS for Millennium.</paragraph>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Bridges follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">As someone who drives every day through Longview and sees 
the devastation caused by the lack of good jobs, I am asking 
you to help my community. The regulatory process in Washington 
State is broken. The result has been years and millions of 
dollars of lost wages and millions of dollars of added costs to 
projects like Millennium during the review process. Please 
don't let this continue with the Federal process. Thank you.
Prepared Statement of Mike Bridges, President, Longview/Kelso Building 
  and Construction Trades Council, representing the Washington State</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Building and Construction Trades Council</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">introduction</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">I would first like to say thank you to the Chair and the Committee 
members for the opportunity to share my experience with the NEPA 
process and its effects on the projects in my community. My name is 
Mike Bridges and I am the President of the Longview/Kelso Building and 
Construction Trades Council and I serve on the Executive Board of the 
Washington State Building and Construction Trades Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The State Council represents 70,000 skilled men and women in the 
trades whose livelihoods depend on the construction of new projects. I 
have worked alongside these men and women as a Union electrician, and 
now work to serve them by securing opportunities to build world-class 
projects, many of which must be permitted through the NEPA process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">A number of these new projects are in southwest Washington and 
represent a total of $5 billion of private capital investment, millions 
in tax revenue, and thousands of jobs. The majority of my comments will 
discuss the Millennium Bulk Terminals Coal Export Project, which will 
export 44 million tonnes of low-sulfur American coal to our democratic 
allies in Japan and South Korea. This project has been under review for 
over 5 years. Millennium will provide millions in taxes for the region, 
support thousands of family wage jobs during construction and 
operations, all while cleaning up and redeveloping a 1940s era aluminum 
smelter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Another significant project is the proposed Vancouver Energy 
terminal in Vancouver. This critical infrastructure would enable the 
safe transfer of North American crude oil from rail to ship, and 
ultimately the manufacturing of transportation fuels that we use every 
day at West Coast refineries. This project has been under review for 
over 4 years. The Vancouver Energy project will provide $2 billion in 
economic benefit for the region, support thousands of family wage jobs 
during construction and operations, and strengthen U.S. energy 
independence with the potential to displace up to 30 percent of the 
foreign oil imported to the West Coast with lower-carbon North American 
crude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Both these projects have suffered significant permitting delays. 
But for our purposes today, I will use as an example the Millennium 
Bulk Terminals coal export project in Longview, which is where I have 
built my home and am raising my family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">background on millennium bulk terminals</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Longview is an industrial town built on natural resources, 
manufacturing, and trade--all of which are dependent on our deep-water 
ports on the Columbia River. Yet we are a rural community of less than 
50,000 residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The town has weathered multiple economic downturns because we have 
a well-established industrial area that is still home to major global 
manufacturers who rely on ports to export everything from forest 
products to grain to commodities that are mined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">But we have lost a significant number of family wage jobs through 
those economic downturns because of plant closures and staff reductions 
in manufacturing and industrial facilities. We need to create new jobs 
and opportunities for our children by diversifying, and the Millennium 
Bulk Terminals project is an opportunity to provide just what my 
community needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">As a prerequisite for permits, two environmental impact statements 
(EIS) are needed, although both documents study much of the same 
topics. One is prepared under state law by the State of Washington 
Department of Ecology and Cowlitz County (the SEPA EIS). The second is 
prepared under NEPA by the Seattle District Corps of Engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Millennium submitted permits in February of 2012. The NEPA Draft 
EIS published 3\1/2\ years later. As we approach the 6-year mark, the 
Final EIS has still not published.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Washington State published its 13,000-page State Final EIS back in 
April 2017, even though its environmental analysis was far larger in 
scope than the Federal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The first permit required for the coal export terminal, the 
Critical Areas Permit, was issued in July and in the absence of any 
challenges, both the SEPA EIS and the permit are considered final and 
no longer subject to challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The NEPA EIS requires a 401 Water Quality Certification by the 
State of Washington Department of Ecology. The Department of Ecology 
denied the 401 Water Quality Certificate ``with prejudice'' so 
Millennium is both appealing that denial to the State of Washington 
Pollution Control Board and has filed a lawsuit against the Department 
of Ecology in Cowlitz County Superior Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Despite clear limitations expressed by Congress under the Clean 
Water Act, Section 401, which states base their certification decisions 
on specifically enumerated water quality grounds, Ecology's purported 
bases for denial with prejudice were, in fact, entirely unrelated to 
water quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">This is the first time in Ecology's history that it decided to deny 
a 401 certification with prejudice based on SEPA findings it made 
concerning interstate rail capacity, train traffic (and its attendant 
effect on vehicular traffic), train emissions, vibrations and noise, 
and train safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">While the 401 Water Certificate is under legal challenge, the NEPA 
EIS is stalled, although there are only a few weeks of work left to 
complete it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The second set of permits for Shoreline Development was subject to 
a public hearing conducted by a Hearing Examiner appointed by Cowlitz 
County. The Hearing Examiner denied the shorelines permits also on the 
SEPA findings concerning interstate rail capacity, train traffic (and 
its attendant effect on vehicular traffic), train emissions, vibrations 
and noise, and train safety. Millennium is now appealing that decision 
to the State of Washington Shorelines Hearing Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Another legal challenge is underway as a result of the Department 
of Natural Resources (DNR) withholding consent to a sublease between 
the property owner, Northwest Alloys (a subsidiary of Alcoa), and 
Millennium. Millennium prevailed in that lawsuit when the judge ruled 
that DNR action in withholding the sublease was ``arbitrary and 
capricious.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">abuse of nepa process</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">I took time away from my job, as did a number of my members, to 
participate in the NEPA process provided by the Corps of Engineers. 
Rather than functioning as a useful tool to educate agency decision 
makers of the environmental pros and cons of a proposed project and to 
solicit input from the public as Congress intended, NEPA has been used 
to protract and impede agency officials from making a sensible permit 
decision in a reasonable amount of time. I have testified at multiple 
public hearings across Washington State over a period of 5 years and 
yet, the Corps of Engineers has still not completed its environmental 
review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">I attribute the delay in the NEPA Final EIS in part to the way in 
which the process has been hijacked by activists seeking to deny 
projects that don't align with their political agendas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">NEPA was not enacted to function as a political process to allow 
members of the public to voice their approval or disapproval of a 
controversial project. Yet the multiple NEPA hearings I attended on the 
Millennium project functioned as a public voting booth of sorts; 
members of the public were both allowed and encouraged to use the 
public forum to voice their personal sentiment on whether the project 
should be permitted. At these public hearings, I witnessed singing 
grandmothers, people dressed as their favorite endangered species, and 
other theatrical antics, designed not to inform agency officials but to 
publicly protest the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Hundreds of people wearing red t-shirts were literally bussed in 
from other cities and states to protest against the project. Hundreds 
of thousands of people were provided form letters by local and national 
environmental organizations to send to the Corps to clog the Corps' 
record with anti-project comments so that project opponents could tally 
the ``vote.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Hundreds of local supporters showed up and outnumbered the out-of-
town protestors--which was great to see, but we should not have to take 
time out of our work day to support jobs and private investment in our 
community--and pretend that this is useful to the regulatory process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">This is not the informed and reasonable process that Congress 
intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Millennium continues to move forward. The project was issued one 
permit, but had other permits rejected which are now under appeal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">These permits were denied because of impacts which are the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Government, those being interstate rail 
capacity and effects of train traffic, as well as tribal concerns and 
endangered species. Had the NEPA EIS been published, this might not 
have happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Ironically, we fear the Corps will not finalize their work because 
of these politically motivated state decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The Building Trades supports responsible and consistent 
environmental regulations and has been involved in environmental 
improvements at industrial facilities for decades and has also been 
leading the way to building and investing in renewable energy 
technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">I am not here today to encourage deregulation. The Building Trades 
support a thorough permitting process, but that process needs to adhere 
to the actual regulatory requirements and follow a reasonable timeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The Building Trades believe that projects like Millennium are 
essential in the journey toward cleaner sources of energy, and we know 
that this terminal can be built and operated safely and within the 
environmental requirements of the law. And it can provide the family 
wage jobs that my members and others in the community so desperately 
need in Cowlitz County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">cost of regulatory delays to people's lives</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">We know what it means to live in an industrial town. And we support 
Millennium Bulk Terminals and its project in Longview because we know 
what it will do for us locally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Our unemployment rates speak volumes, as do the large number of our 
families who have to rely on free-and-reduced lunches in our schools 
each day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Finding family wage construction trade jobs in Cowlitz County is 
tough. Many of our skilled trades workers are forced to make long daily 
commutes or even travel to other states to find steady work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The Millennium project and others like it present an opportunity 
for my members to return to the days when they could go to work in the 
morning and come home at the end of the day in time for dinner with 
their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Projects like Millennium also provide the Building Trades with the 
opportunity to replace our aging skilled workforce through our on-the-
job training programs, which we refer to as apprenticeship. We can only 
admit new apprentices into our programs when there are apprenticeship 
job opportunities in the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The Millennium project is essential because its size and duration 
makes it possible for us to responsibly gauge how many new people to 
start on a career path so we can keep them busy learning and working 
throughout their entire training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Only 16 percent of residents of Cowlitz County have a college 
degree. I am a firm believer that our children can have a future in 
Longview with a good family wage job and do not necessarily need to 
have a college degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">It has dominated the news lately that the majority of high school 
graduates do NOT get a college education. And many of those that do and 
want to return to the town where they grew up find that the job 
opportunities are few and far between, and end being forced to make a 
home in a different community. This has prompted much discussion at all 
levels of government about how to expand CTE--Career Technical 
Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Career Technical Education is precisely what the Building Trades 
do. Each trade covers the cost of training of the next generation of 
skilled workers, including tuition, books, and tools, all while 
providing benefits like health care and pension contributions. We do 
this without any government funding because these workers are too 
important to us to let budget shortages and partisan politics get in 
the way of their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">This commitment to steady employment throughout the apprenticeship 
program is especially important for some of the more vulnerable groups 
we strive to bring into the Building Trades, such as our military 
veterans. Our Helmets to Hardhats program helps service men and women 
transfer their skills to careers within the construction industry. With 
a suicide rate of about 20 veterans per day nationally, we want the 
apprenticeship to serve veterans as they have served our country by 
providing them with the dignity, self-worth, and family wages their 
sacrifice deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Millennium signed a Project Labor Agreement with the Building 
Trades way back in 2013. This was unusual because it was so early in 
the process, but Millennium truly wanted to show its commitment to 
providing family wage jobs for members of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">As part of the Project Labor Agreement, the company pledged to 
invest in our future by creating opportunities for new workers to learn 
the trades through apprenticeship programs. It also contains a 
commitment to the Helmets to Hardhats program, which is required in all 
Building Trades Project Labor Agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Millennium agreed to use skilled Union Building Trades workers on 
the project, but also agreed to search for these workers locally first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Without the tech boom that the Puget Sound area has enjoyed, our 
community has had to look for other economic opportunities that play to 
our strengths as an industrial community with access to major trade 
routes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The terminal would be an asset to the state's trade network, 
providing private investment in rail and other infrastructure to help 
ensure rapid delivery of other commodities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">This creates jobs in areas well beyond the boundaries of 
Millennium's project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">It also supports infrastructure for future shorelines development 
plans--and the jobs they bring--in places close to home, like Barlow 
Point, a property just downriver from Millennium that the Port of 
Longview recently acquired for growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Millennium's project would add millions in annual tax revenue for 
schools and public services. At a time when state revenue is needed 
most, we've suddenly become very picky about where that tax money 
should come from--which works if you live in Seattle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Millennium is not asking for special tax breaks, like Boeing did, 
or challenging communities to bid against each other, like Amazon is 
doing. Millennium has just asked our community, and our state, to treat 
this project's applications like other port projects have been treated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">This project has endured the most rigorous scrutiny ever by state 
regulators under the most stringent environmental standards in the 
country. Opposing industrial activity, imposing endless regulations and 
cherry-picking export commodities leaves no future for Cowlitz County. 
My Building Trades members just want the same chance that their parents 
and grandparents had here in Longview, which is to have a local job 
with wages that can support a family and actually get to spend time 
with that family after a full day of work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">Millennium's project will provide the jobs and opportunities our 
community needs. That is why the Building Trades support the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">And I am not here today just in support of my members. As part of 
the Labor Movement, Building Trades cares not just about our craft 
workers, but all workers. In addition to the tradesmen and women that 
will be employed during construction of the facility, the Millennium 
project is projected to produce 300 direct and indirect full-time, 
family wage jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">And our concerns are not just limited to the jobs my community 
needs now. We also have real concerns about our state's reputation and 
economic future. The seemingly endless and arbitrary regulatory process 
in Washington State will discourage future projects that would employ 
members of the Building Trades and my community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">recommendations</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">In the long term, we in the Building Trades encourage the Committee 
to put some controls around the process to prevent this type of abuse. 
There should be a limit to the amount of time an agency can spend on a 
NEPA process, the type of public process it provides, and the number of 
pages the Final EIS consumes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">The state EIS was published in April of this year and was more than 
13,000 pages. The Final Corps EIS should not follow suit. The Committee 
should amend the statute to prevent this type of abuse of process, to 
eliminate the political gamesmanship that ensues, and to return the 
statute to its original intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Bridges ">But in the short term, we ask the Committee to insist the Seattle 
Corps District publish the Final EIS for Millennium. As someone who 
drives every day through Longview and sees the devastation caused by 
the lack of good jobs, I am asking you to help my community. The 
regulatory process in Washington State is broken. The result has been 
years and millions of dollars of lost wages, and millions of dollars of 
added cost to projects like Millennium during the review process. 
Please don't let this continue with the Federal process.</paragraph>

Arbitrary and capricious: Rule of law binds agencies
By ROB McKENNA, Former Washington State Attorney General
Olympian Newspaper 11/17/2017
http://www.theolympian.com/opinion/op-ed/article185225268.html
After five years and thousands of hours of public testimony, it took a 
Cowlitz County judge just five seconds to say what many of us have long 
suspected: some state regulators are out of control, and important 
parts of the state regulatory process are now tools of activist groups.
Cowlitz County Superior Court Judge Stephen Warning made his comments 
in response to a dispute over access to the Columbia River for the 
Millennium Bulk Terminals project. They suggest a level of frustration 
not often seen from the bench. The Millennium case is a striking 
example of how agency regulatory processes can be appropriated by 
activists seeking to deny or block projects that don't align with their 
political agendas.
Judge Warning, though, saw through that strategy. His October ruling is 
based on the principle that the rule of law must be applied evenly, 
regardless of politics. Regulatory agencies must not exceed the 
authority granted to them by our elected representatives in the 
Legislature.
The dispute before Judge Warning involves a lease from our state 
Department of Natural Resources currently held by Northwest Alloys, and 
its sublease with Millennium Bulk Terminals. Millennium's proposed coal 
export terminal in Longview, Washington, has been under local and state 
regulatory review for a record five years, and counting. At issue is 
whether Northwest Alloys and Millennium can build a dock under the 
lease.
Just prior to leaving office this year, former DNR Lands Commissioner 
Peter Goldmark denied the requested sublease, citing fiscal issues--not 
environmental issues--for the denial. Three activist groups, including 
Columbia Riverkeeper, Washington Environmental Council, and Sierra Club 
asked the court to consider environmental issues in reviewing 
Goldmark's decision. In July, Warning denied them their request, noting 
that the lease denial must rest on the words in Goldmark's denial 
letter.
Warning again took up the lease issue and whether DNR acted legally in 
denying the sublease. He did not mince words, calling DNR's decision 
``arbitrary and capricious,'' highlighting how out of line the DNR 
decision really was.
We've seen this sort of agency activism before on this particular 
project. In September, the State Ecology Director denied Millennium a 
water permit based on nine factors, none of which had anything to do 
with water. The director has taken to Twitter on multiple occasions to 
issue comments about the project, the tenor of which seems more 
befitting an activist than regulator.
All of this casts doubt on our state regulatory process. Businesses and 
individuals hoping for a fair and timely review of their projects in 
our state are now likely to think twice before starting a project here. 
In the case of Millennium, they're five years and $15 million into this 
process. Other investors are unlikely to have this kind of time or 
money for such a protracted process.
Homeowners have also been affected by serious regulatory delays. Just 
ask rural landowners who have been dramatically affected by the Hirst 
water rights decision. They can share similar stories of wasted time 
and endless fees for wells they cannot dig, on land they cannot sell--
dream homes that have become regulatory nightmares.
Abuse of the regulatory process further political aims is an affront to 
our democracy and must not go unchecked. Judge Warning said as much in 
as little as three words. Let's hope they speak loud enough for all to 
hear them and end such abuse.</paragraph>

    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Bear">Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and
distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify this morning about the National 
Environmental Policy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Bear">At its heart, NEPA is grounded in certain basic beliefs 
about the relationship between citizens and their government. 
Those core beliefs include an assumption that information 
matters, that citizens should actively participate in their 
government, and that the NEPA process should be implemented 
with both common sense and imagination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Bear">NEPA also rests on a belief that the social and economic 
well-being of human beings is intimately interconnected with 
their environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Bear">At the Federal level, NEPA is the law that provides the 
broadest, most systematic way for citizens to know what their 
government is going to do before they do it, and to have some 
input in the analysis leading up to that decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Bear">When proposed actions trigger the need to prepare an EIS, 
the potential consequences are extremely significant, and the 
impacts may last for decades, if not centuries. Time taken for 
the purpose of doing excellent analysis and public involvement 
is time well spent. We also need to remember that citizens who 
are not professional members of trade associations, public 
interest groups, law firms, or otherwise professionally 
employed in the environmental field need real time to review 
documents and write comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Bear">It is true, though, that the NEPA process is delayed at 
times--too many times--for reasons that have nothing to do with 
the environment. In my experience, the major causes are lack of 
staff capacity in the Federal agencies and lack of adequate 
training. My experience is that agency capacity is dramatically 
insufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Bear">When I entered public service in 1981, agencies typically 
had or were building a multi-disciplinary staff to implement 
NEPA. Over time, agency capacity has been severely diminished. 
In some cases, offices have been disbanded and other additional 
responsibilities have been assigned to the point that the NEPA 
capacity has been severely diminished. And one of the worst 
situations I saw, an agency decided not to appoint anybody to 
implement NEPA on the theory that everyone would do NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Bear">Recently a professor at the University of Arizona stated 
that most of the time costs for conducting NEPA right now are 
due to limited staff. NEPA projects wait in line until staff 
are available to do the work. The capacity for training has 
also been decimated. I sympathize with some of the problems 
that both Mr. Bridges and Commissioner Willox pointed out in 
their testimony, which are issues that should never have arisen 
under the current regulations, and I am afraid lack of training 
had something to do with the problems that emerged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Bear">Congress has passed a number of ``streamlining provisions'' 
and transportation authorization bills, as well as the FAST 
Act. A number of those provisions make sense. Some, in my view, 
go too far. Executive Order 13807 seeks to expedite the review 
process with a goal of completing environmental review 
processes within 2 years. CEQ has also taken a number of steps. 
None of these measures will succeed if Federal agencies lack 
skilled, trained staff to implement them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Bear">So, my first recommendation, not surprisingly, is to direct 
agencies through both oversight and through the appropriations 
process to prioritize adequate trained staff to implement NEPA 
and ensure that the executive branch does implement the 
provisions in FAST-41, allowing the collection of fees from 
infrastructure sponsors with some safeguards to ensure 
independence of the agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Bear">If there is any doubt at this point of time that there is a 
problem with staff capacity, additional study of staff 
capacity, or a study, actually, would be very useful. I would 
also recommend the study comparing staff with consultants. 
Special attention should be given to social, economic, and 
health impacts. The quality of that analysis, I agree with Mr. 
Willox, is lacking. And NEPA is all about, as one of the 
sponsors said, a policy for people and the human environment, 
which is the key phrase in NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Bear">I think I will end there. I have other recommendations. I 
ask that my full testimony be included in the hearing record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Bear ">By way of background, I was asked to serve as Deputy General

Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is the agency established by 
Congress with responsibility for overseeing the National Environmental 
Policy Act. In 1983, I was appointed as General Counsel, which was then 
and remains a non-career position. In that role, I had responsibility 
for oversight of implementation of NEPA. I served in that position 
through both terms of President Reagan's administration and that of 
President George H.W. Bush. I resigned from CEQ in October, 1993, and 
resumed responsibilities as General Counsel in January, 1995. I was 
General Counsel at CEQ during the Clinton and the George W. Bush 
administrations until the end of calendar year 2007, when I retired 
from Federal service. My husband and I moved to Tucson, Arizona last 
year and I continue to be active in the field of environmental law 
generally and NEPA specifically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Bear ">the national environmental policy act</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Bear ">As the title suggests, the National Environmental Policy Act, this 
country's environmental magna carta, sets forth this country's policies 
regarding the environment. In discussing NEPA, it is good to begin with 
a reminder of those policies:
``CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION OF NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
Sec. 101 [42 USC Sec. 4331].
(a) The Congress, recognizing the profound impact of man's activity on 
the interrelations of all components of the natural environment, 
particularly the profound influences of population growth, high-density 
urbanization, industrial expansion, resource exploitation, and new and 
expanding technological advances and recognizing further the critical 
importance of restoring and maintaining environmental quality to the 
overall welfare and development of man, declares that it is the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State 
and local governments, and other concerned public and private 
organizations, to use all practicable means and measures, including 
financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster 
and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions 
under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill 
the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future 
generations of Americans.
(b) In order to carry out the policy set forth in this Act, it is the 
continuing responsibility of the Federal Government to use all 
practicable means, consist with other essential considerations of 
national policy, to improve and coordinate Federal plans, functions, 
programs, and resources to the end that the Nation may----
  1.  fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Bear ">environment for succeeding generations;
  2.  assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Bear ">aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings;
  3.  attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Bear ">without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Bear ">undesirable and unintended consequences;
  4.  preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Bear ">national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Bear ">environment which supports diversity, and variety of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Bear ">individual choice;
  5.  achieve a balance between population and resource use which will</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Bear ">permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Bear ">life's amenities; and
  6.  enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Bear ">maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources.'' 42</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Bear ">U.S.C. Sec. 4331.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Congress sought to ensure that Federal agencies implemented these 
policies by mandating a process by which executive branch agencies 
would analyze the environmental and related social and economic impacts 
of a proposed action and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action 
to meet a particular purpose and need identified by an agency. It also 
established CEQ to oversee implementation of the Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Bear ">What is often referred to as ``the NEPA process,'' or more 
globally, the environmental assessment impact process, reflects a 
common-sense approach to decision making. Basically, Federal agencies 
identify a need to take action, develop a proposed action and identify 
reasonable alternatives and analyze the effects of the various 
alternatives. As stated in CEQ's regulation at 40 CFR Sec. 1502.14, the 
``heart'' of an EIS is the alternatives section; without alternatives, 
the analysis simply documents a decision already made instead of 
actually informing it. As then Governor Fruedenthal of Wyoming put it 
once, ``The National Environmental Policy Act is not about what we do 
or do not like. Rather, it is about displaying a true range of 
alternatives to address the issues raised during the planning 
process.'' Letter from Governor David Freudenthal to Rawlins Field 
Office, Bureau of Land Management, March 15, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Bear ">In my view, the most exciting development in NEPA has been the 
formulation of truly reasonable alternatives developed by citizens, 
often coalitions composed of people representing diverse 
constituencies, who present an alternative to an agency and see it 
analyzed in an EIS and on occasion, ultimately chosen in whole or part 
as the agency's decision. That's seems to me to be a true living 
example of democracy in action. In the context of Federal agency 
decision making, NEPA is the law that provides the broadest, most 
systematic way for citizens to know what their government is going to 
do before it happens and to be involved in the analysis leading up to 
the government's decision. It has had an enormous impact in this 
country and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Under CEQ's regulations implementing the procedural provisions of 
NEPA, each department and agency identifies the anticipated level of 
environmental impact, based on its experience, that typically result 
from undertaking the type of actions it normally undertakes to fulfill 
its mission. Actions that have significant impact on the environment 
require preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS). In 
2012, the last year for which CEQ has posted the number of EISs 
prepared, there were 397 draft and final EISs prepared--spread out over 
the 85 some Federal agencies. By far, the preponderance of Federal 
actions come under either categorical exclusions (CEs), which require 
no written documentation under CEQ's regulations. The next most common 
type of proposed Federal action triggers the need to prepare an 
environmental assessment (EA), which may conclude in either a Finding 
of No Significant Impact or a decision to prepare an EIS. Public and 
intergovernmental participation requirements are commensurate with the 
level of impacts. There is a considerable amount of flexibility under 
the CEQ regulations as to how agencies can implement the NEPA process. 
There are also time tested provisions for emergency situations related 
to actions that would normally require an EIS and provisions for 
dispute resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Bear ">At its heart, the NEPA process is grounded in certain basic beliefs 
about the relationship between citizens and their government. Those 
core beliefs include an assumption that information matters, that 
citizens should actively participate in their government, that the NEPA 
process should be implemented with both common sense and imagination, 
and that there is much about the world that we do not yet understand. 
NEPA also rests on a belief that the social and economic welfare of 
human beings is intimately interconnected with their environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Bear ">state and local governments' role in the nepa process</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. Bear ">In NEPA and the CEQ regulations implementing it, states and local 
governments are afforded special roles in the NEPA process. Under 
Section 102(2)(D) of NEPA, an EIS for a Federal action funded through a 
grant program to states may be prepared by a state agency if (i) the 
agency has statewide jurisdiction and has the responsibility for such 
action; (ii) the responsible Federal official furnishes guidance and 
participates in such preparation; (iii) the responsible Federal 
official independently evaluates such statement prior to its approval 
and adoption; and (iv) the responsible Federal official provides early 
notification to, and solicits the views of, any other state or any 
Federal land management entity of any action or any alternative thereto 
which may have a significant impact related to the action and prepares 
a written assessment of any disagreements among such agencies for 
inclusion into the EIS. Additionally, there are several grant programs 
which delegate responsibility for NEPA to the grant recipient; for 
example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community 
Development Block Grant Program and the Urban Development Action Grant 
program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Under CEQ's regulations, a state or local government agency can be 
either a joint lead agencies, typically used when the state has a so-
called ``little NEPA'' law to avoid doing the process twice, or assert 
jurisdiction by law or special expertise to become a cooperating 
agency. If there is state law or local ordinance in addition but not in 
conflict with NEPA, Federal agencies are instructed to cooperate in 
fulfilling those requirements so that one document will comply with 
applicable laws at all levels of government. 40 CFR Sec. 1506.2.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Bear ">During the 1990s, CEQ received many complaints from county 
commissioners in the West, especially from Wyoming and New Mexico, 
about being denied cooperating agency status. In looking into those 
complaints, we determined that these grievances had legitimacy. CEQ 
then guidance documents on cooperating agencies, including quite 
specific guidance regarding county and state governments, and 
instituted an annual reporting requirement for Federal agencies 
regarding cooperating agencies. At present, CEQ is working on a series 
of memoranda that compare and contrast state and local environmental 
review requirements with Federal requirements, as well as providing 
contacts for each jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Finally, in the past few years, there have been congressional moves 
to delegate NEPA compliance in whole or part to states. This has been 
particularly been true for Federal highway activity, which long 
operated under Section 102(2)(D) of NEPA explained above for 
preparation of EISs. Legislation now allows states to assume 
responsibility for determining which activities are categorically 
excluded; for example, earlier this year, the Federal Highway 
Administration published the 3rd renewal of a Memorandum of 
Understanding with the state of Utah in which the state assumes 
responsibility for determining whether certain highway projects can be 
categorically excluded from written NEPA compliance as well as assuming 
responsibility for 30 environmental laws for those actions (while 
excluding government to government consultation with tribes).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Additionally, the recently passed so-called ``FAST Act'' allows up 
to five states to substitute state requirements for environmental 
review for Federal review requirements where state requirements are 
``at least as stringent'' as the Federal requirements proposed to be 
replaced. 30 U.S.C. Sec. 330(d)(1)(A). CEQ recently published, for 
public review and comment, proposed criteria for determining which 
states have requirements that qualify under this Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Bear ">causes of delay</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. Bear ">There is a perception that compliance with NEPA causes significant 
delays in approval of large numbers of proposed actions. Sometimes that 
is true and sometimes it is not.
When NEPA Is the Reason</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Bear ">It is important to acknowledge that in the relatively few instances 
when proposed actions trigger the need to prepare an EIS, the potential 
consequences are extremely significant and ones that the affected 
community likely may live with for decades if not centuries, depending 
on the nature of the action. Time taken for the purpose of doing an 
excellent job of analysis and public involvement is time well spent. It 
is also important to understand that citizens need some real time to 
review document and write comments--more time than ``streamlined'' 
provisions provide. For example, during my tenure at CEQ, the New 
Mexico Cattle Growers Association and New Mexico Wool Growers 
Association both advocated for mandatory 90-day comment periods on all 
environmental assessments. That's not the current rule, but they 
emphatically reminded us that for many in rural America, 30 days is 
simply not a sufficient comment period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Bear ">It is true, though, that the NEPA process is delayed at times, 
whether for preparation of EISs, EAs or even processing categorical 
exclusions--for reasons that have nothing to do with the protection of 
the environment, our communities or public lands. In my experience, 
there are two related reasons for that, both dealing with issues of 
capacity within agencies: lack of staff with responsibility for NEPA 
implementation and lack of training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Bear ">I am not aware of any systematic accounting of staff capacity for 
NEPA implementation within Federal agencies that charts the personnel 
trend over the past few decades. But my experience is that the trend 
has been very much in the wrong direction--that is, dramatically down. 
When I first entered public service in 1981, major departments and 
agencies typically had or were building a multi-disciplinary staff to 
implement NEPA and a network of field offices. For example, the Office 
of Environmental Coordination for the Forest Service ``had national 
responsibility for leadership, NEPA policy and procedures, training and 
oversight. It also had agency responsibility for coordination and 
liaison with other agencies. In 1989 we decided to greatly expand our 
national training effort to ensure that all of our people at the field 
level and all of the knowledge they needed to make environmentally 
sound and defensible decisions . . . [the staff] did an outstanding job 
of developing a national program that involved training a cadre of 
trainers from all the Regions. These people then went back to their 
Regions and developed their Regional Cadre and passed the training to 
all of the National Forests in their Regions.'' Personal communication 
from David Ketcham, first Director of the Office of Environmental 
Coordination, to Dinah Bear, July 14, 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Since that time, agency capacity in all of these aspects has been 
severely diminished. In some cases, offices have been disbanded; in 
others, additional responsibilities have been assigned to the point 
that the capacity for NEPA work is severely diluted. In one of the 
worst situations I've seen, an agency decided not to fill NEPA 
positions on the theory that ``everyone'' would do NEPA. The Task Force 
on Improving NEPA established by this Committee in 2005 identified this 
as an issue and the situation seems to have gotten worse since then. 
Recently, at the University of Arizona, Dr. Kirk Emerson, in the School 
of Government and Public Policy has been working with public land 
agencies and ``we have learned through some of our public land agency 
interviews, most of the time costs for conducting NEPA right now are 
due to limited staff. NEPA projects wait in line, until staff are 
available to do the work.'' Personal communication from Dr. Kirk 
Emerson to Dinah Bear, November 19, 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Further, and importantly, the capacity for NEPA training within the 
agencies has been decimated. Far too many employees learn ``on the 
job'' in ways that do not provide a solid foundation for understanding 
how to do the job. Staff who are not fully trained in implementing NEPA 
often end up doing a lot of extra work in an attempt to make sure they 
are doing the right thing. I recall one gentleman who came to a long 
overdue NEPA training course after being assigned NEPA responsibilities 
for an entire region 6 months prior to the workshop. He had no 
background whatsoever in NEPA when he was assigned the job of advising 
staff throughout the region on difficult NEPA issues. He had faithfully 
written down every question that came to him that he couldn't answer 
and brought them to the workshop for answers. These kinds of situations 
are big problems in the real world--not a NEPA problem, but a training 
and management issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Ms. Bear ">In the past few years, Congress has passed a number of 
``streamlining'' provisions in transportation authorization bills as 
well as the FAST Act to expedite the NEPA process for infrastructure 
projects. A number of those provisions make sense; some, in my view, go 
too far. Executive Order 13807 also seeks to expedite the review 
process with a goal of completing environmental review processes within 
2 years and issuing a single Record of Decision for infrastructure 
projects. Independently over the past decade, CEQ has taken a number of 
steps to both increase transparency regarding the progress of the 
environmental review for infrastructure projects and to reduce delays. 
However, these measures will not succeed if the Federal agencies lack 
skilled staff to implement them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Delegating NEPA responsibilities to the states or local governments 
does not automatically solves the capacity problem. Indeed, depending 
on the state or local government, there may be even less capacity to 
undertake the process. A 2003 GAO report found that 69 percent of 
transportation stakeholders reported that both state departments of 
transportations and Federal environmental agencies lacked sufficient 
staff to handle their workloads. Highway Infrastructure: Stakeholders' 
Views on Time to Conduct Environmental Reviews of Highway Projects, 
GAO-03-545, p. 5. It would be good to have this analysis updated.
When NEPA Is Not the Reason</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Little systematic research has been done by neutral organizations 
on the causes of delay in terms of Federal decision making. GAO 
underscored the paucity of information about NEPA implementation in a 
2014 report, Little Information Exists on NEPA Analysis (GAO-14-369). 
Such research that does exist relates almost exclusively to Federal 
highway actions. Since at least the mid-1990s, the General Accounting 
Office/General Accountability Office (GAO), and the Congressional 
Research Service (CRS), have prepared a series of reports, remarkably 
consistent in their findings, regarding the construction of highway 
projects and the relationship of environmental laws generally and NEPA 
specifically to decision-making timelines. This type of analysis is 
needed more broadly if agencies and/or legislators are going to be able 
to formulate successful approaches to reducing delays. In short, the 
GAO and CRS reports find that a number of Federal projects have indeed 
been delayed or stopped but for reasons that have nothing to do with 
NEPA, although NEPA usually gets the blame. Reasons include lack of 
funding, changes in the proposal by applicants, assessment by 
applicants that the project is no longer desirable for a variety of 
reasons, opposition from citizens and state and local governments. See, 
for example, The Role of the Environmental Review Process in federally 
Funded Highway Projects: Background and Issues for Congress, CRS 7-
5700, R42479, April 11, 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Ms. Bear ">recommendations for modernizing nepa in the 21st century
Increase Capacity and Cut Contracting</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Ms. Bear ">As discussed above, in my view, the lack of trained staff within 
government agencies is a major cause of delay in the NEPA process. 
Changes in the law or regulations won't make a difference if there is 
no who knows about those changes and is equipped to implement them. For 
example, many people concerned about delay in NEPA advocate for 
expanded use of categorical exclusions. I think we've reached if not 
surpassed the limit of acceptable CEs and instead the effort should be 
directed to ensuring that agencies understand how to use them. CEQ 
requires no paperwork to utilize a categorical exclusion once it is 
established, although many agencies do require at least some 
documentation. However, there have been found instances of agencies 
preparing literally hundreds of pages of documents to justify the use 
of a categorical exclusion. The point is that just mandating the use of 
a categorical exclusion doesn't work if there is no staff to implement 
it or the staff that is there doesn't know how to handle a categorical 
exclusion. Why does such a thing happen? Lack of training is the 
primary answer. Further, agencies who don't have the capacity to 
implement seldom have competent oversight either. And CEQ, which is 
ideally situated to do both generic, across-the-board and more focused 
oversight, itself suffers from serious staff shortages. For too many 
years during its 47-year tenure, CEQ has only had one or possibly two 
people charged with overseeing about 85 agencies in the executive 
branch. At other times, it has had a staff of five to seven 
professionals. At that staff level, CEQ can do some serious oversight 
work. With only one or two people, only the firestorm of the day can be 
addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Ms. Bear ">As the result of these capacity problems, when possible, agencies 
now generally hire consultants to prepare NEPA documentation and often 
to run the public involvement process. There are many consulting firms 
that include personnel who are knowledgeable about the NEPA process and 
do a good job from a technical perspective (there are also some, of 
course, who are not up to the task). However, whatever a consultant's 
expertise, using outside personnel inevitably delays the process, 
whether by virtue of the procurement process or the need for oversight 
and review from agency staff that may be unavailable or under 
qualified. In fact, the EIS processes I've seen done in, for example, 2 
years, have been conducted solely by qualified agency staff with 
support of agency leadership. Further, routinely contracting out NEPA 
work dilutes much of the point of the process by often removing agency 
staff from direct contact with the people most interested, concerned 
and affected by the proposed action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Recommendations: Congress should direct agencies, through the 
appropriations process, to prioritize ensuring that agencies have 
adequate trained, competent staff to implement the NEPA process. 
Congress should also continue to authorize shared resources between 
state and Federal agencies, as they have done to expedite both highway 
funding and certain projects designed to mitigate risk of fire near 
communities. The executive branch should implement the provisions in 
FAST-41 authorizing a system to collect fees from infrastructure 
project sponsors to fund environmental review personnel in agencies 
with adequate safeguards to ensure the independence of agency staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Ms. Bear ">If doubt still exists as to the validity of these concerns, 
Congress should direct CEQ or the National Academy of Sciences to 
engage in a comprehensive study of current Federal agency NEPA staffing 
issues, including capacity, training and retention and recruitment of 
experienced staff. Further, CEQ should ensure that agency decision 
makers understand the basic purposes and requirements of NEPA and 
encourage them to work with their staff to implement NEPA in a flexible 
and creative manner. Additionally, I would urge a study be undertaken 
by CEQ and the Office of Management Budget jointly to compare the costs 
of undertaking NEPA review through the use of consultants with the cost 
of maintaining a small core of competent agency staff. The latter would 
be, as the GAO has reported, challenging but not impossible if it is a 
multi-year study and agencies are given direction on budgeting and 
accounting for future fiscal years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Finally, Congress should pause and evaluate before passing further 
streamlining provisions. Before the measures mandated passed by 
Congress in the 2012 MAP-21 transportation authorization bill had been 
implemented, Congress passed further streamlining requirements in the 
FAST Act that caused confusion and delay in implementing these 
measures. Vulnerabilities Exist in Implementing Initiatives Under MAP-
21 Subtitle C to Accelerate Project Delivery, Office of the Inspector 
General, March 6, 20107. The combination of FAST-41, Executive Order 
13807 and other measures taken by the Administration is a lot for 
understaffed agencies to implement and should be evaluated prior to 
further measures.
Increase Efficiency by Using 21st Century Technology</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Ms. Bear ">One obvious suite of measures that the Federal Government should 
take to bring NEPA into the 21st century is to be utilize 21st century 
technology in a manner that both reduces the amount of time needed for 
preparation of NEPA analyses and utilizes the vast amount of 
information stored in NEPA documents to evaluate and improve analyses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Almost 50 years of data and analyses contained in NEPA documents 
and paid for by taxpayers' money should be a treasure trove of 
information for both the public and private sectors. NEPA analyses 
cover all parts of the country, contain ecological, social and economic 
data and after five decades, should be readily available for trends 
analysis. Technical tools such as natural language processing, text 
mining and spatially explicit information retrieval as well as modern 
machine reading systems such as PaleoDeepDive could be utilized to 
facilitate access to this information. Imagine the boon to analyses and 
the understanding on the part of all interested parties if 50 years of 
information about, for example, the ecology, economy and communities of 
the Central Valley of California--or national forests in Idaho--or the 
colonias along the U.S. Mexico border--were available within a day. Yet 
today, no such system exists. Indeed, even obtaining EISs, let alone 
environmental assessments, which have no central filing system, can be 
very challenging and if a person does dig such documents out of the 
National Archives, there is no shortcut to going through each document 
individually in hard copy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Ms. Bear ">CEQ has identified the need to use information technology tools to 
improve the efficiency and management of NEPA reviews and has promoted 
the use of various IT tools such as NEPAassist geospatial systems for 
preparation of NEPA documents. However, the agency's limited resources 
do not currently allow it to tackle the larger issues of making 
available EISs and other valuable NEPA documents, both past and 
present, easily accessible on a government-wide basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Ms. Bear ">While advocating for better use of 21st century technology, I also 
want to stress that it must be remembered that almost one-quarter of 
Americans still do not have access to speedy internet service, 
especially in rural areas. Agencies must not entirely abandon 
production of hard copy documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Recommendation: CEQ should be funded and directed to establish 
(either managed by CEQ directly or by an appropriate institution) a 
publicly available database with sophisticated search capability for 
NEPA documents for the entire executive branch. This effort should 
include the promulgation of technical guidelines for electronic 
submission of NEPA documents going forward into the 21st century.
Improve the Quality and Integration of Economic, Health and Social</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Impact Analysis in the NEPA Process</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Senator Henry Jackson stated during the Senate debate on NEPA's 
passage, ``An environmental policy is a policy for people. Its primary 
concern is with man and his future. The basic principle of the policy 
is that we must strive, in all that we do, to achieve a standard of 
excellence in man's relationship to his physical surroundings. If there 
are to be departures from this standard they will be exceptions to the 
rule and the policy. And as exceptions they will have to be justified 
in the light of public scrutiny.'' Congressional Record-Senate, October 
8, 1969, p. 29056. The core term in NEPA's requirement to analyze the 
effects of proposals for Federal action is the impact on ``the human 
environment'' and the policies set forth in the Act, cited at the 
beginning of this testimony, talk about fulfilling the, ``social, 
economic and other requirements of present and future generations of 
Americans.'' The effects to be analyzed in either an EA or an EIS 
include cultural, economic, social, aesthetic, historic and health 
impacts. 40 CFR Sec. 1508.8.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. Bear ">However, the quality of social and economic analysis is, as a 
general rule, far below that analysis of what are thought of as 
traditional fields of environmental study (i.e., air, water, wildlife). 
Often, social impacts and economic impacts are blurred together and 
merged into something labeled ``socioeconomic effects'' that 
essentially is a data dump of information that may or may not be 
relevant. Further, with some exceptions, human health impacts are 
frequently overlooked or shortchanged in NEPA analyses. See, National 
Research Council, Improving Health in the United States: Health Impact 
Assessment (advocating for improved integration of health impacts into 
the NEPA process as relevant) (2011), available at https://www.nap.edu/
catalog/13229/improving-health-in-the-united-states-the-role-of-health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Some of the shortchanging of analysis regarding impacts on human 
beings is due to a misunderstanding of both the CEQ regulations and 
applicable case law. Those misunderstandings, in turn, have left 
already understaffed agencies bereft, for the most part, of any 
expertise related to human health, community welfare, and economics and 
a proposed action's impacts on all of the above. Some citizens, whether 
western ranchers, residents of inner cities or Native Alaskans, have 
concluded that the law has no room for consideration of impacts on 
human beings. This feeling undercuts citizens' sense of mattering to 
Federal agencies, weakens agencies' understanding of the communities 
they serve and it is wrong as a matter of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Recommendation: CEQ should be directed to work with Federal 
agencies to identify obstacles to accomplishing professionally 
competent economic, social and health analyses and to promote 
recruitment of personnel with these types of credentials to joint 
agency staff or partnerships with appropriate entities, such as public 
health organizations. As needs are identified and as appropriate, CEQ 
should also publish guidance or handbooks on particular issues of 
common concern regarding analyses of these types of impacts.
Make the Process Count by Making Mitigation Binding</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Ms. Bear ">For understandable reasons, the post-decisional aspects of NEPA 
gets short shrift from everyone. The NEPA process is primarily a 
predecisional process and the work and energy focuses on informing that 
decision. NEPA does not require agencies to mitigate adverse impacts 
and nothing in NEPA makes mitigation measures that are included in 
decisions automatically binding. Yet it is rare, if not impossible, to 
find a decision document following the NEPA process that does not 
include mitigation measures. And in some cases, considerable resources 
have been invested in the process of designing mitigation. But are 
those mitigation measures implemented? And if so, do they have the 
desired effect? The answers to these questions are largely unknown. As 
a general rule, little to no monitoring takes place. So the taxpayers 
don't know if commitments made by an applicant or agency are carried 
out and none of us know the effectiveness of those measures if they 
have been implemented. This is not a good situation, either from the 
perspective of the resources being impacted or citizens' trust in their 
government to carry out commitments. Both Congress and citizens should 
expect better from Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. Bear ">In 2011, CEQ issued guidance to Federal agencies regarding 
mitigation and monitoring. Memorandum for Heads of Federal Departments 
and Agencies on Appropriate Use of Mitigation and Monitoring and 
Clarifying the Appropriate Use of Mitigated Findings of No Significant 
Impact. In part, the guidance is based on the excellent, common-sense 
Department of the Army regulation at 32 CFR part 651, Appendix C, which 
requires proposed mitigation measures to be a line item in the 
proponent's budget or equivalent funding document and/or include the 
mitigation commitment in a legally binding document (for example, 
permits or grants). It mandates a monitoring and enforcement program 
for adopted mitigation and provides for situations in which mitigation 
measures are not implemented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. Bear ">The CEQ guidance also discussed how the integration of 
Environmental Management Systems (EMS), used extensively in the private 
sector, or other data or management systems can be integrated into the 
monitoring mitigation commitments. These are especially useful systems 
for monitoring compliance in the context of infrastructure 
developments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Recommendation: Either the National Academy of Sciences or CEQ 
should be tasked to initiate a review of both the implementation and 
effectiveness of mitigation measures for both agency-initiated and 
applicant sponsored actions in selected agencies and report back to 
committees of jurisdiction within 1 year. The report may suggest 
concrete steps to be taken by either Congress or CEQ depending on the 
findings.
Elevate the Role of Tribal Governments in NEPA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. Bear ">I want to end with perhaps the most egregious oversight in NEPA--
the role of tribal governments. While perhaps understandable (although 
not acceptable) in 1969 when NEPA was passed; and less so in 1978 when 
the CEQ regulations were issued, it is completely unacceptable now. The 
CEQ regulations on their face confine cooperating agency status for 
tribes to situations where the effects of a proposed action are felt on 
reservations. 40 CFR Sec. 1508.5 Most Native Americans live off 
reservation in the continental United States and with one small 
exception, Alaska Natives do not live on reservations at all. Tribal 
governments must be recognized as being on a level playing field with 
local and state governments and afforded all due respect as potential 
joint lead and cooperating agencies and should be able to execute all 
other responsibilities afforded state and local agencies. Short 
changing the role of tribal governments in NEPA implementation 
perpetuates a second class status for tribes that never was appropriate 
but is even less so in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. Bear ">______
 Questions Submitted for the Record to Ms. Dinah Bear, Former General</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Counsel White House Council on Environmental Quality</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Questions Submitted by Rep. Denham</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Question 1. Ms. Bear, how does the Council on Environmental Quality 
view this concept of NEPA reciprocity and what are your thoughts on 
utilizing this tool with state water agencies for Bureau of Reclamation 
water storage projects?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer. To be clear, I am no longer with the Council on 
Environmental Quality (CEQ), but I can speak to how Congress and CEQ 
have viewed the state's role in NEPA in the past, including the 25 
years in which I served at CEQ as well as offering my own thoughts on 
the matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Both Congress and CEQ have been very cognizant of the important 
role of states and have provided mechanisms to involve states in the 
NEPA process for Federal agency decision making in a very robust 
manner. For example, NEPA already provides that a state agency or 
official with statewide jurisdiction and the responsibility of carrying 
out a program funded by Federal grants to the states may prepare an 
environmental impact statement (EIS). 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4332(D). If the 
state chooses to do so, the Federal agency involved must provide 
guidance, participate in the process and independently evaluate the EIS 
to ensure that it meets Federal standards. The Federal agency also 
retains the responsibility to defend the EIS in Federal court if there 
is a legal challenge. In my experience, the principal user of this 
provision has been state highway departments, although the provision is 
not limited to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Under CEQ's regulations, a state or local government agency can be 
either a joint lead agency, typically used when the state has a so-
called ``little NEPA'' law to avoid doing the process twice, or assert 
jurisdiction by law or special expertise to become a cooperating 
agency. If there is state law or local ordinance in addition but not in 
conflict with NEPA, Federal agencies are instructed to cooperate in 
fulfilling those requirements so that one document will comply with 
applicable laws at all levels of government. 40 CFR Sec. 1506.2. 
Similarly, joint planning processes, joint environmental research and 
studies, joint public hearings and joint environmental assessments are 
already authorized under the same regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Additionally, there are several grant programs which delegate 
almost complete responsibility for NEPA to the grant recipient; for 
example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community 
Development Block Grant Program and the Urban Development Action Grant 
program. Importantly, these are situations in which the recipient of 
the grant makes the decision about what to do with the funding, with 
applicable statutory parameters, as opposed to a Federal agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Additionally, the recently passed so-called ``FAST Act'' allows up 
to five states to substitute state requirements for environmental 
review for Federal review requirements where state requirements are 
``at least as stringent'' as the Federal requirements proposed to be 
replaced. 30 U.S.C. Sec. 330(d)(1)(A). CEQ recently published, for 
public review and comment, proposed criteria for determining which 
states have requirements that qualify under this Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Here are some additional thoughts:
  1.  The opportunities presented for more robust state involvement,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Bear ">either for assuming responsibility for an entire EIS or</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. Bear ">sharing the responsibility with a Federal agency, were not</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Ms. Bear ">very robustly utilized during my tenure at CEQ (roughly</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1981 through 2007). My sense of the reason for that is that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Ms. Bear ">many states, especially states without a ``little NEPA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. Bear ">law'' at the state level, lacked capacity and were simply</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. Bear ">not interested in assuming that responsibility. With some</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. Bear ">notable exceptions (California), most states and local</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Ms. Bear ">governments were more interested in being cooperating</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. Bear ">agencies than taking the lead role.
  2.  About half of the states do have ``little NEPA laws,'' but the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. Bear ">requirements under those individual state laws vary widely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. Bear ">California's law, the California Environmental Quality Act,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. Bear ">is generally regarded as being stricter than NEPA, for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. Bear ">example, in the area of mitigation. Other state laws are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. Bear ">quite narrow and only apply to certain types of projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Wholesale delegation of NEPA responsibilities to states</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Ms. Bear ">under 50 separate state laws could, I would think,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Ms. Bear ">complicate, not simplify, compliance with NEPA, especially</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. Bear ">for large interstate projects like gas pipelines.
  3.  California already provides that if a project requires compliance</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. Bear ">with both NEPA and CEQA, state or local agencies should use</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Ms. Bear ">the Federal document rather than preparing a separate state</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Ms. Bear ">document and then add to that document the additional CEQA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. Bear ">requirements if they are not included in the state</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Ms. Bear ">document. Cal. Code Regs. Title 14, Sec. 15221. So,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. Bear ">especially in California, with both the CEQ regulations</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Ms. Bear ">mandating joint EISs and CEQA's provision to use NEPA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Ms. Bear ">documents, there rarely, if ever, should be two separate</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Ms. Bear ">documents (i.e., an EIS and an EIR). In my experience, many</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. Bear ">of the failures that lead to separate documents are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Ms. Bear ">management issues, not NEPA issues.
  4.  The purpose of the environmental impact assessment process is to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Ms. Bear ">inform decision making. The responsibility for the process</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Ms. Bear ">needs to be vested in the institutional decision maker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Thus, if a Federal agency is going to make a decision on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Ms. Bear ">the proposed action, that agency should bear responsibility</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Ms. Bear ">for compliance with NEPA. If there is a state involved that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Ms. Bear ">also needs to make a decision, the responsibility for the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Ms. Bear ">environmental review process should be shared jointly, as</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. Bear ">in the statutory and regulatory examples above. If final</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Ms. Bear ">decision making for the proposed action has been</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Ms. Bear ">transferred entirely to states, then it follows that it</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Ms. Bear ">would be appropriate for states to assume the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Ms. Bear ">responsibility for the environmental review process.
  5.  I would warn against wholesale transfer of NEPA responsibilities</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Ms. Bear ">to states for a number of reasons. I have watched several</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Ms. Bear ">instances in which Congress has made available to the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Ms. Bear ">states the opportunity to take over the environmental</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Ms. Bear ">review process--from the amendment to NEPA itself to pilot</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Ms. Bear ">projects in transportation and infrastructure bills. It is</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Ms. Bear ">honestly not clear to me that most states (again, with some</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Ms. Bear ">exceptions) are eager to do this. Assuming such</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Ms. Bear ">responsibility puts a greater burden on states with no</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Ms. Bear ">discernable advantage to them since without assuming the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. Bear ">entire responsibility, state agencies can still be at the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. Bear ">table and share in many (drafting documents, holding public</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. Bear ">hearings, etc.) under current law if they so desire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Implementing a mandate to assume such responsibility also</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Ms. Bear ">puts a burden on the states, unless Congress appropriates</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Ms. Bear ">funding to the states for the purpose of environmental</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Ms. Bear ">review. Also, some state laws, as noted above, are stricter</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Ms. Bear ">than NEPA; others are weaker. Creating 50 different</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Ms. Bear ">standards creates an uneven playing field and a bit of a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Ms. Bear ">nightmare for interstate projects. Finally, to the extent</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Ms. Bear ">the proposed action involves a Federal interest and a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Federal decision, the far better and fairer allocation of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Ms. Bear ">responsibilities and the construct that makes sense in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Ms. Bear ">terms of fulfilling the purpose of the NEPA process is for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Ms. Bear ">the Federal agency to retain the overall responsibility for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Ms. Bear ">the process and partner with affected states to jointly</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. Bear ">implement the environmental review process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Questions Submitted by Rep. Grijalva</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Question 1. Congressman Graves observed that your statement that 
people would be much less likely to know what their government was 
doing before they did it if NEPA were no longer the law made little 
sense because states, local governments and businesses do tell people 
what's going to happen ahead of time on a routine basis. There was no 
time left for you to respond to that point, but would you do so now?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer. Congressman Graves is, of course, correct that many states, 
local governments and sometimes businesses tell people what's going to 
happen ahead of time. In some instances, there is a legal requirement 
for states and local governments to do so. However, that is not 
universally true, especially in the majority of states that do not have 
a broad environmental impact assessment statute of their own. More to 
the point regarding NEPA, there are many Federal actions taken which do 
not come under the jurisdiction of another entity and are not 
associated with a private business. As was brought up by another Member 
during the hearing, this is especially true in the case of military 
installations, where NEPA is typically the sole mechanism for advance 
public notice of activities affecting the public. It is also true of 
public land management, affecting much of the western United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Question 2. Commissioner Willox observed that counties need to be 
part of the identification team working on an EIS and otherwise 
involved early in the process. What is your perspective on this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer. I agree with Commissioner Willox. CEQ has vigorously 
encouraged Federal agencies to include counties (at their request) as 
cooperating agencies, and as such, they should be included on ID teams 
working on an EIS. A concern that Federal agencies had a few years ago 
that inclusion of counties on such teams would be a violation of the 
Federal Committee Advisory Act was addressed by Congress in 1995 that 
provides for the inclusion of state, local, and tribal agency officials 
when working to implement a program that anticipates intergovernmental 
cooperation. It is not clear to me that the existence of this provision 
is known and understood by all relevant agency staff. The National 
Environmental Policy Act and the CEQ implementing regulations 
specifically contemplate cooperative work with such intergovernmental 
representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Question 3. Mr. Howard's proposed amendment to the FAST Act 
purports to bestow upon CEQ dispute resolution authorities. Does CEQ 
currently play a role in dispute resolution in the context of NEPA?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer. CEQ has multiple dispute resolution roles. The most formal 
role is the dispute resolution process established in the CEQ 
regulations to resolve disputes between agencies over a proposed 
action. That process, through which the head of one department refers 
an action proposed by another executive branch department, includes 
timelines, opportunities for both agencies to present their views, 
opportunity for public involvement and ultimate resolution in a number 
of ways, including elevation to the President. 40 CFR Sec. 1504.00 et 
seq. CEQ also has a formal dispute resolution process in the event that 
agencies cannot decide which agency should be the ``lead agency'' for 
purposes of the NEPA process. 40 CFR Sec. 1501.5(3). More frequently, 
CEQ routinely resolves interagency disputes and concerns raised by 
private citizens, governors, Members of Congress and a whole host of 
others who have concerns about a particular implementation issue 
associated with NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Question 4. Mr. Howard specifically recommends that permitting 
processes should take no longer than 2 years, but this one-size-fits-
all approach seems like it would quickly fail for larger and more 
complex projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Ms. Bear ">4a. Is a lack of mandated timelines actually a hurdle to efficient 
environmental review?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer. I do not think that the lack of congressionally mandated 
timelines are a hurdle to efficient environment review; I think the 
lack of qualified staff to manage the NEPA process is a huge hurdle. 
Agencies are not only free to set timelines, they are already required 
to do so if an applicant requests time limits. 40 CFR Sec. 1501.8. 
Interestingly, this is the provision in the CEQ regulations most 
requested by business and industry representatives during the 
development of the regulations, but it is almost never invoked. Besides 
applicants, state or local agencies or members of the public may also 
ask agencies to set time limits. The regulations provide that the 
agency may consider a number of what I believe are quite sensible 
factors in arriving at those time limits and call on agencies to 
designate a person with NEPA responsibility to expedite the NEPA 
process. A big problem today is that many agencies do not have such a 
staff person who is both knowledgeable about NEPA and experienced in 
management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Ms. Bear ">4b. Do you think there would be negative environmental impacts 
caused by this kind of mandated time limit?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer. I am afraid that mandated time limits for all projects will 
have a deleterious effect on the environment. When agency staff get the 
signal that speed is more important than anything else and when 
agencies are understaffed, problems will get missed or short changed. I 
fear that in the rush to meet mandatory timelines, serious oversights 
will come back to haunt our communities and our public lands and that 
future generations will reap the results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Questions Submitted by Rep. Costa
Topic 1: NEPA Delegation Authority</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Question 1. Some states have enacted state level public disclosure 
laws similar to NEPA whose standards meet or even exceed NEPA's 
requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Ms. Bear ">For instance, in 1970 my home state enacted the California 
Environmental Quality Act, which actually mandates that environmental 
mitigation be performed if an action has an impact on the environment. 
Unfortunately, in many instances, analysis under CEQA does not meet the 
statutory requirements of NEPA, leading to duplicative work and delayed 
project delivery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Ms. Bear ">I've heard that this is especially problematic for projects where 
CEQA analysis and review has already been completed and as a result of 
a Federal agency interaction either through a required permit or a 
Federal funding agreement, an environmental review process under NEPA 
is required. In fact, I've heard of some instances where local agencies 
have rejected Federal funding because the delay to complete NEPA, 
despite already having completed CEQA, would result in a greater 
project cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Ms. Bear ">This is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Ms. Bear ">As you've mentioned, Congress has taken some steps to streamline 
these analyses, specifically for highway projects. This could prove 
beneficial to streamline projects in many congressional districts and 
specifically for those projects in California, like the Atwater-Merced 
Expressway that's needed to redevelop Castle Air Field or the 
California High-Speed Rail project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1a. Do you think that there are benefits to allowing projects in 
states that have equally stringent environmental disclosure laws as 
NEPA to move forward under a single environmental analysis?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1b. Is it reasonable for Congress to explore additional ways in 
which NEPA delegation authority can be extended to the states?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1c. In your opinion, what sorts of agency actions lend themselves 
to enhanced delegation authority? For instance, Reclamation projects, 
FERC projects, or projects with Federal grant funds disseminated?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1d. If it is beneficial, is further action by Congress necessary to 
move forward to expand delegation authority?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer. I agree that having separate documents (i.e., an EIS under 
NEPA and an EIR under CEQA) is problematic. In the vast majority, if 
not all, cases, it is also unnecessary and unwarranted. In my 
experience, the problem virtually always lies with bad management of 
the process, not the law itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Ms. Bear ">First, NEPA already provides that a state agency or official with 
statewide jurisdiction and the responsibility of carrying out a program 
funded by Federal grants to the states may prepare an environmental 
impact statement (EIS). 42 U.S.C. Sec.  4332(D). If the state chooses 
to do so, the Federal agency involved must provide guidance, 
participate in the process and independently evaluate the EIS to ensure 
that it meets Federal standards. The Federal agency also retains the 
responsibility to defend the EIS in Federal court if there is a legal 
challenge. In my experience, the principal user of this provision has 
been state highway departments, although there the provision is not 
limited to federally-funded highways. In the case of California, as you 
point out, there is both a strong environmental review law and 
capacity. I am not sure why other agencies, besides the California 
Department of Transportation, don't avail themselves of this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Under CEQ's regulations, a state or local government agency can be 
either a joint lead agencies, typically used when the state has a so-
called ``little NEPA'' law to avoid doing the process twice, or assert 
jurisdiction by law or special expertise to become a cooperating 
agency. If there is state law or local ordinance in addition but not in 
conflict with NEPA, Federal agencies are instructed to cooperate in 
fulfilling those requirements so that one document will comply with 
applicable laws at all levels of government. 40 CFR Sec. 1506.2. 
Similarly, joint planning processes, joint environmental research and 
studies, joint public hearings and joint environmental assessments are 
already authorized under the same regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Finally, CEQA already provides that if a project requires 
compliance with both NEPA and CEQA, state or local agencies should use 
the Federal document rather than preparing a separate state document 
and add to that document the additional CEQA requirements if they are 
not included in the state document. Cal. Code Regs. Title 14, 
Sec. 15221. Indeed, rather than CEQA documents not being adequate for 
purposes of NEPA, my sense is that it is more frequently the other way 
around--additions are needed to a NEPA document to make it compliant 
with CEQA. Even so, there is no reason to have two separate documents 
(and the processes that are associated with each document).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Given that legal authorization and mechanism already exist to not 
only allow but promote one document instead of two documents for 
environmental review and yet we continue to hear of situations where 
two documents are produced, I would suggest a first step would be to 
task either the General Accountability Office (GAO) or the 
Congressional Research Service (CRS) initiate a discrete study to 
identify and analyze perhaps half a dozen of situations where both a 
NEPA and a CEQA document were produced, to determine: (a) the reasons 
that two documents instead of one were produced, and (b) 
recommendations to address those reasons. In the absence of a clear 
understanding of the reasons that existing legal mechanisms were not 
used or did not work, I am concerned that further legislation will not 
actually achieve the intended goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1a. Yes, I think there are benefits to allowing projects in states 
with equally stringent environmental disclosure laws to move forward 
under a single environmental analysis. In my view, that single document 
should be a joint Federal/state document.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1b. Per my answer above, I think a very specific study about the 
reasons current mechanisms for joint documents and processes are not 
utilized should be undertaken prior to passing more legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1c. As noted above, NEPA already provides that a state agency or 
official with statewide jurisdiction and the responsibility of carrying 
out a program funded by Federal grants to the states may prepare an 
environmental impact statement (EIS). 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4332(D). I should 
also add that anyone--an applicant, state, local government or tribe, 
may prepare an environmental assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1d. It is important to keep in mind that the purpose of NEPA is to 
inform decision making and so ultimately, it is the deciding body that 
should have ultimate responsibility for NEPA. Delegating NEPA wholesale 
to the states, for example for FERC projects, makes little sense when 
FERC holds the decision-making authority. On the other hand, when a 
state or local grant applicant is truly the decision-making authority, 
then delegating the environmental review responsibilities makes some 
sense. Congress has already done that in the case of the Community 
Development Block Grant Program and the Urban Development Action Grant 
program. There, the local communities are responsible for NEPA 
compliance and stand fully in the shoes of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (including in Federal court) as opposed to, for 
example, FERC's authority to permit natural gas pipelines, under which 
it has statutory authority in some circumstances to over-rule state 
agencies.
Topic 2: FAST Act Streamlining Provision Implementation</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Question 2. I have heard concerns from many infrastructure project 
stakeholders that too much time is required to complete all of the 
environmental reviews under NEPA (i.e., environmental assessments (EA) 
and environmental impact statements (EIS). The U.S. Department of 
Energy reported that the average completion time for an EIS in 2015 was 
4.1 years, and the average cost was $4.2 million. A 2014 GAO report 
found that the average completion time for an EIS in 2012 was 4.6 years 
from the notice of intent to prepare an EIS through the issuance of the 
record of decision. I have heard that these figures may underestimate 
both time and costs. Available data from Federal agencies generally do 
not account for costs beyond third-party contractor fees, including a 
project applicant's data-development costs. The time estimates do not 
include the work that precedes the decision to prepare an EIS or the 
cost of defending them in court. I have heard other comments that 
expediting reviews could lead to potential litigation which could 
account for longer project delays beyond those that would have occurred 
using a more slow and steadfast approach under NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Specific to infrastructure, there are NEPA streamlining reforms in 
the FAST Act already. With the FAST Act, Congress and the Obama 
administration sought to improve on past attempts to streamline the 
NEPA process by coordinating and expediting NEPA review across a 
broader range of agencies and industry sectors. The Act establishes a 
Federal Permitting Improvement Council (the Council), composed of 
officials from CEQ, OMB, and 13 other Federal agencies, to coordinate 
this streamlining effort. The range of projects covered by the FAST Act 
includes: ``renewable or conventional energy production, electricity 
transmission, surface transportation, aviation, ports and waterways, 
water resource projects, broadband, pipelines, [and] manufacturing.'' 
In addition, the Council has the authority to designate projects in 
other industry sectors by majority vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Ms. Bear ">To trigger the FAST Act, a project must be subject to NEPA; be 
likely to cost more than $200 million; and either: (1) not qualify for 
abbreviated environmental-review processes under any applicable law, or 
(2) because of its size and complexity, would likely benefit from 
enhanced coordination. Important aspects of Title XLI of the FAST Act 
include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Ms. Bear ">&lt;bullet&gt; Coordinated Project Plans. The plans will identify the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Ms. Bear ">lead agency and cooperating agencies and set out a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Ms. Bear ">permitting timeline. The lead agency is to develop the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Ms. Bear ">permitting timetable in consultation with the cooperating</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Ms. Bear ">agencies and the applicant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Ms. Bear ">&lt;bullet&gt; Permitting Dashboard. An expanded online database will</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Ms. Bear ">track the status of Federal NEPA reviews for each covered</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Ms. Bear ">project. The lead agency must post information, including</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Ms. Bear ">the permitting timetable, status of compliance for each</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Ms. Bear ">participating agency, and any memoranda of understanding</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Ms. Bear ">between the agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Ms. Bear ">In summary, the FAST Act already contains NEPA streamlining 
language for infrastructure projects. There seems to be little data on 
whether or not these provisions have been implemented or whether they 
are working to accelerate project delivery in a way that is consistent 
with the public disclosure requirements and alternatives analysis 
required by NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Ms. Bear ">2a. Is there information available about whether the existing 
streamlining provisions have been fully implemented and what effect, if 
any, they have had on project delivery timelines?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Ms. Bear ">2b. If this information were available, would it assist Congress in 
making any policy changes necessary to implement NEPA more effectively?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Ms. Bear ">2c. If this information is not available, how would you recommend 
this information be acquired and presented to Congress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Ms. Bear ">2a. There is some information available about the implementation of 
the streamlining provisions under the FAST Act. A fair amount of 
information can be found on the website of the Federal Permitting 
Improvement Steering Council (https://www.permits.performance.gov/) and 
the Permitting Dashboard (https://www.permits.performance.gov/). The 
FAST Act requires an annual report to Congress, and the first such 
report was filed in April of this year (https://
www.permits.performance.gov/about/news/fast-41-report-Congress) and it 
is worth reviewing. Some of the time to date, of course, has been spent 
setting up the administrative infrastructure to administer the Act. 
However, 38 projects are currently in the pipeline under FAST-41. The 
Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council has issued some 
guidance to agencies. I am concerned about the extent of education and 
training within the Federal agencies about implementation of the Act. 
In terms of understanding the effect of the streamlining provisions, I 
think it may be a bit early to assess the effect yet, as most projects 
in the pipeline, for a variety of reasons (not all related to 
environmental review) are still in process, although 11 projects have 
been completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Ms. Bear ">2b. I do think that analysis regarding the effect of FAST-41 on the 
environmental review process would be useful to Congress in determining 
whether to make further changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Ms. Bear ">2c. I would suggest waiting a bit longer until more projects have 
gone through the FAST-41 pipeline (perhaps 3 years from the date of 
enactment of FAST-41) and then asking either GAO or CRS to analyze the 
impacts of FAST-41, identifying both successes and problems.
Topic 3: Local Development Experience</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Question 3. Recently approved by all permitting agencies last June/
July was a major ``new town'' project in my district that is designed 
for roughly 5,000 new residences, 3 million square feet of commercial 
and light industrial development, two new public schools, parks, 
trails, environmentally sensitive conserved lands, and various other 
related features. That project is now under construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Ms. Bear ">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 
were key permitting agencies for this project, and NEPA compliance by 
these agencies played a major role. Fortunately for this project, both 
the Corps and Reclamation ended up working well together to resolve a 
wide variety of issues, including some tricky NEPA compliance issues. 
Other projects, I am told, have not fared so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Ms. Bear ">However, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight on this project, there 
are at least two areas where I am told we could be doing better:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Ms. Bear ">&lt;bullet&gt; Need for a single lead agency for NEPA compliance. Many</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Ms. Bear ">projects, including the project in my district, require</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Ms. Bear ">permits from two or more Federal agencies. Although the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Ms. Bear ">NEPA regulations contemplate a lead Federal agency for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Ms. Bear ">purposes of NEPA compliance, it is too often the case that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Federal agencies work inefficiently with each other on NEPA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Ms. Bear ">compliance issues, leading to time-consuming delays and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Ms. Bear ">multiple meetings that can sometimes span weeks and even</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Ms. Bear ">months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Ms. Bear ">I believe that the NEPA regulations could be strengthened in that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Ms. Bear ">regard with the intent of squarely assigning the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Ms. Bear ">responsibility of NEPA compliance in one Federal agency for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Ms. Bear ">all the Federal agencies that might be involved on a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Ms. Bear ">particular project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Ms. Bear ">In my home state of California, our NEPA equivalent--CEQA--is an</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Ms. Bear ">excellent model for how this notion of a single ``lead''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Federal agency can work well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Ms. Bear ">&lt;bullet&gt; Scope of analysis. Closely related to the idea of a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Ms. Bear ">``single lead agency'' for each project is the importance</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Ms. Bear ">of defining a suitably encompassing ``scope of analysis''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Ms. Bear ">for purposes of NEPA review. This is particularly important</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Ms. Bear ">for purposes of Section 7 consultation under the Endangered</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Species Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Ms. Bear ">If the ``lead'' Federal permitting agency defines its NEPA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Ms. Bear ">``scope of analysis'' to only include the area of its</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Ms. Bear ">particular permitting jurisdiction, then the other Federal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Ms. Bear ">permitting agencies for that same project may have no</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Ms. Bear ">choice but to prepare their own separate NEPA analysis if</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Ms. Bear ">their permitting jurisdiction does not coincide with that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Ms. Bear ">of the ``lead'' agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Ms. Bear ">For the project in my district, resolution of this particular</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Ms. Bear ">issue took months longer than it needed to, and further</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Ms. Bear ">clarity is needed for future projects. At base, there</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Ms. Bear ">should be a single ``lead'' Federal agency with a project-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. Bear ">specific ``scope of analysis'' that encompasses all Federal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Ms. Bear ">permitting issues, not just those of the ``lead'' agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Ms. Bear ">3a. I have heard from constituents that the 6-year statute of 
limitations applicable to NEPA claims is too long. It creates too much 
uncertainty and can be a sticking point with the project finance 
community. Six years is too long to know whether an approved project is 
going to become the subject of litigation alleging NEPA non-compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Ms. Bear ">The comparable statute of limitations under CEQA is 30 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Ms. Bear ">What are your views on the idea of new legislation to shorten the 
NEPA statute of limitations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Ms. Bear ">3b. Under NEPA, ``alternatives'' to the proposed project that must 
be assessed in an environmental impact statement (EIS) are, according 
to some Federal agencies and some courts, supposed to be reviewed at 
the same level of detail as the proposed project. This project-level 
review of the alternatives can be quite burdensome, difficult or 
impossible to undertake (e.g., how can a bio analysis be undertaken at 
an alternative site that is owned by someone else?), and ultimately, of 
little value to the ultimate analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Ms. Bear ">What are your views on the possibility or need for new NEPA 
regulations to better and more efficiently focus the ``alternatives 
analysis'' component of NEPA review?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Ms. Bear ">3c. Under NEPA, each Federal agency is authorized to develop its 
own list of ``categorical exclusions'' that is intended to be a list of 
activities that are determined to be so relatively minor in their 
potential for environmental impacts as to excuse the need for further 
NEPA analysis. It seems like a good concept, but I wonder if there are 
improvements that could be made. In the interests of streamlining NEPA 
review across all Federal agencies, there may be merit in issuing new 
regulations that list categorical exclusions that are common to all 
Federal agencies (e.g., ``minor construction''), thereby reducing the 
possibility for inconsistent treatment of the same issue by different 
agencies. These common categorical exclusions could be in addition to 
the agency-specific ``CatEx's'' that are already in existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Ms. Bear ">What are your views on the possibility of streamlining the CatEx 
process by issuing new regulations that create categorical exclusions 
that are common to all Federal agencies, perhaps in addition to the 
agency-specific CatEx's that already exist?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer. First, on the topic of lead agencies, as stated, CEQ 
regulations do provide for a lead agency. In the case of disputes over 
what agency should be the lead, CEQ has a 20-day dispute resolution 
process. 40 CFR Sec. 1501.5(e). The regulations do provide for the 
possibility of joint lead agencies and when agencies opt for that 
construct, it is important for the agencies to set out in writing which 
agency is going to undertake what responsibilities. I am happy to learn 
that in your view, the environmental review process ``new town'' 
project in your district worked well under the auspices of the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Ms. Bear ">3a. In regards to the statute of limitations, Congress provided for 
a 2-year (instead of a 6-year) period in the FAST Act. I believe 2 
years is a reasonable period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Ms. Bear ">3b. I strongly believe that alternatives are the most important 
element of the NEPA process, if done correctly. It is through the 
analysis of reasonable alternatives that meet the stated purpose and 
need that better decision can be made as opposed to just mitigating 
impacts from an action. There are numerous examples of agencies 
adopting better alternatives suggested by other governmental agencies 
or public citizens through the NEPA process. Many of those examples 
have resulted in millions of dollars of taxpayers money being saved, 
improved decisions and happier constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Ms. Bear ">That said, there is no set number of alternatives that must be 
analyzed in a NEPA document; the requirement is analyze ``reasonable 
alternatives.'' If an alternative site is not available to the 
proponent, analysis of that site is, as you suggest, of little value to 
the decision maker. Agencies should be (a) aggressive in their pursuit 
of and listening to outsiders about possible reasonable alternatives 
and then (b) make a reasoned judgment about which alternatives are 
reasonable and which are not. Much of this work depends on appropriate 
training and good management. I would put the emphasis on those two 
elements--which are sorely lacking in many agencies--rather than 
changes to the regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Ms. Bear ">3c. There might be some merit in some carefully selected 
categorical exclusions that are applied throughout the executive 
branch. However, recall that agencies operate in extremely different 
types of ecosystems--for example, what would easily qualify as a 
categorical exclusion for projects in the continental United States 
might have considerable impact in the Arctic environment. It is already 
the case, though, that large departments, like the Department of the 
Interior, have promulgated common categorical exclusions that the 
agencies and bureaus within the department can utilize, supplemental by 
agency specific categorical exclusions. It is also important to 
remember that categorical exclusions are not supposed to be the 
equivalent of legislative exemptions from NEPA; if, in a particular 
case, there are extraordinary circumstances, an agency does generally 
need to prepare an EA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Ms. Bear ">I'm not sure there is an awareness of how many categorical 
exclusions already exist but there are hundreds of them. Sometimes we 
are seeing legislation to enact categorical exclusions for actions that 
are already categorically excluded. Agencies have been pressured by 
both CEQ and Congress for at least the past 16 years to promulgate more 
and more categorical exclusions. Rather than focusing on yet more 
categorical exclusions, I would suggest some oversight on how the 
existing ones are used. CEQ requires no paperwork at all for an 
activity that has categorical exclusions. Most agencies do require some 
documentation and it is sensible to put into the file 1-2 pages 
documenting what categorical exclusion was used for a particular 
proposed action so that someone else does not wonder whether NEPA was 
complied with for a particular project. But there is absolutely no need 
for the voluminous paperwork that some staff compile for each use of a 
categorical exclusion; again, often due to lack of training.
Topic 4: Potential Guidance Updates</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Question 4. Some stakeholders have indicated that new guidance from 
CEQ would help streamline Federal review of infrastructure projects by 
clarifying NEPA duties and procedures that are routinely challenged 
legally. This is as important for agencies and projects as for the 
public and the reviewing courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Ms. Bear ">While there are some who believe that the underlying NEPA statute 
is largely sufficient, some stakeholders assert that NEPA guidance has 
not kept pace with the specific issues and arguments that are now 
commonplace. Existing guidance tends to be high-level and conceptual; 
effectively leaving it to the courts to discern what is or is not 
required by NEPA. I have heard that areas for special focus could 
include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Ms. Bear ">&lt;bullet&gt; Purpose and Need--NEPA analysis could properly reflect the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Ms. Bear ">purpose of the proposal before the agency, not the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Ms. Bear ">preferences of policy makers or opposition groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Ms. Bear ">--  For example, the purpose of a proposed interstate natural</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Ms. Bear ">gas pipeline is generally to transport natural gas by pipeline</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Ms. Bear ">from one or more regions or interconnections, to specific</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Ms. Bear ">market areas or interconnections. This purpose is more specific</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Ms. Bear ">than simply meeting the energy needs in a geographic area. Such</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Ms. Bear ">a general purpose could theoretically be met by providing oil,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Ms. Bear ">coal, solar, or hydro power, requiring demand reduction, etc.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Ms. Bear ">But none of these is the proposal before the agency, and none</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Ms. Bear ">expresses the purpose of the project or reflects the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Ms. Bear ">jurisdiction of the reviewing agency (in this case, FERC).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Ms. Bear ">--  To remain pertinent and useful, would it be beneficial to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Ms. Bear ">ensure that the scope of the NEPA review reflect the project's</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Ms. Bear ">purpose?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Ms. Bear ">&lt;bullet&gt; Alternatives--The alternatives analysis could be tailored</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Ms. Bear ">to the purpose of the proposal before the agency, otherwise</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Ms. Bear ">it leads to excessive analysis of irrelevant, tangential,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Ms. Bear ">or infeasible projects that are not before the agency for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Ms. Bear ">action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Ms. Bear ">--  In the example above, solar or hydro power may not be</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Ms. Bear ">considered appropriate alternatives to the gas pipeline</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Ms. Bear ">to the purpose and need of the proposed action of the agency</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Ms. Bear ">and, second, to a more general level of analysis sufficient to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Ms. Bear ">discern whether an alternative is significantly more or less</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Ms. Bear ">burdensome to the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Purpose and Need. The law is very clear that the lead agency has 
the prerogative to define the purpose and need. There is simply no 
suggestion in the law or the CEQ regulations otherwise. 42 U.S.C. 
Sec. 4332(d); see also, 40 CFR Sec. Sec. 1501.5, 1506.5. For example, 
in the case of a proposed gas pipeline, NEPA analysis for a particular 
pipeline would not typically (nor would courts typically) require 
analysis of all types of alternative energy sources. However, if, for 
example, the Department of Energy decided to develop a national energy 
strategy, NEPA compliance for the that policy would need to consider 
various competing sources of energy. The key issue is the scale of the 
decision to be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Courts do recognize that agencies should respect the role of local 
and state authorities in the transportation planning process and 
appropriately reflect the results of that process in the ``purpose and 
need'' statement. North Buckhead Civic Assoc. v. Skinner, 903 F.2d 1533 
(11th Cir. 1990). And to enhance coordination with states, when 
preparing a joint EIS/EIR, for example, it is prudent to develop a 
purpose and need statement that covers both the needs of the Federal 
and state agency. Further detail on the purpose and need requirement 
can be found in an exchange of letters between the Secretary of the 
Department of Transportation and the Chairman of CEQ on this topic, 
posted here: https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/nepapub/
nepa_documents/RedDont/G-CEQ-purpose_need.pdf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Ms. Bear ">1. I agree that for the NEPA analysis to be pertinent and useful, 
the scope of the NEPA analysis should reflect the project's purpose and 
need. That is what the law requires now. Normally, the purpose and need 
should be articulated by the agency in one or two paragraphs. Far too 
often, agencies delegate this job to consultants who are not sure what 
the agency really wants to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Ms. Bear ">Writing the purpose and need statement should be a government 
function. Frankly, I have seen situations where agency leadership 
didn't know why an EIS was being done or what decision they were 
expected to make at the end of the process. If a senior official in an 
agency proposing to do an EIS cannot sit down at the computer and write 
a couple of paragraphs (one or two paragraphs is all that is required) 
about why the agency is proposing to do something, the agency should 
not be initiating the EIS process. This is a management failure, not a 
problem with NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Ms. Bear ">2. NEPA, the regulations and case law are clear that only 
reasonable alternatives that meet the purpose and need of the lead 
agency must be analyzed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Ms. Bear ">The NEPA process, in my view, can and should be used in a sensible 
manner to improve routing of facilities and activities. Let me briefly 
two such examples, both in California:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Ms. Bear ">In the first instance, the Federal Transit Administration and the 
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority worked 
together to review an 8.5 mile light-rail metro extension serving 
southern Los Angeles County communities. Through the NEPA process, a 5-
mile stretch of rarely used existing freight rail line corridor was 
identified that could be used instead of building new tracks. The 
railroad agreed to abandon the line and allow its use for the light-
rail extension. The decision decreased project costs and time and 
reduced environmental disturbances to nearby communities. The project 
is currently being constructed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Ms. Bear ">In the second instance, the U.S. Navy and the National Park Service 
worked together on an environmental assessment that identified better 
routing for Navy flights over Joshua National Park. The result of the 
NEPA process was reduced impacts to visitors and natural and cultural 
resources on a route that actually improved training exercises. In the 
words of the individual who managed this process for the Navy, 
``Because of NEPA, the public and government decision makers were able 
to analyze the need for action, compare environmental impacts 
associated with alternatives, and bring together organizations and 
individuals with competing interests. The draft EA formed a basis for 
government officials and the public to exchange ideas and develop a 
consensus solution. The end result was a win-win solution for the 
National Park Service, the military, the general public, and the 
environment.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Ms. Bear ">The Supreme Court has made it quite clear that NEPA does not 
obligate agencies to choose the most environmentally preferable 
alternative and lower courts have faithfully followed that holding. 
(Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense 
Council, 435 U.S. 519 (1978), holding that while NEPA does set forth 
significant substantive goals for the Nation, its mandate to the 
agencies is essentially procedural--that is, to insure a fully informed 
and well-considered decision, not necessarily a decision the judges of 
the court of appeals would have reached if they had been the decision 
maker.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Ms. Bear ">In my view, it is neither the law nor the CEQ regulations nor 
guidance documents nor case law that is actually driving the large 
volume EISs that are the subject of so much concern. Rather, it is lack 
of good management of the NEPA process. Indeed, courts have expressed 
more concern about lengthy documents than about brevity. Judges don't 
want to read thousands of pages any more than anyone else. What they--
and agency decision makers--should be looking for is actual analysis of 
potential impacts, not pages and pages of material with little 
relevance to the decision. That is why CEQ's regulations already have 
page limits of 150-300 pages for the main body of an EIS. 40 CFR 
Sec. 1502.27. Again, the problem is not the law or the regulations; 
rather, it's lack of trained staff within the agencies and overuse of 
contractors, many of whom get insufficient guidance from their client 
agencies.</paragraph>

    <opening>STATEMENT OF PHILIP K. HOWARD, CHAIRMAN, COMMON GOOD, NEW YORK,NEW YORK</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="PHILIP K. HOWARD">
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Howard">Thank you, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member
Grijalva, and other members of the Committee. Thank you for 
having me here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Howard">I am the Chair of Common Good, which is a not-for-profit 
that has been looking at how we can expedite the rebuilding of 
America's decrepit infrastructure. The context of this hearing 
is that America is living on infrastructure built 50 to 100 
years ago, leaking trillions of gallons of water, wasting vast 
amounts of electricity in a rickety grid, and so forth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Howard">The past 3 years we have written white papers with the help 
of former environmental officials from both parties, convened 
public forums, including senior officials and former 
Secretaries of Transportation from both parties, and there is 
broad agreement in the need to expedite the entire process by 
which infrastructure gets approved, including the environmental 
process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Howard">There is also broad agreement that NEPA is an 
extraordinarily important statute, and probably should be made 
more effective, not less effective. It is a procedural step 
that prevents rash decisions on alterations that might have 
impact for a century or more. It is very important to have a 
pause, to have the facts, to look at the alternatives, so that 
the political leaders can make a decision about whether the 
right balance, as the statute says, between population and 
resources be met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. Howard">Under the regulations on the Council on Environmental 
Quality, environmental reviews, even from the largest projects, 
are not supposed to be more than 300 pages, and it should never 
last more than a year. You would be hard to find an 
environmental review that was that short on a large project, or 
one that did not take years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Howard">NEPA has evolved into something that no one intended. 
Instead of highlighting material issues and alterations, it 
obscures the important facts in mountains of detail. It has 
become an academic exercise of no pebble left unturned. Much of 
the information is useless in the particular project. Requiring 
traffic studies on the replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge or 
raising the roadway of the Bayonne Bridge makes no sense 
because the traffic is not changing. There is no impact to the 
traffic, so why do they have an extensive traffic study?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. Howard">Instead of encouraging public input--actually, I think NEPA 
should do more to encourage public input, it has become an 
exercise available only to the insiders, many of which do not 
have the common good in mind. They are professionals who work 
for a particular advocacy group seeking a particular goal, many 
of which I agree with, but it is not accessible, a 5,000-page 
report is not accessible, to a member of the public. They will 
never have enough time to study a 5,000-page report. The 
density of these reports is driven by fear of litigation, 
because at the end of any project, someone who doesn't like it 
will sue, claiming that some detail is not accurate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. Howard">The process takes years, an average of 4.6 years for large 
projects. And then, on top of that, there is permitting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Howard">In the case of raising the roadway of the Bayonne Bridge 
into Newark Harbor, a project with almost no environmental 
impact, because it uses the same foundations and the same 
right-of-way, it took 6 months to get a Federal agency to agree 
to be the lead agency. Then it took another year of meetings to 
get the scoping of the environmental review correct. This is a 
project that had an environmental assessment, which is 
supposedly a short-form environmental review. The review itself 
was 10,000 pages long, plus another 10,000 pages of appendices 
for a project using the same foundation and right-of-way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Howard">The bottom line is that environmental review for large 
projects is now, typically, dramatically harmful to the 
environment. It is harmful to the environment because it 
prolongs bottlenecks that could be fixed in a matter of a year, 
or 2 or 3. Instead, they are not fixed for 6 or 7 years. We 
quantify those costs in our report, ``Two Years, Not Ten 
Years,'' and it also, combined with permitting delays, often 
doubles the cost to taxpayers, typically, of large projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Howard">The solution, in my view, and we have proposed legislation, 
is to create clear lines of authority. So, among other things, 
the Chairman of CEQ has authority to decide issues on the scope 
and adequacy of review. Still has to comply with NEPA, but can 
say, in the case of the Bayonne Bridge, for example, ``Oh, you 
are using the same foundations and right-of-way? Give me 50 
pages on construction impacts.''</paragraph>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Mr. Howard follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Thank you very much.
Prepared Statement of Philip K. Howard, Chair of Common Good, New York,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. Howard ">New York</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and members of the 
Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify before the Committee 
today about the need to modernize environmental review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. Howard ">America is living on infrastructure built 50-100 years ago. Aging 
roads, fragile power grids, inefficient ports, and an antiquated air 
traffic system hamper America's ability to compete. Traffic 
bottlenecks, leaking pipes, waste overflows, and dirty power generation 
cause unnecessary pollution. Unsafe roads cause thousands of accidents 
each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. Howard ">The upside of modernizing America's decrepit infrastructure is as 
rosy as the current situation is dire. An infrastructure initiative 
will provide upwards of 2 million high-paying construction-related 
jobs, and provide a 21st century platform to enhance America's 
competitiveness. Not rebuilding infrastructure runs irresponsible 
risks. One failure at a critical transit chokepoint--for example, the 
two century-old rail tunnels under the Hudson River that were damaged 
by Superstorm Sandy \1\--could paralyze an entire region.

on the Approval Process for the Gateway Rail Tunnel Project,'' Common 
Good, May 2016.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Rebuilding America's infrastructure requires Congress to do two 
things: Provide funding and create clear lines of authority to give 
permits. Congress provided money in 2009 as part of the $800 billion 
stimulus, but did not give the executive branch the authority to issue 
permits on a timely basis. Because ``there's no such thing as shovel-
ready projects,'' as President Obama put it,\2\ the Administration 
ended up spending only 3.6 percent of the stimulus money on 
transportation-related infrastructure.\3\

Ready,'' New York Times, October 15, 2010.</paragraph>

Advisers, ``The Economic Impact of the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act Five Years Later,'' February 2014, p. 34.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. Howard ">My testimony today will focus on one element of permitting--
environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA). Environmental review should be a vital tool in enhancing public 
input and improving the quality of projects. Instead, environmental 
review has become a bureaucratic swamp that bogs down vital projects 
and a potentially lethal weapon in the hands of anyone who opposes a 
project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. Howard ">The effect, paradoxically, is that environmental review often harms 
the environment. Lengthy environmental reviews typically prolong 
bottlenecks and other inefficiencies which cause pollution. A 2015 
report by the group I chair, Two Years, Not Ten Years, quantified these 
and other permitting costs for different categories of infrastructure 
delays. For example, a 6-year delay in rebuilding our Nation's 
crumbling highway infrastructure would release an extra 51 million tons 
of CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; emissions. America's antiquated power grid wastes an 
amount of electricity equivalent to the output of 200 coal-burning 
power plants.\4\

    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. Howard ">\4\ Philip K. Howard, ``Two Years, Not Ten Years: Redesigning 
Infrastructure Approvals,'' Common Good, September 2015.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Overall, we also found that a 6-year delay more than doubles the 
effective cost of projects (including increased overhead and 
construction costs, lost economic opportunities, and the environmental 
costs of prolonged inefficiencies).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Mr. Howard ">The core flaw in America's review and permitting process is that 
there are no clear lines of authority to make needed decisions to 
adhere to timetables, including to resolve disputes among bickering 
agencies or project opponents. At any step along the way, a project can 
get bogged down in the balkanized bureaucracy. The project to raise the 
roadway of the Bayonne Bridge required 47 permits from 19 different 
Federal, state, and local agencies. With multiple decision makers, even 
preliminary decisions can take years. With the Bayonne Bridge, it took 
6 months to pick the lead agency for environmental review and another 
year to agree on the scope of review. The Bayonne Bridge construction 
had virtually no environmental impact--it used the same right of way 
and foundations as the old bridge--but the final environmental 
assessment ran 10,000 pages, with another 10,000 pages of 
appendices.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Mr. Howard ">\5\ See, e.g., ibid, and Sam Roberts, ``High Above the Water, but 
Awash in Red Tape,'' New York Times, January 2, 2014.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Mr. Howard ">No one deliberately designed this review and permitting process. It 
serves no legitimate public interest, and, by delaying modernization of 
infrastructure, actively harms the environment. Nor do multi-thousand-
page environmental reviews enhance transparency of important issues; 
lengthy reviews obscure them in a jungle of trivial detail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Congress in recent years has improved the process at the margin by 
creating committees to resolve disputes, shortening the statute of 
limitations, allowing some state-level processes to fulfill Federal 
requirements, and improving transparency via the Permitting Dashboard. 
What's needed, however, is a simple hierarchy, where designated 
officials take responsibility to make needed decisions at each step 
without months of delay. I attach here three pages of amendments that 
create clear lines of authority to make decisions needed to adhere to 
reasonable schedules. The effect will be to reduce the effective cost 
of infrastructure by half and to create a greener footprint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Mr. Howard ">the distortion of nepa</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Mr. Howard ">The 1970 National Environmental Policy Act was a landmark statute 
requiring that federally-funded projects review potential environmental 
impacts and consider alternatives before breaking ground. NEPA requires 
agencies to undertake an assessment of the environmental effects of 
their proposed actions so that they can strive to ``achieve a balance 
between population and resource use.'' \6\ NEPA is a tool for 
thoughtful process and democratic accountability, not a substantive 
requirement for environmentally correct decisions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Mr. Howard ">\6\ 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4331.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Mr. Howard ">NEPA is supposed to provide the public with disclosure of major 
impacts, not dense academic analyses. One historian reports that 
``[t]he earliest [environmental impact statements (EISs)] were less 
than 10 typewritten pages in length. They were submitted to the 
Congress and went unchallenged.'' \7\ The current regulations of the 
Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ), created to oversee NEPA, say 
that an EIS should generally be no more than 150 pages, and no more 
than 300 pages for complex projects.\8\

    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. Howard ">\8\ 40 CFR Sec. 1502.7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Mr. Howard ">NEPA has rightly been called ``the Magna Carta of environmental 
law,'' \9\ and 160 nations have adopted similar frameworks for 
environmental analysis of government-backed projects since its 
inception. Other greener countries such as Germany, however, conduct 
their environmental reviews in months, not years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Mr. Howard ">\9\ See, e.g., Daniel R. Mandelker, ``The National Environmental 
Policy Act: A Review of Its Experience and Problems,'' Washington 
University Journal of Law &amp; Policy 32 (2010), p. 293.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. Howard ">What happened in America is that NEPA diverged from its original 
goal of public transparency to being an implied mandate for perfect 
projects. But there is no such thing as a perfect project. Every 
infrastructure project has an environmental cost--a desalination plant 
has a briny byproduct, a new power line or wind farm mars natural 
views, a new highway exit or intermodal facility will disrupt a 
neighborhood. Wringing our hands for years over these effects does not 
make these effects disappear; it just postpones the benefits of the 
projects while making them more expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Mr. Howard ">NEPA provided no private right of action. But activist courts in 
the 1970s implied a right of action, and lawsuits over environmental 
review statements became surrogates for questioning the wisdom and 
design of projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Mr. Howard ">In effect, NEPA litigation transferred power from democratically-
elected officials to project opponents and courts. For example, the 
environmentally-beneficial Cape Wind offshore wind farm project has 
faced numerous NIMBY lawsuits since its NEPA process began in 2001 as 
wealthy beachfront property owners use lawsuits to try to kill the 
project and protect their ocean views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Lawsuits over environmental disclosures triggered a downward spiral 
of ever-denser detail--a process of no pebble left unturned. Former EPA 
general counsel E. Donald Elliott estimates that 90 percent of detail 
in Federal impact statements is there not because it's actually useful 
to the public or decision makers, but because it might help in the 
inevitable litigation--a form of environmental ``defensive medicine.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. Howard ">At this point, environmental review has taken a life of its own, 
often unrelated to any meaningful public purpose. The environmental 
impact statement for the new Mario Cuomo Bridge (replacing the aging 
Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River) spent over 300 pages 
describing the methodology used in the rest of the statement. It also 
included detailed traffic studies despite the fact that the new bridge 
would not meaningfully alter traffic patterns relative to the old 
bridge.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Mr. Howard ">\10\ See Department of Transportation, Federal Highway 
Administration, ``Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project Final 
Environmental Impact Statement,'' July 2012, and Philip Mark Plotch, 
``Politics Across the Hudson: The Tappan Zee Megaproject'' (Rutgers 
University Press, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Fear of litigation skews decision making toward mollifying the 
squeaky wheel. For instance, labor unions sometimes ``greenmail'' 
projects, burying them in environmental lawsuits until project 
proponents agree to labor demands. Striving for consensus means that 
delays can go on for years, often decades. A plan to plug a quarter-
mile gap in a Missouri levee has been studied seven times since it was 
originally proposed, with no resolution in site.\11\

The Obstacles Can Be Big, Too.'' New York Times, November 18, 2017.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. Howard ">At this point, environmental review is often a weapon for opponents 
to demand changes or other concessions that undermine the common good. 
The public harm includes dramatically higher costs and delayed 
environmental benefits. The uncertainty over timing keeps many projects 
on the drawing board, and has been a kind of poison pill deterring 
private capital from committing to infrastructure investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Mr. Howard ">fixing nepa by returning to its original purpose</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. Howard ">The solution is to return to the original purpose of NEPA--to 
provide a short and plain statement of material impacts of projects. 
Congress can achieve this by enacting provisions that allocate 
authority to designated officials, and restating a few basic principles 
that will serve as a course correction to officials and courts. 
Specifically, Congress could enact a statute along the lines of what I 
attach here providing that:
  1.  Permitting processes should take no longer than 2 years, and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Mr. Howard ">authority should be given to designated officials and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. Howard ">courts to allow them to enforce that schedule.
  2.  The Chair of CEQ should have the authority, consistent with the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Mr. Howard ">mandate of NEPA, to decide all issues relating to the scope</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Mr. Howard ">and adequacy of environmental review. For the Bayonne</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Bridge project, for example, the review could have</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Mr. Howard ">consisted of 50 pages on construction impacts, not 20,000</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. Howard ">pages. The CEQ Chair will not have to decide most issues--</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Mr. Howard ">just the availability of a common-sense decision will give</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Mr. Howard ">backbone to officials down the line to resist absurd</paragraph>

and modernize NEPA, Republicans agree to unlock funding sources.</paragraph>

Accelerate Infrastructure Permitting
March 2017
Permitting for infrastructure projects can take a decade or more. 
Multiple agencies oversee the process, with no clear lines of 
authority. Once permits are granted, lawsuits can last years more. 
These delays are costly and, often, environmentally destructive.
To eliminate unnecessary delays, we must give officials authority to 
enforce deadlines and resolve lawsuits in expedited proceedings. To 
accomplish these goals, we recommend amending the FAST Act with the 
following provisions:
  1.  Except in unusual circumstances, decisions to approve</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Howard ">infrastructure projects are made in less than two years.
  2.  The Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Howard ">authority to resolve all disputes regarding the scope and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Howard ">adequacy of environmental review pursuant to NEPA.
  3.  CEQ has the authority to grant a fast track one-year review for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Howard ">those projects that were developed with significant</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. Howard ">consultation with stakeholders and that demonstrate net</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Mr. Howard ">environmental benefits.
  4.  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget has authority</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. Howard ">to resolve inter-agency disputes.
  5.  If state and local permits are delayed past issuance of Federal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Mr. Howard ">permits, the Chief Permitting Officer is authorized to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. Howard ">grant final permits for projects of interstate or national</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Mr. Howard ">significance.
  6.  Judicial review is limited to the question of whether the initial</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. Howard ">review failed to disclose material impacts and practical</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. Howard ">alternatives.
These changes will substantially improve review timetables and reduce 
construction costs while maintaining strong environmental protections 
for federal infrastructure projects. Here is the text of the bill to 
accomplish these amendments, which we call the Get America Building Act 
of 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Mr. Howard ">*****

  Questions Submitted for the Record to Mr. Philip Howard, Chairman,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Common Good</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Questions Submitted by Rep. Costa
Topic 1: NEPA Delegation Authority</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Question 1. Some states have enacted state level public disclosure 
laws similar to NEPA whose standards meet or even exceed NEPA's 
requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Mr. Howard ">For instance, in 1970 my home state enacted the California 
Environmental Quality Act, which actually mandates that environmental 
mitigation be performed if an action has an impact on the environment. 
Unfortunately, in many instances, analysis under CEQA does not meet the 
statutory requirements of NEPA, leading to duplicative work and delayed 
project delivery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Mr. Howard ">I've heard that this is especially problematic for projects where 
CEQA analysis and review has already been completed and as a result of 
a Federal agency interaction either through a required permit or a 
Federal funding agreement, an environmental review process under NEPA 
is required. In fact, I've heard of some instances where local agencies 
have rejected Federal funding because the delay to complete NEPA, 
despite already having completed CEQA, would result in a greater 
project cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Mr. Howard ">This is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Mr. Howard ">As you've mentioned, Congress has taken some steps to streamline 
these analyses, specifically for highway projects. This could prove 
beneficial to streamline projects in many congressional districts and 
specifically for those projects in California, like the Atwater-Merced 
Expressway that's needed to redevelop Castle Air Field or the 
California High-Speed Rail project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Mr. Howard ">1a. Do you think that there are benefits to allowing projects in 
states that have equally stringent environmental disclosure laws as 
NEPA to move forward under a single environmental analysis?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Mr. Howard ">1b. Is it reasonable for Congress to explore additional ways in 
which NEPA delegation authority can be extended to the states?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Mr. Howard ">1c. In your opinion, what sorts of agency actions lend themselves 
to enhanced delegation authority? For instance, Reclamation projects, 
FERC projects, or projects with Federal grant funds disseminated?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. Howard ">1d. If it is beneficial, is further action by Congress necessary to 
move forward to expand delegation authority?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. Howard ">1a. Yes. There are already some procedures in place to allow for 
state-level review documents to be adopted in whole or in part during 
NEPA review, and to the extent practicable this practice should be 
expanded. It makes no sense to duplicate review between state and 
Federal actors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Mr. Howard ">1b. Yes, particularly for projects that mainly impact state and 
local rather than regional interests. That's how Germany divides review 
authority to ensure minimal duplication of effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Mr. Howard ">1c. Projects with primarily a state or local effect should enjoy 
this type of delegation; those with broader effects should have review 
run by the Federal Government. However, even in situations in which the 
state is running review under delegated Federal authority, the Federal 
Government still has a legitimate oversight interest, to ensure that 
local procedures do not impose undue costs or delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. Howard ">1d. Yes, and Congress should explicitly authorize CEQ to delegate 
this authority where appropriate. As noted above, delegation procedures 
have already been incorporated in previous transportation bills, but 
should be expanded to encompass all infrastructure sectors and should 
be explicitly housed in CEQ.
Topic 2: FAST Act Streamlining Provision Implementation</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Question 2. I have heard concerns from many infrastructure project 
stakeholders that too much time is required to complete all of the 
environmental reviews under NEPA (i.e., environmental assessments (EA) 
and environmental impact statements (EIS). The U.S. Department of 
Energy reported that the average completion time for an EIS in 2015 was 
4.1 years, and the average cost was $4.2 million. A 2014 GAO report 
found that the average completion time for an EIS in 2012 was 4.6 years 
from the notice of intent to prepare an EIS through the issuance of the 
record of decision. I have heard that these figures may underestimate 
both time and costs. Available data from Federal agencies generally do 
not account for costs beyond third-party contractor fees, including a 
project applicant's data-development costs. The time estimates do not 
include the work that precedes the decision to prepare an EIS or the 
cost of defending them in court. I have heard other comments that 
expediting reviews could lead to potential litigation which could 
account for longer project delays beyond those that would have occurred 
using a more slow and steadfast approach under NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Specific to infrastructure, there are NEPA streamlining reforms in 
the FAST Act already. With the FAST Act, Congress and the Obama 
administration sought to improve on past attempts to streamline the 
NEPA process by coordinating and expediting NEPA review across a 
broader range of agencies and industry sectors. The Act establishes a 
Federal Permitting Improvement Council (the Council), composed of 
officials from CEQ, OMB, and 13 other Federal agencies, to coordinate 
this streamlining effort. The range of projects covered by the FAST Act 
includes: ``renewable or conventional energy production, electricity 
transmission, surface transportation, aviation, ports and waterways, 
water resource projects, broadband, pipelines, [and] manufacturing.'' 
In addition, the Council has the authority to designate projects in 
other industry sectors by majority vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Mr. Howard ">To trigger the FAST Act, a project must be subject to NEPA; be 
likely to cost more than $200 million; and either: (1) not qualify for 
abbreviated environmental-review processes under any applicable law, or 
(2) because of its size and complexity, would likely benefit from 
enhanced coordination. Important aspects of Title XLI of the FAST Act 
include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Mr. Howard ">&lt;bullet&gt; Coordinated Project Plans. The plans will identify the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. Howard ">lead agency and cooperating agencies and set out a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. Howard ">permitting timeline. The lead agency is to develop the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. Howard ">permitting timetable in consultation with the cooperating</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. Howard ">agencies and the applicant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. Howard ">&lt;bullet&gt; Permitting Dashboard. An expanded online database will</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. Howard ">track the status of Federal NEPA reviews for each covered</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. Howard ">project. The lead agency must post information, including</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Mr. Howard ">the permitting timetable, status of compliance for each</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. Howard ">participating agency, and any memoranda of understanding</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. Howard ">between the agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Mr. Howard ">In summary, the FAST Act already contains NEPA streamlining 
language for infrastructure projects. There seems to be little data on 
whether or not these provisions have been implemented or whether they 
are working to accelerate project delivery in a way that is consistent 
with the public disclosure requirements and alternatives analysis 
required by NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. Howard ">2a. Is there information available about whether the existing 
streamlining provisions have been fully implemented and what effect, if 
any, they have had on project delivery timelines?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Mr. Howard ">2b. If this information were available, would it assist Congress in 
making any policy changes necessary to implement NEPA more effectively?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Howard ">2c. If this information is not available, how would you recommend 
this information be acquired and presented to Congress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Howard ">2a. We are in the process of determining this now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Howard ">2b. Yes, however, there are a number of innovations that the FAST 
Act did not address. For instance, there must be clear lines of 
authority to set timetables and resolve disputes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Howard ">2c. Relevant CEQ and DOT staff would be best equipped to begin 
answering this question, and we plan on meeting with them soon to 
discuss this issue.
Topic 3: Local Development Experience</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Question 3. Recently approved by all permitting agencies last June/
July was a major ``new town'' project in my district that is designed 
for roughly 5,000 new residences, 3 million square feet of commercial 
and light industrial development, two new public schools, parks, 
trails, environmentally sensitive conserved lands, and various other 
related features. That project is now under construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Howard ">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 
were key permitting agencies for this project, and NEPA compliance by 
these agencies played a major role. Fortunately for this project, both 
the Corps and Reclamation ended up working well together to resolve a 
wide variety of issues, including some tricky NEPA compliance issues. 
Other projects, I am told, have not fared so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Howard ">However, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight on this project, there 
are at least two areas where I am told we could be doing better:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Howard ">&lt;bullet&gt; Need for a single lead agency for NEPA compliance. Many</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Howard ">projects, including the project in my district, require</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Howard ">permits from two or more Federal agencies. Although the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Howard ">NEPA regulations contemplate a lead Federal agency for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Howard ">purposes of NEPA compliance, it is too often the case that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Federal agencies work inefficiently with each other on NEPA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Mr. Howard ">compliance issues, leading to time-consuming delays and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Mr. Howard ">multiple meetings that can sometimes span weeks and even</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Howard ">months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Howard ">I believe that the NEPA regulations could be strengthened in that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Howard ">regard with the intent of squarely assigning the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Howard ">responsibility of NEPA compliance in one Federal agency for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Howard ">all the Federal agencies that might be involved on a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Howard ">particular project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Howard ">In my home state of California, our NEPA equivalent--CEQA--is an</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Mr. Howard ">excellent model for how this notion of a single ``lead''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Federal agency can work well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. Howard ">&lt;bullet&gt; Scope of analysis. Closely related to the idea of a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. Howard ">``single lead agency'' for each project is the importance</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. Howard ">of defining a suitably encompassing ``scope of analysis''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. Howard ">for purposes of NEPA review. This is particularly important</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Mr. Howard ">for purposes of Section 7 consultation under the Endangered</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Species Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Mr. Howard ">If the ``lead'' Federal permitting agency defines its NEPA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Mr. Howard ">``scope of analysis'' to only include the area of its</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Mr. Howard ">particular permitting jurisdiction, then the other Federal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. Howard ">permitting agencies for that same project may have no</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Mr. Howard ">choice but to prepare their own separate NEPA analysis if</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. Howard ">their permitting jurisdiction does not coincide with that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. Howard ">of the ``lead'' agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. Howard ">For the project in my district, resolution of this particular</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. Howard ">issue took months longer than it needed to, and further</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Mr. Howard ">clarity is needed for future projects. At base, there</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. Howard ">should be a single ``lead'' Federal agency with a project-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Mr. Howard ">specific ``scope of analysis'' that encompasses all Federal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. Howard ">permitting issues, not just those of the ``lead'' agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. Howard ">3a. I have heard from constituents that the 6-year statute of 
limitations applicable to NEPA claims is too long. It creates too much 
uncertainty and can be a sticking point with the project finance 
community. Six years is too long to know whether an approved project is 
going to become the subject of litigation alleging NEPA non-compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. Howard ">The comparable statute of limitations under CEQA is 30 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. Howard ">What are your views on the idea of new legislation to shorten the 
NEPA statute of limitations?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. Howard ">3b. Under NEPA, ``alternatives'' to the proposed project that must 
be assessed in an environmental impact statement (EIS) are, according 
to some Federal agencies and some courts, supposed to be reviewed at 
the same level of detail as the proposed project. This project-level 
review of the alternatives can be quite burdensome, difficult or 
impossible to undertake (e.g., how can a bio analysis be undertaken at 
an alternative site that is owned by someone else?), and ultimately, of 
little value to the ultimate analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. Howard ">What are your views on the possibility or need for new NEPA 
regulations to better and more efficiently focus the ``alternatives 
analysis'' component of NEPA review?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Mr. Howard ">3c. Under NEPA, each Federal agency is authorized to develop its 
own list of ``categorical exclusions'' that is intended to be a list of 
activities that are determined to be so relatively minor in their 
potential for environmental impacts as to excuse the need for further 
NEPA analysis. It seems like a good concept, but I wonder if there are 
improvements that could be made. In the interests of streamlining NEPA 
review across all Federal agencies, there may be merit in issuing new 
regulations that list categorical exclusions that are common to all 
Federal agencies (e.g., ``minor construction''), thereby reducing the 
possibility for inconsistent treatment of the same issue by different 
agencies. These common categorical exclusions could be in addition to 
the agency-specific ``CatEx's'' that are already in existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Mr. Howard ">What are your views on the possibility of streamlining the CatEx 
process by issuing new regulations that create categorical exclusions 
that are common to all Federal agencies, perhaps in addition to the 
agency-specific CatEx's that already exist?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Howard ">3a. The FAST Act shortened the statute of limitations (SOL) for 
certain transportation projects, but this should be applied to all 
NEPA-related challenges. It is absurd that a disclosure statute should 
have a 6-year SOL. The SOL should be 30-60 days, and court review 
should be fast-tracked, as in preliminary injunction decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Howard ">3b. Here and elsewhere, a rule of reason should be applied to 
ensure that review remains relevant to the project at hand. Some 
projects legitimately need broad, detailed alternatives analysis; for 
others, it's wasteful overkill. There's no hard and fast rule; CEQ 
should be empowered to make scoping decisions like this for every 
project, on a case-by-case basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Howard ">3c. Because of the difference in missions between the various 
agencies, I'm not sure that there's an obvious need for uniformity in 
the CatEx process/ However, CEQ should certainly be empowered to draw 
those guidelines if they deem it necessary.
Topic 4: Potential Guidance Updates</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Question 4. Some stakeholders have indicated that new guidance from 
CEQ would help streamline Federal review of infrastructure projects by 
clarifying NEPA duties and procedures that are routinely challenged 
legally. This is as important for agencies and projects as for the 
public and the reviewing courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Howard ">While there are some who believe that the underlying NEPA statute 
is largely sufficient, some stakeholders assert that NEPA guidance has 
not kept pace with the specific issues and arguments that are now 
commonplace. Existing guidance tends to be high-level and conceptual; 
effectively leaving it to the courts to discern what is or is not 
required by NEPA. I have heard that areas for special focus could 
include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Howard ">&lt;bullet&gt; Purpose and Need--NEPA analysis could properly reflect the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Howard ">purpose of the proposal before the agency, not the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Howard ">preferences of policy makers or opposition groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Howard ">--  For example, the purpose of a proposed interstate natural</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Howard ">gas pipeline is generally to transport natural gas by pipeline</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Howard ">from one or more regions or interconnections, to specific</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Howard ">market areas or interconnections. This purpose is more specific</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Mr. Howard ">than simply meeting the energy needs in a geographic area. Such</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Mr. Howard ">a general purpose could theoretically be met by providing oil,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Mr. Howard ">coal, solar, or hydro power, requiring demand reduction, etc.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Mr. Howard ">But none of these is the proposal before the agency, and none</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Howard ">expresses the purpose of the project or reflects the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Howard ">jurisdiction of the reviewing agency (in this case, FERC).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Howard ">--  To remain pertinent and useful, would it be beneficial to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Howard ">ensure that the scope of the NEPA review reflect the project's</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Mr. Howard ">purpose?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Mr. Howard ">&lt;bullet&gt; Alternatives--The alternatives analysis could be tailored</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Howard ">to the purpose of the proposal before the agency, otherwise</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Howard ">it leads to excessive analysis of irrelevant, tangential,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Howard ">or infeasible projects that are not before the agency for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Howard ">action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Howard ">--  In the example above, solar or hydro power may not be</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Howard ">considered appropriate alternatives to the gas pipeline</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Howard ">project, even if these energy sources are preferred by certain</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Howard ">agencies or groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Howard ">--  I have heard that the breadth of alternatives being</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Howard ">considered has increased to the point where scores of major and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Howard ">minor route alternatives are put under the microscope for an</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Howard ">interstate gas pipeline project. As a result, NEPA seems to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Howard ">have evolved into the vehicle to select the route--which is</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Mr. Howard ">properly the province of the Natural Gas Act--and to ensure</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Howard ">that it has least environmental impact--which is not NEPA's</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Mr. Howard ">charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Howard ">--  The depth of analysis seems to have also increased to the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Mr. Howard ">point where full mapping and resource-by-resource analysis is</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Howard ">often expected for many alternatives, setting up impact</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Mr. Howard ">comparisons between alternatives measured in fractions of a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Howard ">wetland acre, etc. Such broad and intensive analyses require</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Mr. Howard ">months of effort and entail enormous costs that may be out of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Howard ">proportion to the purpose of the alternatives analysis. They</paragraph>

the purpose and the effect of the project. Some projects with narrow 
purposes will have broad effects. Public policy choices require 
balancing effects and purposes, and NEPA was passed to ensure that the 
public and decision makers were able to make informed choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Howard ">Alternatives: New guidance is needed to apply a rule of reason 
standard to the scope and timetable of environmental review. The first 
part of any analysis should be a judgment--by the sponsor and CEQ--
about whether the time and effort spent on environmental review might 
be harmful to the environment. A version of the Hippocratic Oath must 
be applied to environmental review. ``First, do no harm.''</paragraph>

so I am going to apologize ahead of time. That is why I came 
early, so I can leave early. But I apologize. I am not trying 
to walk out because I don't think the significance of what you 
are saying is here. It is extremely significant. It is just I 
am being rude and I am going to walk out. Because of that, let 
me start with some questions by myself, if I could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="The Chairman. Thank you very much">    Mr. Howard, let me start with you. One of the things you 
talked about in your testimony, is simply the fact that the 
goals of NEPA, as it started, have changed. And some of that 
has changed simply because of litigation. Is the goal of NEPA 
that was passed a half-century ago the same goal that we see 
today within the agencies who are administering it?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Howard"> Excuse me?
</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Howard">    The Chairman. The goals of NEPA, have they changed over the </paragraph>

last 50 years?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Mr. Howard">I don't think the goals have changed. I think
the goal of public review remains as valid as it was 50 years 
ago, perhaps even more valid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Howard">    We would encourage public input in advance, instead of 
after, but what has happened is the practice has changed, so 
that the goals have been subverted by a process that takes 
years and ends up interfering with important projects, instead 
of promoting better projects.

    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Mr. Howard">    The Chairman. Has litigation played a portion of that </paragraph>

change in the process of administering this law?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Mr. Howard">Undoubtedly. The fear of litigation, according
to former EPA General Counsel E. Donald Elliott, probably 
accounts for 90 percent of the extra detail. People are scared. 
It is a form of defensive medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Mr. Howard">    People are scared that someone might sue if you don't talk 
about the traffic study for the Tappan Zee Bridge. It might 
change 1 percent, and they will sue that you did not do that 
study. So, then you get months doing a study that makes no 
sense.

made in there, saying that we are harming the environment by 
the way we are dragging out these things. Do you want to go 
through that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Mr. Howard">    How can I convince other people the way we are defending 
the status quo right now actually can harm the environment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Mr. Howard">Well, I would encourage you to talk to leading
transportation officials from the prior Democratic 
administration on the projects that are important for the 
environment and what is holding them up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Mr. Howard">Former Deputy Secretary John Porcari, for example, is 
someone who has spoken eloquently about how delay is harmful to 
the environment. We were involved in trying to expedite the 
projects for the gateway tunnel going into New York. The delay 
in that process dramatically increased the risk that the 
decrepit existing 100-year-old tunnels would close down. If 
they close down, which they do in a way that cannot be 
predicted, there is a 25-mile gridlock, which causes enormous 
pollution, as well as disruption of the economy.</paragraph>

bottlenecks, the water mains that leak, all of those things are

</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. Mr</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="The Chairman. Mr"> Willox, can I ask you a simple question?
We have heard part of the process is we don't have enough 
staff. How could counties like yours assist the Federal 
agencies to move the review process efficiently?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Mr. Willox">Well, Mr. Chairman, as I indicated, I think it
is important that counties get engaged early and often in the 
process. That does require a commitment on the counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Willox">    But even when the project is being proposed, before it is 
right in that formal setting, if we can be engaged early, we 
can help provide some of the social economic data that is 
important, some of the understanding of the local community and 
environment. So, early involvement would be definitely 
beneficial.

    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Mr. Willox">    The Chairman. Early in your testimony, you talked about </paragraph>

consultation and coordination with local officials. That is 
happening at a haphazard level right now. Would it be helpful 
if we actually defined what would take place, and insist that 
local officials have to be part of this process?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Willox"> Mr. Chairman, I do think that would be helpful.
Coordination is already part of the law, but it is implemented 
differently by different field offices and different directors. 
It does require a commitment on the local government officials, 
but I think the outcome would be better if that was more 
uniformly instigated at the local level.

some way, so agencies know what they are and are not supposed

    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Willox">    Mr. Bridges, I just have one simple question for you. You 
mentioned some of the people who turn up at hearings, and some 
of the testimony becomes more circus than it is reality. Are 
you telling me that sometimes our hearing process and our 
comment periods, they are really silly and useless?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Bridges">It seems to be. They can be pretty interesting
at times. And they are given a lot of latitude to just come in, 
and I was probably understating some of the stuff I have seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    For people that are protesting the projects, it is really 
emotion-based, and not a lot of fact-based. And there isn't any 
fact-checking with anything for the most part. They are just 
allowed to do their thing. And when I go there to do what I do, 
and our other people go to support the project, it is kind of 
intimidating. So, it is really hard for us to, even though we 
do----

    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="The Chairman. All right, thank you">    Mr. Grijalva, you are up.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"> I was going to defer to Ms. Tsongas.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>The Chairman. Ms</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="The Chairman. Ms"> Tsongas, you are up, then.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Tsongas</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our
witnesses for being here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">As you all know, the National Environmental Policy Act is 
one of our Nation's bedrock environmental laws, and I was 
grateful to hear our Chairman say that, as well. Crafted on a 
bipartisan basis by Congress and signed into law by President 
Nixon, NEPA has informed Federal decision making and increased 
transparency for over 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">To put it simply, NEPA makes sure that we ``look before we 
leap,'' and are using taxpayer dollars wisely. NEPA is also one 
of the primary ways through which the public is able to 
participate in the Federal decision-making process, fulfilling 
the fundamental right of American citizens to have a voice 
regarding a proposed Federal project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">We saw the benefits of this public input process in my own 
district several years ago during a major Federal highway 
project. Thanks to the NEPA process, the project improved 
nearby wetlands and led to the construction of noise barriers 
to mitigate impacts on neighbors. The public comments that were 
submitted by my constituents demonstrate the immense popularity 
and benefits of the public review process, which would not have 
been possible without NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">For example, a local trucking company submitted comments 
saying, ``All the neighborhood residents, the commercial 
businesses, homeowners, and general public have been invited to 
each meeting and hearing. All comments are welcomed. Everyone 
in attendance feels that they have had a say in the development 
of this project.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">Another resident wrote, ``The project team has been 
excellent to work with. They have done an outstanding job of 
listening to the residents of Mathuen and, whenever possible, 
take local input.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">Even residents who could have been negatively impacted came 
around to support the project, thanks to the NEPA public 
outreach process. ``Although our land will be impacted, and the 
state will be taking some of it, we definitely support the 
project. We believe this project is necessary for the improved 
safety of everyone at the intersection, and for the economic 
development of the community. The engineers and architects for 
this project have done an excellent job listening to the 
community and modifying the plans whenever practical.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">All these examples from my district show that NEPA ensures 
that all citizens have a right to participate in the decision-
making process, and it ultimately improves the likelihood of 
long-term success and public support. And I have seen the 
benefit of this highway project, as it has gone forward in the 
ways in which the community has rallied around it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">    Ms. Bear, as has been referenced, the vast majority of NEPA 
projects do not require a significant environmental impact 
statement. Ninety-five percent of all NEPA reviews are 
completed in just a few days. Just 1 percent of projects 
require a more comprehensive environmental impact statement. 
Can you describe your experience with those 1 percent of 
projects that do require a longer environmental review? In 
these cases, why is it so important that we take a hard look at 
a project's potential impacts?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Ms. Bear">Well, the easy answer is because those are the
proposed actions that are going to have significant 
environmental impacts, as the threshold for doing an 
environmental impact statement. And those impacts may last for 
a very long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Ms. Bear">In terms of what I have seen in the context of EIS 
preparation, yes, I have seen some delays that are unfortunate, 
and some problems that have been alluded to here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Ms. Bear">I have also seen some very positive developments. You 
mentioned the enthusiasm of private citizens, which I have 
found was the most gratifying part of my work. And one of the 
most exciting developments in NEPA over the past decade, 
decade-and-a-half, I think, is citizens who have come together 
in various coalitions, not just one group, but maybe ranchers, 
counties, small businesses, public interest groups, a variety 
of people, tribes, and developed a comprehensive alternative 
and presented it to the agency, and had that reviewed in the 
EIS, once in a while chosen, either in whole or in part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Ms. Bear">    To me, that is really democracy in action, where they are 
really contributing the alternatives to their agencies, to 
their government. So, that has been very gratifying, to see 
that development.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Tsongas</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">I thank you for that. One of the issues we
have had--I want to see how much time, oh, I don't have enough 
time to go through this. Thank you for your testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Ms. Tsongas">    Mr. Gohmert [presiding]. Thank you. At this time, the Chair 
recognizes the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Lamborn, for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lamborn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Mr. Lamborn">I want to thank the Chairman, first of all,
for having this hearing on such an important issue. NEPA is a 
policy that directly impacts an entire scope of this Committee, 
and that is why our Committee has primary jurisdiction over it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Mr. Lamborn">It should be obvious to any observer that, despite the good 
intentions behind the original passage of NEPA, it has now 
become, in many cases, nothing more than a weapon to stop or 
delay any kind of development, even development that is vital 
to creating jobs and giving us a higher standard of living. And 
when you look around the world and you see countries that have 
more prosperity, they have a better environment, they can 
afford to clean up the environment. I believe, if you want a 
clean environment, you should allow development to go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Mr. Lamborn">Mr. Howard and Mr. Bridges, one thing that we try to do in 
our legislation here, especially as we look forward to possible 
infrastructure legislation going forward, is to allow for lead 
agencies to be designated for NEPA review and requiring 
agencies to sit down and coordinate at the very beginning. 
Would either of those two things erode the integrity of NEPA in 
any way?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Mr. Lamborn">    Mr. Howard, or Mr. Bridges?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Mr. Howard"> No, no. Coordination among agencies is vital.
The problem has come up when the agencies have different 
agendas, which they do--Fish and Wildlife has a different 
agenda than the Corps of Engineers--and there is no effective 
means of resolving the disagreement. Those disagreements can 
last months or years. That is the problem. There are no clear 
lines of authority to resolve what are natural and honest 
differences in view.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lamborn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"> So, articulating and defining those areas of
agreement ahead of time, either by Congress or by the agencies, 
would be a positive development?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Mr. Howard"> Well, I think it is impossible to resolve a
disagreement ahead of time. I think you need to create clear 
lines of authority.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lamborn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"> Clear lines of authority, thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Mr. Howard"> To resolve disagreements.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lamborn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"> Mr. Bridges, in your testimony you mention a
project that has been tangled up in a seemingly never-ending 
NEPA review, the Millennium Bulk Terminals project in 
Washington State. Why was there such a Federal-State 
disconnect, first of all?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Mr. Bridges">I don't know why there is such a disconnect
there. I have been more involved with the state process. It has 
been going on for almost 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Just from an outsider looking at it, it seems to be, no 
matter which agency you are talking about, everybody is waiting 
for somebody else to be the first one to say yes. And that is 
kind of what I feel like, and you will see it in my written 
testimony, the people that oppose these projects have figured 
out the way to stall things and create a timeline that most 
businesses are not going to be able to survive and outlast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    It is so open-ended to try to put a timeline on it, that is 
really what we are looking for. We are not looking for de-
regulation or anything, just some type of predictable timeline 
for our communities and for the businesses that are trying to 
invest in our community.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lamborn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"> Thank you. Would having designated a lead
agency have expedited the project?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> I would think so, yes. I think there would be
less finger-pointing about whose turn it is to make a decision.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lamborn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Mr. Lamborn">Last, I would like to say that the original
intention of NEPA was to allow stakeholders to have a voice in 
the project. But I think sometimes that gets hijacked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Mr. Lamborn">    [Slide.]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lamborn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Mr. Lamborn">Up on the TV screen there are some photos that
are going to be shown. And this has to do with a public scoping 
meeting in Bangor, Maine for the then-proposed North Woods 
National Monument. But these were people that were bussed in, a 
2-hour bus ride from some distance away. They were not local 
business owners or even local residents, but they were calling 
themselves local opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Mr. Lamborn">    Mr. Bridges, have you ever seen cases of people being 
bussed in to provide so-called public comment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Yes, that is exactly what we have been
experiencing in my area with all the projects. We have three 
large projects, and they have a really good coalition, and they 
are just kind of moving around. And we see the same people, 
whether it is in Vancouver, Washington, Longview, Washington, 
and most of them are coming from the Puget Sound area, the 
Seattle area, or from Portland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Mr. Bridges">We do have a few local opposition folks, but you can 
usually count those on one or two hands, the regulars that show 
up. I think it does discourage the community from coming 
because it has gotten to be where either you have to put a blue 
shirt on or a red shirt on, and that is not what this process 
is supposed to be about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    But they made it a choice between jobs and environment, and 
I don't think that is really what we are looking at.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Lamborn</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Mr. Lamborn"> Thank you very much.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Thank you. At this time the Chair recognizes
Mr. Lowenthal from California for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Dr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. One of the greatest 
things about NEPA, in my opinion, is that it gives ordinary 
Americans a tool to weigh in on projects that can affect them, 
environmentally, economically, and culturally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">This is especially true for those communities that are 
highly impacted by projects. In my area of California, 
especially true for the low-income, which are frequently 
minority communities whose neighborhoods are the most affected 
by infrastructure projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">I think of all the areas that this Committee has under its 
jurisdiction, NEPA is the most important for my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">The district I represent includes what locals used to say 
all the time and now say less and less is the diesel death 
zone, which are those neighborhoods, primarily low-income and 
minority neighborhoods, that border the busiest port complex in 
the United States. These communities have above-average rates 
of asthma attacks, cancers, especially pulmonary cancers, and 
other health-related issues that are associated with air 
pollution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">But on the other hand, the economic activity of the Ports 
of Long Beach and Los Angeles generate a great deal of positive 
benefit for our community. There are thousands of jobs because 
the ports are there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">At the same time, there are serious health concerns, 
especially in the neighborhoods, as I pointed out, around the 
ports. For example, schools have to have filters, kids cannot 
go outside, unfortunately, on too many days when the air 
quality is bad during their recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">But even though the ports have made significant 
improvements in the environmental conditions in or around them, 
and I must compliment them, there is still much more that needs 
to be done. And the decisions that we are going to be making in 
this port complex and throughout the Nation on infrastructure 
matter a great deal to those communities that are affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">NEPA is the Federal tool in these communities in my 
district that they have for weighing in on any major project as 
it is being evaluated and finalized. Unfortunately, many of the 
reforms that we are discussing today would cut out these very 
important voices of my constituents, the ones that need NEPA 
the most, potentially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">So, I have a question, first, for Ms. Bear. Even the most 
economically beneficial projects, they can hurt the environment 
of nearby communities in the absence of clear public review, 
both public and Federal agencies. NEPA exists so we don't have 
to make those kinds of trade-offs, and instead can move toward 
sustainable economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">    During the NEPA review, when we have projects, such as one 
of the recent projects in the Port of Los Angeles, the Everport 
Project, where in the review, the EPA expressed concerns about 
the project's air quality and human health impacts, 
particularly on the low-income communities around it. In the 
final EIS, the Army Corps strengthened its air quality 
mitigation measures to specify that all the dredging equipment 
be electric. That really reduced the impact of the project's 
construction emissions, while still allowing the project to go 
forward. Is this what you mean by win-win situations, where we 
allow and have sustainable projects go forward, but we also 
protect communities?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Ms. Bear">Yes, very much so. And I would just add, I
alluded earlier that health, along with social and economic 
impacts, are one of the kinds of impacts that I think need to 
be given more attention in the NEPA process. I served on a 
National Academy panel looking at the role of public health 
issues in the NEPA process. There is a lot of work there to be 
done, and I am glad to hear that in the Los Angeles Port 
situation that worked, and worked well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Ms. Bear">    Dr. Lowenthal. And finally, finalizing on that, would such 
outcomes where we both had a sustainable development, would 
they be less likely if some of these proposals we are hearing 
today, like shortened review time frames, limits on scientific 
analysis, restricted public input--if they were adopted, would 
this negatively impact the ability to have this?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Ms. Bear">I can't answer. OK. I thought I was out of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Ms. Bear">In my view, it depends on which measure we are talking 
about and some caveats. Let me just explain. Certainly cutting 
back on scientific analysis, yes. Cutting back on public 
involvement, yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Ms. Bear">In terms of the time, there has been a lot of discussion 
and testimony about time and size of EISs. And there is no 
doubt that some of the length of time and the length of EISs, 
which are the smallest percentage of NEPA documents, is too 
long. And I would like to see that cut, and that would be 
consistent with CEQ's perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Ms. Bear">That is where I get to the point that, unfortunately, to do 
less in some ways, and certainly to do it faster, you need 
people. I think many of us went to school, heard our English 
teacher saying it takes longer to write a shorter document--
which is true, you need to do some editing, and you also need 
people, staff, that understand what the right issues are, or 
can even oversee consultants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. Bear">I remember, just to give you an example, if I have another 
second.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Ms. Bear">    Dr. Lowenthal. Real quickly, our time is limited.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> The time is expired.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Ms. Bear">I am sorry. OK, thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Ms. Bear">    Dr. Lowenthal. Thank you. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman, for your forbearance.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> Thank you. At this time, the Chair recognizes
the gentleman from California, Mr. McClintock, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Mr. McClintock">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. McClintock">    Mr. Bridges, is a cost benefit analysis done before NEPA is 
applied to a project? Does anybody ask how much is this going 
to cost and how much value can we expect it to add for the 
public?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> Yes. Usually that is done early on in the
process, from my experience.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. McClintock"> OK, and if the cost of the study exceeds
the value that can be expected from it, do we do the study 
anyway?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> Are you talking about the cost of the EIS?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. McClintock"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> Yes, I don't think that any of these projects
probably anticipated the cost of what the EIS would be after--
--
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. McClintock"> So, as far as the EIS is concerned, the sky
is the limit?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. McClintock">To what extent do these requirements
inflate the cost of projects?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. McClintock">For example, I have a community in my district, Foresthill. 
They get their water from the Sugar Pine Reservoir, a small 
reservoir that was built years ago with a dam with an 18-foot 
spillway, but no spillway gate. They didn't need the water at 
the time; they do now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. McClintock">    So, they went out and priced a spillway gate for this 
little community of about 5,000 people. The cost of the gate is 
$2 million. But then the cost of the environmental studies is 
expected to be over $1 million, and the environmental 
mitigation over $2 million. So, a $2 million project that was a 
heavy lift for this little community, but within reach, becomes 
a $5 million cost-prohibitive boondoggle. Is that typical of 
these projects?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> Yes, the scale that I am looking at from the
projects that I am talking about, they are sizable projects, $1 
billion, $2 billion projects. Some of the EISs I have seen are 
upwards of $14 million right now for the state.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. McClintock"> Often in multiples of what the actual cost
of the project is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. McClintock">With no consideration of the cost benefit
to be derived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. McClintock">    Mr. Howard, has anyone estimated the value of projects that 
are never initiated because of the anticipated cost of these 
NEPA requirements?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Howard">It is very hard to quantify what is not done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Howard">It is generally believed, in the infrastructure business, 
that private capital sits on the sidelines for the kinds of 
projects it would be appropriate for in the United States 
compared with, for example, Europe and the United Kingdom, 
because there is no certainty as to the timing of approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Howard">    And no, they don't do a cost benefit analysis before doing 
an EIS. It is all or nothing. In many projects, like the one 
you suggested, the absence of any common-sense decision making 
to do what the statute says, which is to balance the public 
needs versus environmental needs, is one of the deficiencies.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. McClintock"> Has anyone estimated the total cost to the
economy of these requirements? I think taxpayers deserve, in 
fact, everybody deserves, accurate price signals of what 
benefits we get and at what cost from all of our laws, but NEPA 
in particular.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Howard">If you simply look at the infrastructure that
needs to be remade, most of which does require environmental 
impact statements, it is not in these sort of trivial actions 
but the big ones, we are talking about multiple trillions of 
dollars over the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Howard">    We did an analysis that said if there is a 6-year delay, 
which is not caused only by NEPA, but also caused by multiple 
permitting requirements, that more than doubles the cost of 
that. So, if you had a $4 million infrastructure build over a 
decade, it would end up costing, in effect, including 
opportunity cost, twice as much.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. McClintock"> We are told, though, that just 1 percent of
projects require this full-scale environmental, so what is the 
problem?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Howard"> That is a very misleading number, because the
categorical exclusions typically apply to very minor things, 
like can we put a falcon's nest over at this part of the park. 
You have all these sorts of daily executive decisions that fall 
under the categorical exclusion.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. McClintock"> So, it is the 1 percent that are absolutely
killing us and imposing these costs, and impeding communities 
meeting the needs of their citizens.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Howard"> The 1 percent aligns with the American Society
of Civil Engineers report on the infrastructure needs.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. McClintock</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. McClintock">Mr. Willox, let me go to forest management
for a moment. We used to actively manage our forests to match 
tree density to the ability of the land to support them. This 
created a revenue stream to the Treasury for forest management 
and local governments, not to mention very healthy commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Mr. McClintock">NEPA has made forest management virtually impossible. We 
are told that NEPA is one of our landmark environmental laws, 
yet we are now, because of the requirements, carrying four 
times the tree density that the land can support in the Sierra 
Nevada, and the result is these trees are badly stressed, and 
they lose their natural resistance to drought, disease, 
pestilence, and fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. McClintock">    I think we are entitled to ask, after 45 years of 
experience with this law, with the promise it was going to 
improve our forest environment, how is the forest environment 
doing?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Willox"> It is clear that the diseased and insect-
infested trees are a fire danger. And if you have ever read 
about a forest fire in the West, the smoke and carbon released 
in that fire is way more detrimental than reasonable logging 
and harvesting of that lumber would be.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired.
At this time the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, 
Mr. Soto, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Soto">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am excited that we are
talking about infrastructure. I worry, with the proposed tax 
reform that will add $2.3 trillion to the debt, we may not have 
any money for it. But let's assume for a second that we have an 
ability to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Soto">    First, Ms. Bear, what do you think an appropriate staff 
number would be for NEPA review?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Ms. Bear"> I am sorry----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Soto"> You had mentioned that there is not enough staff
to review these NEPA claims.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Soto"> What would be an appropriate number to make sure
we could speed these things up within appropriate reason?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Ms. Bear"> For the entire Federal executive branch?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Soto"> Let's just focus on this one area, shall we?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Infrastructure? OK, but that infrastructure
involves a number of agencies, of course, the Department of 
Transportation, the Army Corps of Engineers, and a lot of other 
agencies. I would really like to get back to you on the record 
in terms of a number for infrastructure.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Soto"> I think it is important, if you think there is a
certain appropriate number, we would love to hear about it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Sure, OK.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Soto"> Let me go to the next question then. What would
happen if NEPA was eliminated, Ms. Bear? What would be the 
consequences?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Ms. Bear">I think, first of all, a lot of people would be
very surprised. A lot of private citizens in the United States 
would be surprised much more than they realize now by things 
that were happening that they didn't know were going to happen 
in advance. And I say that because I think today many people 
take for granted, particularly people that live near public 
lands and use them, or in urban areas where there is 
infrastructure, that if something is going to happen of some 
import to them, they will know about it in advance. And if you 
take NEPA away, most of the time that is not necessarily true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Ms. Bear">There are exceptions to that, there are other laws that 
require some sort of public notice or involvement. But NEPA is, 
by far, the broadest and most systematic of those laws, so that 
is issue Number one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Ms. Bear">    Issue Number two, I think, while the agencies would 
probably continue to try to mitigate some of the most important 
adverse impacts, I think you would lose the alternatives 
analysis, which is really the heart of the NEPA process. It is 
what forces people to think outside of their own little box, 
into thinking about better ways to accomplish what we are 
trying to achieve in a particular context.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Soto"> So, it is more comprehensive and provides
alternatives?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. Soto">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Soto">    Mr. Bridges, thank you for coming. We don't want to have 
NEPA get in the way of opportunities, obviously, particularly 
for our building trades and our working families. What do you 
think the time limit should be for a review? Because you 
mentioned that some of them are going too long.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> Yes. We talk about 2 years as a fair timeline.
I know there are so many different processes and different 
agencies that are in there, but that seems like a fair 
timeline, and have some predictability there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Soto">OK. Mr. Howard, you had mentioned that there are
some de minimis things that are required. You mentioned the 
Bayonne Bridge and a traffic study. What do you think should be 
the mechanism, if we are talking about something that is de 
minimis, in your opinion?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Soto">    Then you also mentioned balance with cost benefit analysis. 
What are you advising us should be the rule on these sorts of 
potentially de minimis issues and striking this balance?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Howard">I think the way the process should work is that
there should be incentive for project developers to engage the 
public before the environmental impact statement, so it is not 
fully baked by the time it gets to a public hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Howard">Then, I think that the environmental officials in charge of 
environmental review, and I agree with beefing up the staff, I 
think it is very important, should have the authority, if there 
is a dispute over the scope of review for a project, to make 
decisions. We elect people, they appoint people. You need to 
make a decision about how much review is needed for the Bayonne 
Bridge or for the tunnel. The tunnel has a significant 
environmental impact, but not doing the tunnel immediately has 
an incredibly catastrophic environmental impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Howard">    So, someone in the Administration has to be authorized to 
say, however we build this tunnel, it is better to get it 
started tomorrow than to get it started in 5 years. Someone 
needs to have that job.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Soto"> So, a preliminary hearing on scope, or a meeting
among the developers and the government would be helpful, you 
think?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Mr. Howard"> Well, that would be helpful, and also engaging
the public. But most important is having the Chair of CEQ or 
having CEQ have the authority to make these kinds of balancing 
decisions, whereas now, in part because of the fear of 
litigation, the presumption is no pebble left unturned. So, it 
ends up just taking much longer than it ought to take. Most 
reviews should take a year or less, even big ones.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Soto</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Soto"> I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> Thank you. The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Alaska.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Young"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> He has 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Young">I think this is a very important hearing. NEPA
itself was never intended to be an obstructionist part of our 
infrastructure, nor building of any other thing. But it has 
been used as that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Mr. Young">I will give you an example of Alaska's national forest, the 
Tongass, one of the largest forests in America, in fact, it is. 
A small portion of the Tongass is managed by the state. The 
vast majority is by the Federal Government, who does not manage 
it. It takes less than 18 months for the state to plan and 
offer a timber sale in Tongass. At the same time, the Forest 
Service sales are delayed by 5 years, largely because of NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Young">And you look at NEPA and here is one thing, gentlemen on 
this Committee, whether you want to eliminate it, I don't think 
we can, but we ought to at least take and streamline it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Mr. Young">There are 90 statutes that govern the management of the 
Forest Service, 90 statutes, which are not connected or working 
together as we go through this and, consequently, have bad 
forest management in not only the Tongass, but other parts of 
the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Young">In the 35 years I have served on this Committee, we have 
had two pulp mills, five large saw mills, and many smaller 
mills that have been forced to shut down because of the lack of 
timber because of the inefficiency of the Forest Service. We 
have lost 5,000 family wage jobs in this area that used to take 
and support small communities that no longer exist. Some people 
like that, but NEPA should not be used to slow down and impede 
the development because it does not protect the environment. 
And that is really what we should be talking about. I think we 
ought to recognize that as a Committee, that the environment is 
not protected by this law. In fact, it increases the problems 
we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Mr. Young">I noticed someone in their testimony talking about when we 
slow down traffic congestion, that adds more to the environment 
degradation than we do ordinarily because of NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Young">And, by the way, we are the only country in the world that 
can spend money as we are spending it to achieve nothing. We 
are spending money, this is as bad as some of the wars we have 
had. We do not achieve anything in this effort, because we 
don't really address the environment. We don't take into 
consideration the impact upon communities, the individual jobs. 
The prosperity of this Nation is being held up because of this 
law. It does need to be improved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Mr. Young">Mr. Howard, in your written testimony, you talk about labor 
groups and delay tactics. But when a project's applicant and 
labor groups are on the same page, isn't that something that 
should be looked at as a positive for NEPA review?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Young">    When these groups are on the same page and we still see 
delays, why? And what does it accomplish?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Howard">There are many projects that everyone agrees
ought to go forward, and labor is arm and arm with the National 
Association of Manufacturers and the regional plant 
associations and such, and it still takes years, unnecessarily. 
So, your point is extremely well taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Mr. Howard">    But I go back to the point that if you don't have a 
decision maker whose job it is to balance, you have this 
utopian assumption that every project gets full review, even 
though everybody knows that the right thing to do is to go 
clear out this part of the forest. And society doesn't work 
without people using judgment. We cannot create automatic 
government and utopian solutions. Unfortunately, NEPA has 
evolved into that delay for no good purpose.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Young"> As a member of the Transportation Committee and
the chairman at one time, we were replacing a bridge because 
the old bridge was wore out. And we had to have a NEPA review 
on the fish activity on the new bridge. The new bridge was 24 
feet from the old bridge. Now that is stupidity beyond any 
stupidity action you can possibly have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Mr. Howard"> Oh, I can----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Mr. Young">It held up the project for 4 years, because we
were studying the fish that went underneath the old bridge all 
those years. Now we build a new bridge, we had to have this 
NEPA study. That is stupidity. And yet this Nation allows that 
to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Young">We have to change this law so it has more sense, so we have 
quicker decisions, we don't have all the statutes, we don't 
have all the agencies that are involved, so that projects are 
held up forever and ever and ever, and which cost more money 
and hurts the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Mr. Young">Anybody disagree with that at that table? Anybody disagree 
with that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Young">    An old bridge and a new bridge, what was right with that, 
or why was it necessary to have it done? That was under your 
watch, by the way.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Congressman Young, that is not a specific issue I
was involved in, I cannot speak to that bridge. But to the 
extent that the issue is bridge replacement, I would like to 
give you an example of where NEPA did make a positive 
difference on a community related to a bridge replacement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Young"> Did it make a difference on the fish?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Ms. Bear"> On the case I was going to mention, the fish were
not the issue I was aware of. It was an issue affecting the 
community and businesses in the community.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Young"> I was speaking about, and I think you ought to
consider it, that is what held up that bridge for 5 years, or 4 
years.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Ms. Bear"> OK.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Young</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Young">That is the stupidity of this Act. Mr. Chairman,
thank you. Because if we don't change this Act, we don't have 
the money to continue how it is being implemented by mostly 
easterners, by the way, and I am a westerner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Young">    [Laughter.]
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> All right, thank you. The Chair recognizes the
gentleman from California for 5 minutes, Mr. Huffman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Huffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Huffman">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wish we did spend
more time talking about how these laws are being implemented, 
and how we can make them work better, instead of constantly 
scapegoating the laws themselves, and the policies behind them. 
And I am disappointed that today's hearing seems to have been 
set up for us to simply talk past each other to try to box the 
Democratic side of the aisle in as those who are the defenders 
of delay and bureaucracy, and the Republican side as those who 
want to see major projects happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Huffman">If we could stop talking past each other, for example, my 
colleague from Colorado literally said NEPA has become nothing 
more than a weapon to stop projects. I would like to have a 
conversation about that, because I think he knows that is not 
true. He knows that NEPA, in 98 percent, 99 percent of 
projects, is not a source of significant delay at all. There is 
no challenge, these projects are moving forward. You are simply 
requiring public notice, public input, and an alternative 
consideration, which is, frankly, a way to make for better 
projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Huffman">It was said earlier, very casually, that NEPA was blamed 
for a small spillway gate project at Sugar Pine Reservoir in 
California, a project that is not even owned by the Federal 
Government. There is probably a NEPA review somewhere in the 
course of the many permits and reviews necessary to raise that 
spillway gate. But I would like to talk to my friend, Mr. 
McClintock, a little more about that project, because I am 
willing to bet, dollars to doughnuts, that NEPA is not the 
reason the review process and the planning process for that 
project cost more than the construction of that project. And to 
suggest, as the colloquy between the Member and the witness 
did, that it is somehow typical for the NEPA cost to exceed the 
project cost, we are now drifting into the realm of hyperbole, 
scapegoating, and factual distortion that just prevents smart 
policy making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Huffman">So, I would love to get back to the real world and the real 
facts. Ms. Bear, I would like to ask you about one of the 
claims that was made to again trivialize this idea of public 
input. It was suggested that for an offshore wind project, 
lawsuits were about protecting ocean views. In reality, my 
understanding is that opponents argued that stakeholders, 
including fishermen, were simply not adequately consulted, and 
that alternatives were not identified. These are key components 
to the NEPA process: consult people who are impacted, consider 
alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Huffman">    Can litigation actually argue against a project's design?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Ms. Bear">No, that would not be a kind of claim that would
be brought under NEPA, in terms of the design. There might be a 
claim associated with failure to look at some sort of 
reasonable alternative to that design, but the courts don't 
weigh in on the goodness or badness, so to speak, of the design 
or the project itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Ms. Bear">    The point of NEPA litigation is whether or not an agency 
followed the procedural requirements of NEPA.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Huffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Mr. Huffman">All right. And what about the importance of
this public input? There has been an effort to trivialize 
public input, to suggest that it is a circus, that people dress 
up in costumes, and that that is what public input under the 
NEPA process is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Huffman">I can't help but think that right now they are cleaning up 
an oil spill in part of the Keystone Pipeline, and I wonder if 
maybe they should not have listened to the people that came to 
public meetings dressed up as fish and in tribal outfits and 
raising their posters high, instead of just listening to the 
oil executives who are now hiding under their desks and never 
seem to be around when things go wrong. Maybe we need to be 
more careful and have more public input for some of these big, 
polluting projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Mr. Huffman">    But why do we value public input in this process?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Ms. Bear">Because it matters, and because we are a
democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Ms. Bear">    I have seen a number of situations, I am not going to sit 
here and say every single one, but I have seen decisions 
fundamentally change through public involvement, and that 
matters. It matters a whole lot to the citizens to know that 
they have actually played a role in government decision making. 
And it has improved the environment.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Huffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Mr. Huffman"> Well, I am not claiming that NEPA is perfect,
nobody is claiming it is being implemented perfectly. But do 
you have any thoughts to close out my time on how we could make 
NEPA faster, more efficient, more effective, without gutting 
the important purposes?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Ms. Bear">I think it is critical to focus on
implementation. And I don't have much time left, but I will 
just take one of several examples here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Ms. Bear">Mr. Howard has spoken about the 6-month delay in choosing a 
lead agency for the Bayonne Bridge. I understand why that would 
be frustrating. There is a process in the CEQ regulation, a 65-
day max to determine the lead agency. Anyone can trigger that 
process, and there are many other examples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Ms. Bear">    I am out of time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Huffman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Mr. Huffman"> OK, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> This time the Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Mexico, Mr. Pearce, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Mr. Pearce">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It was interesting to
hear my friend talking about hyperbole coming from our side, 
and in the next breath talk about oil execs hiding under their 
desks. That appears to be maybe just a little bit over the top, 
itself. But I appreciate the gentleman's observations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Mr. Pearce">Mr. Willox, this whole idea that somehow we are overblowing 
the effects that you face on the ground, I hear from county 
commissioners, I represent a 34 percent Republican district, so 
most of the counties' elected officials are Democrats. I hear 
from them equally as much as Republicans that there are bad 
effects coming from the NEPA process that affect their forests 
and the jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Mr. Pearce">    So, tell me, from your perspective, is the process only 1 
percent of the time destructive? Is it more destructive? I 
don't know. Tell me from a county commissioner point of view.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Mr. Willox">Well, I think it is important to distinguish
between the big projects and the little projects. This is the 
draft EIS for a big project, our Converse County oil and gas 
one. We have a checkerboard ownership, minor Federal surface.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Mr. Willox">And I talked earlier, the Federal nexus is a mile away from 
the disturbance. Why should that private land be encumbered by 
the NEPA process because we are touching Federal minerals a 
mile away? This law was written before horizontal access to 
minerals, so I think that is a bad decision when we impact 
private landowners and their surface that they own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Mr. Willox">    The other examples are on minor projects. I talk about a 
power line in our area--you will see power lines that literally 
take two 90-degree angles, or three, to go around Federal 
surface so they don't have to go through the process and the 
cost of the shortest, most reasonable route that would have the 
least impact on the environment. So, the negative consequence 
of following that process is we build a longer power line with 
more disturbance that costs more. Absolutely against the goals 
of making positive decisions for the environment, and informed 
decisions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> You are just mentioning the 1 percent, so 99
percent is OK?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Mr. Willox"> No, the----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> OK, I just wanted to clarify.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Mr. Willox"> To be clear, the power lines are in that 99
percent, because it falls under those small----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Mr. Pearce"> I am just razzing you, thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Mr. Willox"> Yes, thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Mr. Pearce">I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Mr. Pearce">Mr. Bridges, you heard Ms. Bear say that one of the great 
benefits of NEPA, I think it was in response to the question if 
there was no NEPA, that people would be surprised by the things 
that are happening, that it is important to know in advance. 
How many projects do you think your association would move 
forward without notifying people that it is going on?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Mr. Pearce">    In other words, I am trying to evaluate the validity of the 
comment that was made by a fellow panelist. Do you keep things 
kind of secret, and the only reason you bring them up is 
because of the NEPA process?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Bridges">No, I don't think it would be secret. But I
also agree that we have heard some great examples from Ms. Bear 
and others about collaborative things that happen and things 
that get put into projects, mitigation and things that may not 
have happened. And those are good things. I just have not had 
that personal experience during the hearing processes with 
that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    We have had success in working with the private investors 
that are wanting to spend the money in our state.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Pearce">OK. All right, I need to keep rolling. Mr.
Howard, the same question. Do you keep things silent, hidden 
below the dark, and they only surface because of NEPA?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Pearce">    And I need a quick answer on that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Howard">No one in modern America would be smart to do
that. I come at this as a civic leader, so I am used to really 
dumb decisions by public officials on projects that make no 
sense, and opposing them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Howard">I do think that NEPA is important, and I think the public 
role ought to be beefed up, not cut down. As I said earlier, it 
should be done earlier in the process, you really get 
meaningful feedback, rather than after you have a 1,000 or 
10,000-page environmental impact statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Public input is important. What is not important are 
academic studies and bickering over whether you disclosed 
something accurately in page 556.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Pearce">All right. I have another question I need to
ask here. I get the idea, and I appreciate your input. Sorry to 
rush along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Pearce">    Mr. Willox, what is the effect on the schools when we kill 
the jobs in these rural areas? I suspect Wyoming has some areas 
much like my district, very massive rural areas. The only jobs 
used to be keeping our forests clean. Now we are burning our 
forests down, but it doesn't take any jobs to do that. So, what 
is the effect on our schools when we don't have these clean-up 
projects in our forests?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Willox">Well, you are absolutely right. The local
economies are hurt any time we lose jobs for any reason. And 
forestry was a big part of parts of Wyoming. Some of those have 
converted to firefighters, which is a very unfortunate 
transition, from timber to firefighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Willox">    So, not just the schools, but the community and all that is 
part of that community is hurt any time jobs are lost for 
reasons that seem to be out of the control of the locals, and 
seem to not be in the best interests of the local socio-
economic environment.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Pearce</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. Pearce">OK, thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Mr. Pearce">    I yield back, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> Thank you. At this time the Chair----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"> Ms. Barragan and then----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> OK, the Chair recognizes the gentlelady from
California, Ms. Barragan.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to follow
up on this. It seems like we are hearing a lot of complaints 
about NEPA, horror stories about the Act holding up economic 
development. Some of my colleagues have said it is not true. I 
am one of those, that it is less than 1 percent of instances 
where NEPA causes these delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Ms. Barragan">We just had one of my colleagues question Mr. Willox about 
what is happening in his county, and whether it is actually 
less than 1 percent. And I just want to remind everybody that 
the actual figure we are using is coming from a report that is 
being cited not just by our side of the aisle, but the other 
side of the aisle. It is a 2014 U.S. Government Accountability 
Office report. So, I would much rather focus on what we are all 
relying upon than just one select county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    Ms. Bear, I wanted to give you an opportunity. You had 
started to give an answer about some of the implementation 
suggestions you had. Did you want more time to complete that 
response?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Ms. Bear">I appreciate that. One of these days I will learn
to hit the button. Apparently I am a slow learner on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Ms. Bear">Anyway, yes, I do appreciate that opportunity. I wanted to 
make several observations about issues that have been brought 
up in the testimony that I am very sympathetic to, but that 
really run to the point of implementation issues because of 
either lack of staff or, frankly, staff that have not been 
given appropriate training to do their jobs. I have met some 
staff people who have been given NEPA assignments and, frankly, 
don't know anything about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Ms. Bear">I already mentioned very briefly, Mr. Howard has used the 
example of the 6-month dispute over a lead agency there, and 
also the need for a decision maker. There is a dispute 
resolution process specifically geared toward CEQ making a 
final decision in the case of a dispute over a lead agency and 
affected parties. Mr. Howard could have brought it, anybody 
could bring that in to CEQ, and CEQ has 20 days to make that 
decision, and it is a final decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Ms. Bear">Mr. Bridges pointed out the difficulty and frustration of 
having two separate environmental impact statements done: the 
Federal EIS, and I think, I could be wrong, a 13,000-page state 
EIS. That is horrifying. And it is one of the things that I 
found saddest when I was trying to do oversight for many years, 
as the only person overseeing 85 agencies. That never should 
have happened, unless there was some very extraordinary 
circumstance. That should have been a joint EIS. The agencies 
should have done it together to fulfill both the state and 
Federal requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Ms. Bear">The ID teams, the early involvement and ID teams that Mr. 
Willox mentioned, absolutely. The county and the state, if it 
is appropriate, the tribe, and the tribal government, if there 
is one involved, should all be at the table, should be part of 
the ID team, and should be making major contributions about 
areas that they are very familiar with, including the social 
and economic structure of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Ms. Bear">    There are many more examples, but I just wanted to pick 
some that were relevant here. All of those are already 
addressed in the CEQ regulations, or CEQ guidance. Clearly, 
they are not being perfectly implemented. And we are never 
going to get to perfection, but I think we could do a heck of a 
lot better, in terms of implementing it, with adequate 
capacity.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Great, thank you. When I looked into this, I
reached out to my own area in Los Angeles and heard success 
stories. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority's Crenshaw/LAX transit corridor project was one of 
the Federal Transit Administration's first projects piloting a 
new NEPA process that helped identify and mitigate project 
risks more efficiently through the project review process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Ms. Barragan">The Transportation Authority determined that a 5-mile 
stretch of the project could actually utilize a rarely used 
existing freight rail line corridor, instead of building new 
tracks in that section. The railroad agreed to abandon the line 
and allow the Authority to use it. That decision decreased 
project cost, saved time, and reduced disturbances for a nearby 
community by using an existing right-of-way, while providing 
significant environmental benefits, economic development, and 
employment opportunities throughout Los Angeles County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    Ms. Bear, is this the kind of outcome that NEPA was created 
to produce?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Absolutely, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Thank you. At this time, the Chair recognizes
Dr. Gosar from Arizona for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Dr. Gosar. I thank the Chair. Mr. Chairman, I just heard a 
conversation from my colleague from California about talking 
past ourselves and bringing up issues. It has been noted that 
the Minority witness is one of the chief litigants from one of 
the major litigation groups in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">I have this document, it says donate here, the name is 
right on the front, here are over 500 litigations from the 
Defenders of Wildlife, right here. I find that kind of 
interesting, that when we are talking about solutions, that we 
would bring a headhunter like we have right here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Number two, we might be a form of democracy, but we are a 
representative republic. And I caution everybody to make sure 
you understand that. It is a higher degree in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">    Mr. Howard, in your written testimony, you mention that 
former EPA General Counsel E. Donald Elliott estimates that 90 
percent of detail in Federal impact statements is there not 
because it is actually useful to the public or decision makers, 
but because it might help in the inevitable litigation--a form 
of environmental ``defensive medicine.'' Has the original 
purpose of the NEPA been lost in its quest to have the most 
litigation-proof NEPA environmental review?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Howard">The original purpose has been undermined by
this form of implementation that really makes it inaccessible 
to the public and not practical for reasonable decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Dr. Gosar. So, how has the NEPA litigation shifted the 
balance of power of who is ultimately in charge of permitting 
projects and held accountable for those decisions?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Howard">The litigation over NEPA in many cases shifts
power to opponents who can then use it to achieve--sometimes 
these benefits may be in the public good, and sometimes they 
are for the good of the group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Howard">So, for example, in the Bayonne Bridge, the group funding 
the litigation against the environmental impact statement was 
the union for the Port Authority, which wanted to use the 
litigation as the lever to get the port to agree to be a closed 
union shop. They were using the NEPA litigation as a lever to 
get something that had nothing to do with the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Dr. Gosar. So, the fact that I brought up these 500 
litigations actually has a big influence upon that process, 
does it not?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Mr. Howard">It does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Howard">Dr. Gosar. Interesting. So, Mr. Willox and Mr. Bridges--
first, Mr. Willox. There are some who would argue that because 
the number of projects that require an environmental impact 
statement is small compared to the overall number of projects 
reviewed, that reform is not necessary. The assumption here is 
that companies pursue projects without considering the 
realities of navigating the NEPA process. We know that is not 
true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Can we actually quantify the number of projects that are 
never initiated due to the lack of confidence in the efficiency 
of the Federal approval process? Mr. Willox first.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Mr. Willox">Unfortunately, I cannot quantify that for you,
but it is a daunting task. We are 4 years into an oil and gas 
project in Converse County. The environment for oil and gas 
development is entirely different than when they started the 
project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Mr. Willox">So, for private companies to try to forecast and work 
through a process like this, and not know what their business 
environment is going to be like at the end of it, is for some 
an unreasonable risk to take, so they look for avenues that may 
avoid that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Willox">    Dr. Gosar. So, it is like moving the goalpost?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Mr. Willox">The goalpost is always moving. Then you throw
14 referees in the middle of it, it makes it a little hard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Willox">Dr. Gosar. And then you have this in the background, any 
little thing may be sued upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Mr. Willox">    Mr. Bridges, your opinion?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Bridges">I would agree with Mr. Willox on that. Just
from my personal experience, the goalpost continues to move and 
evolve. And that is all we are really looking for, 
predictability. And I think that is what business is looking 
for. When you have a project that you want to get built, and 
you have the community and business behind it, some reasonable 
timelines would be great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    Dr. Gosar. So, the two of you, have you ever encountered or 
observed a situation where, prior to initiating a new project, 
you have seen a threat of an extensive NEPA play a final impact 
on the final review, or going forward with that project? Have 
you seen a project like that, Mr. Willox?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Willox">I have not seen one specifically. Anecdotally,
I have heard it, but not in our area. But I could visit with 
more colleagues in our area to find out if people have said no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Willox">But it also affects government projects. If we want to do 
something, if local government wants it, we can trigger that. 
And there are times that that cost or implementation is 
definitely a consideration at the local level, whether to move 
forward with a road improvement project or something like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Willox">    Dr. Gosar. I think everybody should acknowledge that it is 
not just about being no or about being yes, but how do you do 
it right?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Willox">Correct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Willox">Dr. Gosar. And that is the key here. Instead of just saying 
no, no, no, no, no, it should be about what is it going to take 
to be yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Willox">    Thank you, and I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> Thank you. This time the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from California, Mr. Costa, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Costa">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Ranking
Member, for holding this hearing today, and having the 
opportunity to review how we might improve the National 
Environmental Policy Act, otherwise referred to as NEPA, that 
was first implemented when President Nixon, on January 1, 1970, 
signed it into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Mr. Costa">Having sat through more of these hearings than I care to 
recount, I guess I kind of have an idea on how this one is 
going. My colleagues across the dais will talk about delays 
that have occurred as a result of NEPA for a host of reasons, 
like permitting under other laws. Of course, we do, as the 
witnesses have testified to, have that complicating factor of 
state and local laws that are done in conjunction with, but are 
not actually required by the environmental impact review 
process under NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Costa">Most reasonable people, I think, would agree that some of 
the delays are caused by an abuse of the National Environmental 
Policy Act by stakeholders who want to delay or even stop a 
project to extract concessions or some resulting legitimate 
debate about reasonable alternatives that the Federal 
Government might pursue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Mr. Costa">Some of my colleagues on this side of the dais will say 
that NEPA is not the real cause of these delays, and that our 
Republican colleagues are simply trying to weaken or eliminate 
environmental laws. I have said a number of times, there is 
truth in both observations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Mr. Costa">But relating anecdotal stories doesn't count all the 
changes that have occurred since 1970 in what clearly is a much 
more litigious society that we live in today than back in the 
1970s and the 1980s, and I think we need to get past it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Mr. Costa">In 2015, in a transportation bill, we did amend NEPA to, I 
think, provide a better way in which we can process this 
effort. But at the end of the day, working together with 
Republicans and Democrats is the only way we are going to 
improve the environmental review process under NEPA, and to 
increase responsible public agencies, and also to ensure the 
right projects are built at the right scale in the right areas 
in a timely manner. And the timely manner gets to the point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Mr. Costa">I will give you an anecdotal story. In 2011, some of my 
colleagues were in the state legislature. I had been there up 
until 2002 for many years. We waived a portion of the state 
equivalent under CEQA for a football stadium. We know a lot of 
these things deal with not only public policy, but the politics 
on a host of these projects. It was determined in the public 
interest that this stadium was very important. So, we limited 
the time for judicial review, and we waived the period to deal 
with the superior court, so that if there was a suit brought 
forth, it would have to go to the appellate court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Mr. Costa">I don't know if that was good public policy or not. But the 
point is that, for reasons that we thought were meritorious, be 
they political or otherwise, we changed the law. OK?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Mr. Costa">So, nothing is perfect. Nothing is set in stone. I think 
the Congress was designed to function and to provide oversight 
and review, and a lot has changed since 1970. And I think it is 
appropriate, and I would like to see changes in NEPA, that we 
would try to figure out how we chart a course to pursue good 
public policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Mr. Costa">Ms. Bear, I was taken by your comments, because I think 
whether we are Republicans or Democrats, rich or poor, the 
economy and the environment, everyone has a stake in ensuring 
that good public policy is pursued, that we do not delay and 
have sort of tactics that really deal with people who don't 
want a project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Mr. Costa">    But you talked about some observations you had, joint EISs, 
having multi-agencies work together. What reforms would you 
recommend, with your experience working with Democrats and 
Republicans, and you are involved with CEQ, on how we could 
make a better mousetrap, for lack of a better term?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Ms. Bear">There are a number of provisions in the CEQ
regulations that were specifically designed to reduce delay. 
Many of those are not getting implemented on a regular basis. 
And I would like to see some serious oversight on why those are 
not getting implemented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Ms. Bear">In terms of changes to the statute, I don't think that is 
necessary to expedite the process. I really do think most of 
this is implementation issues. There are other reasons for 
delays, of course, besides NEPA that get caught up in the NEPA 
process, including compliance with other laws, funding 
proponents, changing plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Ms. Bear">    In California, which is also my home state, there is a 
provision, as I understand it, in CEQA that allows the state to 
essentially use the Federal EIS; although sometimes, for other 
reasons, California does do joint documents. But certainly 
better coordination between the state governments and the 
Federal agencies is a big part of what could be improved.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Mr. Costa"> Can you supplement a state law for a Federal
law, if it exceeds the requirements?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Ms. Bear">There is a pilot project essentially right now
under the FAST Act for that. And CEQ has recently published for 
public review and comment criteria that would define that. So, 
we will see how that works. That already is part of the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Ms. Bear">    Some states like California certainly have capacity for 
that, and a lot of experience under CEQA. The majority of 
states don't have a ``little NEPA law'' like California and New 
York City and New York does, so I think that would be much 
harder for the states.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Mr. Gohmert"> Your time has expired.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Costa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Mr. Costa"> Thank you. You might want to provide the
Committee with maybe some subsequent information that might be 
helpful.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Sure, happy to supply more for the record.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Gohmert</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Thank you. At this time, the Chair recognizes
Mr. Tipton for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Oh, I am sorry. I recognize Mr. Hice for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">Dr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Gohmert">    Mr. Howard, is it fair to say that the NEPA review process 
is very costly, as a general rule?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Mr. Howard">Yes. For large projects, many millions of
dollars, not counting the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Dr. Hice. And with that, obviously, it is also time 
consuming.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Mr. Howard">Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Dr. Hice. Many of you have mentioned that, in essence, this 
becomes a magnet for litigation, would you agree?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Mr. Howard">For many large projects, yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Mr. Howard">Dr. Hice. It is just set up for that. Others of you agree, 
basically, with this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Mr. Bridges, you mentioned earlier about many people coming 
from, and others did as well, not the local area, but from 
extended areas, particularly for the Millennium Bulk Terminal 
project. In the process of those individuals coming, would you 
say that at least portions of the project were hijacked by 
those individuals for their political agenda, whatever that may 
have been?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Mr. Bridges">That is what it seemed like to us. It seemed
to be more based on the particular commodity or whatever, 
instead of actually looking at using the process to look at how 
it really impacts the state and the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Dr. Hice. That is the impression I got, that is why I am 
using that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    Mr. Willox, would you say as well that that is frequently a 
reality?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Mr. Willox">It definitely exists. I don't know if it is
frequently, but there definitely is some of that. We had 
comments come from Germany and Europe on prairie dogs in 
northern Converse County that the agency must consider and look 
at. That seems to be a time sink to me, that the agency's time 
could be better spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Mr. Willox">We talked about staffing. Why review comments from foreign 
countries on prairie dogs? It seems not the best use of 
resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Willox">Dr. Hice. Not exactly local. All right, so GAO has said we 
are looking at an average of 4\1/2\ years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Mr. Willox">    Mr. Howard, I think you said 4.6, is that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Howard">That is correct, yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Dr. Hice. All right, so this is, in any way you look at it, 
a cumbersome process, not exactly the intent of Congress 
originally in 1970.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Mr. Howard">Early environmental impact statements were
dozens of pages long. And the regs say that even in the largest 
projects they should never be more than 300 pages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Dr. Hice. Would you say that your view is that public 
comment ought to come earlier in the process? With them coming 
as they currently are, is that detrimental?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Mr. Howard">Yes. I think there should be informal and
perhaps some formal public process before the environmental 
review is done to talk about the project, and get the public's 
concerns. It is really important to get public input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Mr. Howard">After the project is done and you have a multi-thousand-
page report, you end up having this thing that often does 
resemble a circus, and people are just justifying their 
decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Dr. Hice. And having public opinion at that point creates 
more problems?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Mr. Howard">It creates many problems. Sometimes some good
comes of it, but not nearly as much as if you do it earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Dr. Hice. All right. Mr. Bridges, with you, on the public 
input part of things, your experience in both observing and 
participating in all this, what have you observed with the 
public input?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Well, I think I mentioned this earlier. It
seemed to be that, because of the way the process works, people 
get involved later on after the draft EIS is out, and it is so 
publicized, it is in the paper, it is advertised. It allows 
these groups, the coalitions, to get together. And, I think, it 
prohibits the people in the public that really want to 
participate, because they do not want to have to pick a side. 
They want to go and do what Ms. Bear talked about, and talk 
about what they want to see in mitigation, or their real 
concerns, not be part of the sideshow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    Dr. Hice. So, again, your experience right now, the public 
input part as it currently exists, is it detrimental to the 
overall project?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Mr. Bridges">I think so, yes. It just adds drama that does
not need to be there, instead of dealing with the real facts of 
the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    Dr. Hice. All right, with the Millennial Bulk Terminal 
project, for example, how is the public input part being 
detrimental?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Mr. Bridges">I guess because there really is not any
limitation, it discourages people that would participate to 
stay on the sidelines, and it just leaves it to the proponents 
and the people that are fighting. So, there does not seem to be 
a middle ground of like what Ms. Bear was describing in some of 
the transportation projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Mr. Bridges">That is where I would like to see things, where we are 
working together to try to get this stuff done. But right now 
it is----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    Dr. Hice. I will yield back. But you say it is detrimental 
to the project itself, as well. I just want clarification.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Mr. Bridges">Dr. Hice. OK, yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Mr. Bridges">    Mr. Westerman [presiding]. The gentleman's time has 
expired. The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member, Mr. 
Grijalva, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank
you, Ms. Bear, for being with us. Good to see you again. And 
your expertise on this, on NEPA, is one of the best in this 
country, and we appreciate that and your advocacy on a variety 
of issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">But let's talk a little bit about a comment that my 
colleague, Mr. Huffman, made about our side of the aisle here 
just defending the status quo of NEPA, and not acknowledging 
anything else in there. Part of the status quo has been, from 
2011 until now, less resources, less training for staff, less 
staff. And you kind of build this self-fulfilling prophecy 
around NEPA, that because NEPA is taking so long, that there 
must be other, more dramatic efforts that need to be undertaken 
to reform NEPA, such as eliminating it, constricting it, and 
putting mandates on it that effectively will kill the public 
input that is the whole point of NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">I find it curious in some of the comments that by inviting 
public input we somehow limit other public input. I do not 
understand the logic of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">Could you talk a little bit about resources in the agency? 
You already mentioned the training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">    But also, when projects are delayed, there are also delays 
associated with the lack of funding and adequate funding for 
that particular project to go forward, and somehow NEPA ends up 
getting blamed for that. And the remedies that already exist 
within NEPA to deal with some of the issues that have been 
brought up by my colleagues in the Majority, if you wouldn't 
mind.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Ms. Bear">Right. And I think I already mentioned some of
those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Ms. Bear">Just at the beginning, if you don't mind, I want to take 1 
second to say that I am appearing here in my own capacity. I 
just want that on the record, as former General Counsel, not 
representing any organization, although I am very proud to be a 
member of Defenders of Wildlife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Ms. Bear">In terms of the time delays and the capacity issues, let me 
just give a couple of quick examples. I think I already alluded 
to one, which was an agency that essentially stopped appointing 
anybody with any NEPA expertise to do NEPA, and told everybody 
in the agency that they had to ``do NEPA,'' who had not been 
trained. That is kind of a recipe for inefficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Ms. Bear">In another situation, I met a gentleman who had been told 
he was the regional coordinator for NEPA. He had spent 6 months 
getting questions from staff on how to do things, didn't even 
know who to call to ask. Fortunately, he did come to a forum 
where I and some of my colleagues were doing some training, and 
he had yellow pads full of questions that he had written down, 
didn't know the answers. I spent an evening with him going over 
every question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Ms. Bear">So, those kinds of things certainly hurt. But one of the 
things I found that nobody has mentioned, and I am not trying 
to cast aspersions on proponents, but proponents sometimes make 
major changes in their projects for good reasons, but they hit 
the pause button in terms of giving information to agencies, or 
it has changed enough that there needs to be a change in the 
analysis. And you have already alluded to funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Ms. Bear">    There are a lot of remedies I would love to talk at great 
length about, some of the issues, I have already mentioned 
doing joint EISs with the state and Federal Government. There 
is a lot of flexibility.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"> And the utility of CEQ, in terms of being
arbitrator, mediator----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Ms. Bear">Right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Ms. Bear">    Mr. Grijalva [continuing]. And that point of decision 
making, so when the issue of we don't know who the lead agency 
comes up, that there is a mechanism to settle that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Yes. There are two formal dispute resolution
processes in the CEQ regulations, and the Supreme Court has 
said on numerous occasions that lower courts owe ``substantial 
deference'' to CEQ's interpretation of NEPA, and that no court 
has ever overturned that or questioned that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">OK. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Mr. Grijalva">    Mr. Bridges, in terms of the Millennium project that your 
testimony addresses, the role of the State Department of 
Ecology in that, they are in support of the project at this 
point?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> We have one permit and we have others that
have been challenged that are in appeal.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"> So, is that particular action at the state
level, is that contributing to the delays that you talked about 
earlier?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> Yes, I think so.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Grijalva</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Mr. Grijalva"> So, one cannot place the entire
responsibility for your complaints about delay entirely on the 
NEPA process, in so far as the Department of Ecology for the 
state has not given you complete green light.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair
now recognizes Mr. Tipton for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tipton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="575" speaker="Mr. Tipton">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank the panel
for taking the time to be able to be here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="576" speaker="Mr. Tipton">I think what I found interesting is, on both sides of the 
aisle, people are talking about a NEPA that does need some 
changes. It is not perfect. That seems to be a common thread 
that is going through, to be able to make sure that we can 
actually have those opportunities to be able to have real win-
wins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="577" speaker="Mr. Tipton">And I do find it disturbing when Mr. Willox is stating that 
we are getting comment, though, coming in from Germany having 
the full weight of an American citizen being able to comment on 
those projects, and taking in that consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="578" speaker="Mr. Tipton">    And maybe just to go off of the foreign connection end of 
it there, Mr. Howard, you had cited in your testimony, I 
believe, how long did it take in Germany to be able to get an 
approval process?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="579" speaker="Mr. Howard"> The most complex projects typically take less
than 2 years, 1 to 2 years. Environmental reviews generally 
finish within 1 year, again, on complex projects. But it is not 
because they are less environmentally sensitive, it is thought 
to be a much greener government and society than America, it is 
because they have clear lines of authority to make decisions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tipton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Mr. Tipton"> So, that streamlining process, that authority,
is something that is going to be really critical.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Mr. Howard">Authority is critical in a culture, and the
fact that there is a procedure to appoint a lead agency and to 
make a formal request to appoint it is not a substitute for an 
official who says it is my job to make sure this moves along, 
and I want to make the decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Mr. Howard">    So, processes take a long time to wind their way through.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tipton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Mr. Tipton"> Could you maybe describe for me, with that
streamlining, I think Ms. Bear had talked to it, as well. What 
if a lawsuit is filed? Even though you have had it streamlined, 
you have had an approval, if a lawsuit is filed, will that hold 
up a project?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Mr. Howard">Lawsuits do hold up projects, typically. It
depends on the project. The kinds of lawsuits we have been 
talking about are disclosure lawsuits at the end of an 
environmental review. That is typically when they are brought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Mr. Howard">    Much of the delay comes in the internal processes of first 
you do this, and then you have to have the scope, and then you 
do the scope, and then you come back, and then this agency is 
disagreeing with that agency, and then they schedule a meeting, 
and before you know it, years have gone by.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tipton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="586" speaker="Mr. Tipton">So, you are on the cusp of approval, and then
that is when the lawsuits will happen. I think you and Mr. 
Bridges have both cited in your testimony that at times the 
process has been hijacked, almost, by litigation coming in from 
activists to be able to just literally stop a project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="587" speaker="Mr. Tipton">In my own district in Colorado, we have a mining project 
that is currently 8 years in the process right now to try to be 
able to get the approvals, have constant lawsuits which are 
coming up that are stymying that. And it is impeding, actually, 
the ability to be able to achieve what I think on both sides of 
the aisle we would hope our goal is, is to be able to have 
adequate environmental review, and to be able to keep the 
trades working, and people employed, and people to be able to 
provide for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="588" speaker="Mr. Tipton">    Mr. Bridges, Mr. Howard, can you maybe give us, we have had 
a few ideas Ms. Bear has thrown out, how do we actually fix 
this to make sure that process is addressed?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="589" speaker="Mr. Howard">We have proposed legislation attached to my
testimony. But making it clear, create clear lines of authority 
to make decisions about scope and adequacy of environmental 
review in CEQ, just making it clear that that is their job, 
that is one thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="590" speaker="Mr. Howard">Second, making it clear to courts that litigation would be 
countenanced unless there are sort of either illegalities, 
omissions, or misstatements that materially affect the 
environment, not a sort of a nitpicking thing, and creating an 
expedited timetable to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="591" speaker="Mr. Howard">    If you had an expedited timetable and you had clear 
decision makers, you could constrain these processes from 8 to 
10 years down to 2 years, we think, without more legislative 
action than that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tipton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="592" speaker="Mr. Tipton"> Mr. Bridges, in the last 35 seconds, do you
have something to add?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="593" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> Nothing really to add to Mr. Howard, except
just the timelines are key, just to keep things moving and have 
a predictable timeline.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Tipton</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="594" speaker="Mr. Tipton">Great. Thank you, and I appreciate you being
here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="595" speaker="Mr. Tipton">    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="596" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> The gentleman yields back. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. LaMalfa, for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="597" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, panelists,
for being here with us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="598" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">My district is in Northern California, where we have a lot 
of issues with timber, timber management, and water management. 
We have two very large lakes, Lake Oroville and Lake Shasta, 
and two large river systems, Feather River and Sacramento 
River, as well as highway projects, and a potential water 
storage project called Sites Reservoir in my neighboring 
district to the west side of the Valley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="599" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">I find that NEPA and California's level CEQA are very 
effective tools to stop development. And I certainly understand 
the need to have a review, and a review process, but each year 
hundreds of thousands of acres burn on forest land in 
California, so you would think that, after that has occurred, 
and you have a window of time to recover timber that still has 
some value there, 6 months, even up to a year, you can help pay 
for the cost of refurbishing the forest by getting out there 
and getting after it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="600" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">So, why in the world do you need a NEPA to do something 
that is already an established practice on a pretty well-known 
zone? Yes, certainly, you figure out where the waterways are, 
and you don't drive tractors through the streams, et cetera. 
But then you also have to counter-balance, and this is what I 
think we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="601" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">The Forest Service and others need to use the NEPA on their 
side of the issue, on the management side of the issue. What 
are we doing by not taking action with forestry, salvage, 
either salvage after a fire or ongoing when you have drought, 
when you have over-crowding, over-inventory of forests with way 
too many trees per acre on the drought?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="602" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">    Mr. Willox, could you touch on a little bit, would Forest 
Service actually be able to use NEPA and set a blueprint, not a 
NEPA every single time you have to do 100 acres? I mean, that 
is just a real great thing for the cottage industry of people 
out there preparing NEPA--how many pages do you have in those 
two binders there? It must be, what, 400, 500?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="603" speaker="Mr. Willox"> Oh, close to 1,000.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="604" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Is there 1,000 in that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="605" speaker="Mr. Willox"> There are 500 in that one and 500 in that one,
front and back, small print.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="606" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> If we were to open to that, to anywhere, and
just pick, say, two-thirds of the way through, what would two 
lines say in there? Would they say anything that actually meant 
anything? How can you put that many words in a binder that 
actually mean something on managing a forest, or managing a 
levee, or building a highway? What words can you come up with?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="607" speaker="Mr. Willox"> This particular page is talking about school
districts and their enrollment on the social economic part of 
it, but I can assure you that the social economic part is 
smaller than the air quality analysis.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Is that all boiler plate they use from CEQA,
or NEPA to NEPA document? Or do they have to reinvent it every 
time they have something that might be near a school district?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Mr. Willox">It is reinvented for the school district,
specifically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Mr. Willox">But going back to your original question on the forest, if 
you have a forest plan that you can manage an entire area under 
a document, then you would not have to do individual, small 
ones, you could take a broader landscape approach view to how 
you should do forest health, because it is inter-related.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Mr. Willox">    You could do one in the front range of Colorado. You could 
do one for the southern Wyoming and then be able to harvest 
that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Like we have in California, the northwest
forest plan.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Mr. Willox"> Yes, absolutely.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">So, it is supposed to be regional, you would
have a blueprint to do anything you need to do, without having 
to stop the works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">    Again, when you are getting back to timber salvage----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Mr. Willox">Correct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Mr. Willox">    Mr. LaMalfa [continuing]. You are losing the time, the 
window to salvage that timber. Now it has become useless. And 
there is not enough money in any Treasury to do all the 
millions of acres that need to be done at a non-profit level. 
And that is the sad thing with all this.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Mr. Willox"> I think the thing that the NEPA process causes
a problem for is sometimes there is an emergency or a short-
term situation that you need to get in there in a reasonable 
time, and the current time frame that we exist under sometimes 
does not allow it to be reasonable to get in there, let alone 
even allow it to be in there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">Well, thankfully, I also have Lake Oroville,
where the spillway broke this last February, and we were able 
to put aside some things because it was an emergency 
threatening downhill communities, and maybe the integrity of 
the dam. But again, we are losing opportunity to make the area 
safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa">    Maybe, Mr. Bridges, you would like to touch on this a 
little bit. We had a lot of great jobs that were being done up 
there on the dam recovery, as well as a potential project 
called Highway 70 south of Oroville and Butte County, which 
would be the last link to actually have four lanes all through 
a fairly populous county. Yet, my understanding of the cost is 
it is going to be $30 million to do a combined NEPA and 
California CEQA environmental document to add a couple lanes to 
an already-existing highway. It is already there. No new sin is 
being committed. More lanes and anywhere from 2 to 4 more years 
of study. Please touch on what that means, as far as getting 
the work done and getting the jobs out there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bridges</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Mr. Bridges"> It sure sounds like a lot for what you are
describing, just to add a couple of lanes. It just seems that 
would impact, that is all going to be running through 
California's budget.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> The gentleman's time has expired.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. LaMalfa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Mr. LaMalfa"> Federal money and state money, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady, Ms.
Bordallo, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bordallo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Ms. Bordallo">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for
being late. I had another committee hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Ms. Bordallo">Ms. Bear, I have a question for you. Thank you for your 
career of service under both Republican and Democratic 
administrations at the White House Council on Environmental 
Quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Ms. Bordallo">    The U.S. Department of Defense is among our largest Federal 
management agency. Can you please speak to the role the NEPA 
process plays in holding the Defense Department accountable to 
concerns raised by local communities?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Ms. Bear">Sure. The military services, in my experience
while I was at CEQ, there are some exceptions to this, but as a 
general rule, they are some of the most efficient agencies in 
implementing NEPA. But it is critical to the communities around 
installations and bases that they do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Ms. Bear">And I had a number of experiences with private citizens--
this is not an area, frankly, where either trade associations 
or a lot of public interest groups tend to focus. But private 
citizens in the communities around military installations focus 
a lot on what changes are going to be impacting their 
businesses and quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="630" speaker="Ms. Bear">And just to give a short example, a lady called me one day 
at the CEQ. She had never heard of NEPA until the week before 
she called me. And that is true of a lot of citizens, they are 
not familiar with the law until something happens to bring it 
to their attention. She ran a small recreation business in New 
Mexico. I think it was near a mountain range, and there was a 
lot of recreation. And part of the base was also used for 
recreation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="631" speaker="Ms. Bear">Long story short, she found our regulations. She told me 
that she read the entire booklet of regulations out loud to her 
husband while they were driving back from Las Vegas. They were 
still married at the end of the trip, which I thought was 
interesting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Ms. Bear">But seriously, she was so excited to learn that there was a 
framework where she could talk to the Air Force, and that they 
had to respond to her about the changes they were proposing, 
which were going to reduce recreation opportunities, that she 
would have a chance to have input into that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Ms. Bear">    That is just one example. There are a lot of examples in, 
of course, Hawaii and other places in the Pacific, where it is 
certainly critical.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bordallo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Ms. Bordallo"> Thank you. I have another. Do you see a
connection between enactment of the National Environmental 
Policy Act, the NEPA, in 1970 and better public health and 
environmental safeguards at U.S. military installations today?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Yes. I think the passage of NEPA and some of the
other laws that were passed in the 1970s have done a lot to 
raise the military consciousness, and again, this is a wild 
generalization, but a lot of installations on bases try very 
hard to be good environmental citizens, but that was spurred by 
the passage of those laws.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bordallo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Ms. Bordallo">Right. I just have a comment to make, Mr.
Chairman. On Guam, more than one-fourth of the island is U.S. 
Department of Defense land. The NEPA is oftentimes the only 
mechanism for the public to have a seat at the table so their 
voices are heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Ms. Bordallo">Absent the NEPA process, those on Guam lacking on-base 
access privileges would have no way of influencing or even 
knowing about decisions made by the Defense Department 
affecting our island. I just wanted that information to get to 
you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Ms. Bordallo">And I think that is just about it. I have one more 
question. Do I have any time? All right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Ms. Bordallo">    Do you agree that the NEPA process generally results in 
well-planned projects, and ultimately more responsible Federal 
decisions for taxpayer resources?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Generally, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bordallo</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Ms. Bordallo">Yes. All right. Thank you, Ms. Bear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Ms. Bordallo">    And thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Graves, for 5 
minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Graves</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Mr. Graves">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for
being here. Ms. Bear, thank you for your government service 
over many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Mr. Graves">I have a question. The National Environmental Policy Act 
applies to projects that involve Federal dollars, Federal 
lands, or events when Federal waters, for example, may be 
impacted. If those criteria are not met--I believe there are 
four criteria, as I recall, in terms of triggering the 
application of NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Mr. Graves">    So, for example, if a private entity, if a state entity, or 
a local entity wanted to carry out a project that did not cross 
those thresholds, would NEPA apply?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Ms. Bear"> No.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Graves</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Mr. Graves">OK, so in most instances NEPA would not apply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Mr. Graves">Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to point out that the 
majority of projects that are carried out across this Nation do 
not go through a NEPA process. And the reason I point that out 
is because there were some comments that were made earlier that 
suggest, I think the question was asked if NEPA were eliminated 
what would happen. And that question was somewhat bizarre, and 
I think it was unfair, because it is based upon a premise that 
our local governments, our state governments don't care about 
the environment. And I refuse to believe that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Mr. Graves">As a former state government employee, I spent much of my 
life working on efforts to find the right balance. In fact, I 
would argue that we probably did more to restore our coastal 
resources in Louisiana than anywhere else in the United States. 
It is fascinating to me that that seems to be lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Mr. Graves">So, I want to say it again: The majority of projects 
carried out across the United States, NEPA does not apply. And 
in many cases, there are public engagement requirements by 
local governments, by state governments, and others that would 
apply, that would allow for an opportunity for the public to be 
engaged in projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Mr. Graves">Ms. Bear, I am not sure if you are familiar, but I believe 
you were at CEQ at the time. Following Hurricanes Katrina and 
Rita in 2005, CEQ, and I want to thank you to the extent you 
were involved, helped work with us and the Corps of Engineers 
to negotiate alternative arrangements for compliance with NEPA. 
Without getting into all the details, because as I recall it 
was a pretty thick document, we were allowed to go through this 
IEPR process where we were able to effectively do the 
environmental mitigation and quantifying of environmental 
impacts after the fact. Most of the environmental groups--in 
fact, I am not going to say my memory is perfect, but I don't 
recall a single environmental group indicating there were any 
problems that resulted from that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Mr. Graves">    Do you recall that, or other experiences, where alternative 
arrangements were worked out?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Graves</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Mr. Graves"> And where it didn't result in a detriment to
the environment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Ms. Bear">Yes. There is a provision in the CEQ regulations
to deal with emergencies that allows CEQ to develop alternative 
arrangements when normally an environmental impact statement 
would be required. That has been used about 37 times or so. I 
can submit the list for the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Ms. Bear">And that has been used in a variety of circumstances, 
natural disasters, people shooting each other over fishery 
management lines--fortunately, that was only one time--but a 
wide variety of situations. And that has been done, I did one 
in 48 hours that was a critical emergency. A lot of times, most 
of the time, frankly, even though it is an emergency, and 
people cannot take 2 years or 4 years, or whatever it might 
take otherwise, they may need 3 weeks or a month or 6 weeks to 
get equipment and engineers and everything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Ms. Bear">    So, CEQ will take what time is available before action can 
be taken, and essentially take the most important elements of 
the NEPA process, spend a lot of time on the phone, sometimes 
do site visits or public meetings for alternative arrangements 
on a very quick basis, and get everybody involved. Not 
everybody has always been happy----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Graves</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="659" speaker="Mr. Graves">All right, let me interrupt you there. I am
running out of time, and I have two other points I need to 
make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="660" speaker="Mr. Graves">Number one, Mr. Chairman, every hearing where there is any 
degree of relevance, I like to point out the fact that the 
Federal Government, our own Federal Government, has caused 
2,000 square miles of coastal wetlands loss, and the primary 
cause of that loss in the state of Louisiana, surprisingly, 
NEPA has been applied in this case, yet our own Federal 
Government is the greatest historic ongoing and future cause of 
wetlands loss in the United States, as a result of how the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers manages the Mississippi River system 
and its resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="661" speaker="Mr. Graves">    They have done nothing, absolutely nothing, to mitigate 
those losses that they have caused. Efforts by the state of 
Louisiana, including nearly $1 billion in Federal funds--excuse 
me, in non-Federal funds--that are in the bank today for a 
project Mid-Barataria, designed solely to restore the 
environment is now being obstructed by the Corps of Engineers 
and by NOAA under the auspices of environmental reviews.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="662" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> The gentleman's time has expired.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Graves</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="663" speaker="Mr. Graves">Five years, let me just make one comment, just
for the record, Mr. Chairman, I know I am out of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="664" speaker="Mr. Graves">Mr. Chairman, earlier Mr. Huffman noted that the Keystone 
Pipeline had spilled oil. I think it is really important that 
we make comments based upon fact. The reality is, when you look 
at statistics, transporting oil by pipeline is a safer 
mechanism than rail, by boats, and other things, trucks, and 
others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="665" speaker="Mr. Graves">So, while I will not support, obviously, and I don't 
support the spilling of oil in any circumstance, I do think it 
is important that we discuss facts here. And it is safer to 
transport oil by pipeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="666" speaker="Mr. Graves">    With that, I yield back. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="667" speaker="Mr. Westerman"> The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair
now recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="668" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to associate
myself with all the comments of my learned colleague from 
Louisiana, Garret Graves. We agree on all that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="669" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Thank you to the witnesses for taking your time today to be 
here and share your testimony with our Committee. It is 
valuable. All of us cannot be here all at the same time, but we 
all review the record, and you know how this works, so thank 
you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="670" speaker="Mr. Johnson">NEPA has been hailed as the Magna Carta of environmental 
law, but its implementation has historically been plagued by 
bureaucratic burdens. And you have all offered a lot of insight 
on that today. It is important to ensure that the EIS process 
is efficient and is free from undue burden as possible. 
Unfortunately, the EIS process is extremely time-consuming and 
expensive, as we have discussed. The greatest contributor to 
the problem arises from appeals in litigation from outside 
groups. That is my firm belief. And that, of course, causes 
delays and increased cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="671" speaker="Mr. Johnson">A 2014 GAO report revealed that the average time to 
complete an EIS was 4.6 years. Equally as troubling, the 
average cost of a single EIS for the Department of Energy is 
$6.6 million. At that time, no governmental-wide analysis was 
available to calculate an average EIS cost across all the 
agencies. But the same GAO report found that less intensive 
environmental assessments cost a whole lot less. They are 
between $5,000 and $200,000 across all agencies. Furthermore, 
the CEQ estimates that EAs take an average of only 13 months to 
complete, as opposed to 4.6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="672" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    Mr. Willox, a couple of questions. The appeals and 
litigation are clearly part of the problem with regard to time 
and cost. And the question is, are there ways we can work 
within the current framework to minimize the delays that add to 
the process?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Mr. Willox">Thank you. The litigation one is a hard one to
address, because the law allows that litigation. So, unless you 
create some sideboards of what is litigatable, and I think Mr. 
Howard had a recommendation that you narrow it to the actual 
impacts, not technical things, would be beneficial. And the 
fear of litigation is postponing or delaying projects, whether 
it happens or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Mr. Willox">    I mentioned I have 830 pages of air quality analysis. You 
are going to find something in there that you could probably 
object to. So, I think that would be one sideboard that would 
be helpful.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Mr. Johnson">That is great. Another question. Secretary
Zinke issued a memo in March of this year that raised several 
concerns about the NEPA process. I know that has been brought 
up today. One of the Secretary's concerns dealt with 
transparency in creating EISs, including proper accounting of 
time frames, delays, and financial cost of those analyses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="676" speaker="Mr. Johnson">What should be done to address the Secretary's concerns and 
foster greater transparency, so that the agencies can be held 
accountable for the inefficiency?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    Why don't you start with that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Mr. Willox">Well, public input has been talked about here,
and I don't think you can eliminate public input. But as we put 
it, early input is important. Having the local government 
officials there early who do represent the public, we are all 
elected from that body, as are you. So, having that early and 
often as part of the process would be helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Mr. Willox">I think it is a very transparent process, it is just 
cumbersome. This is transparent. It is all here. But how does 
the average member of the public do a fair job of commenting on 
something that is this large?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Mr. Willox">    I think having more brevity and more succinct EISs would 
allow for better comment, so the public can actually know what 
is going on, and then provide reasonable alternatives if they 
so desire.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="681" speaker="Mr. Johnson">I agree with you. Simplicity and efficiency
help with transparency. No one can wade through all this, and 
that is part of the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="682" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    Mr. Howard, one for you. In this effort to increase 
transparency, what role does information-sharing between 
agencies play in streamlining the NEPA process to reduce some 
of this duplicative and disproportionate analyses? Do you have 
a thought on that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="683" speaker="Mr. Howard">There is an unavoidable complication when you
have a project that has a dozen or more agencies involved. And 
I will go back to my one theme: Somebody has to be in charge of 
the process, and somebody has to be able to make decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="684" speaker="Mr. Howard">To the transparency point, and I have talked to Secretary 
Zinke about these problems, it would be so important to have an 
analysis at the beginning of a project about what the effects 
of delay of the environmental review will be. In other words, 
you need to balance, like we were talking about a forestry 
example, the cost of the delay with the benefits you are going 
to get from it. There ought to be a rule of reason at the 
outset. And they don't do that. It is all about, let's study as 
much as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="685" speaker="Mr. Howard">    If you really want to do a human-scale effective 
environmental review process, you need to actually make 
decisions at the outset, and this requires somebody to be in 
charge asking how much should we really do here, and what would 
be the cost if we waited an extra year or two? Because the 
costs often are going to harm the environment.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Johnson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Mr. Johnson">Thank you for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Mr. Johnson">    I only have 10 seconds left, so I think I am out of time. I 
yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The gentleman yields back. I now recognize
myself for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="689" speaker="Mr. Westerman">I would like to thank all the witnesses for being here 
today, and for your testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="690" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Mr. Willox, I found your testimony to be particularly 
relevant to a situation being experienced by residents in my 
home state of Arkansas. In March of 2016, former Secretary of 
Energy Ernest Moniz granted Federal eminent domain to a 
private, for-profit company by approving the Clean Line Energy 
project. This was after Arkansas' Public Service Commission, 
the legislature, and every member of our Federal delegation

    <paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Mr. Westerman">This electric line will cover a path across private land 
through Arkansas' Ozark Mountains, a river valley, and delta 
regions, which are some of the most beautiful and productive 
land our state has to offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Mr. Westerman">I said all of that to say this: Some of the struggles and 
headwinds that Clean Line faced from hundreds of private 
property owners and the Arkansas Public Service Commission 
could have been avoided by running the transmission line 
through one property owner, the Ozark National Forest.</paragraph>

    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="694" speaker="Mr. Westerman">And if you look at the map, you see the red
line, and all that green just north of the red line is Ozark 
National Forest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Like Mr. Willox mentioned in his testimony, Clean Line 
declined to do this, citing the overly burdensome and 
bureaucratic red tape they would face in that situation. I find 
this to be very two-faced of a government formed to protect the 
rights of the governed. On the one hand, the rules are so 
onerous that developers don't even consider Federal land, and 
on the other hand, the same government sanctions the 
unprecedented confiscation of private property by a private 
corporation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="696" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    Mr. Willox, when did you first notice that industry was 
beginning to re-route projects to avoid any type of Federal 
land?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Willox</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="697" speaker="Mr. Willox">It has been ongoing for some time. The power
line that I cite in my testimony is actually a fellow 
commissioner that does it for a living, and he is constantly 
re-routing stuff. You see it in pipelines. Many times you will 
see a pipeline go and it just does 360s to go around Federal 
ground, imposing a burden on private property rights, which I 
think is a pertinent point that you make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="698" speaker="Mr. Willox">    That seems to be incongruent with what we want to have 
happen, as let's have the Federal Government say no so we can 
impose it on the private property owner. And that seems to be a 
problem, and not right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Mr. Westerman">I want to shift gears a little bit and talk
about NEPA and how it specifically relates to forestry. Being a 
forester, I have never really understood why NEPA is so 
complicated for forestry projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="700" speaker="Mr. Westerman">I think back to when I was in forestry school, and I had a 
classmate who was actually an instructor at the Yale School of 
Medicine. He decided to come over to the forestry and 
environmental school and learn forestry, and he made an 
interesting observation one day. He said that in forestry, 
trees are like people, and foresters are like doctors. He said, 
``Foresters apply the best science to keep trees and forests 
healthy.'' That is really what forestry is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="701" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Forestry is not clear-cutting. Forestry is not just about 
producing timber, which, by the way, is the most 
environmentally friendly material we have. Forestry is about 
forest health and conservation. Foremost, that is what it is 
about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Mr. Westerman">And we know that actions do speak louder than words. Since 
NEPA, instead of forest science, the controlling factor in 
management of the forest has been NEPA. Our Federal timber land 
health has suffered greatly since that has happened. Of our 193 
million acres of Forest Service land, 80 million right now, 
according to the Forest Service, are subject to catastrophic 
wildfire. And we saw over 8.5 million acres go up in flames 
just this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    We have heard how NEPA only delays 1 percent of projects, 
but, Ms. Bear, can you give me just one modern example where 
NEPA has made a forest healthier, or not delayed science-based 
forest management practices from being implemented?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Bear</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Ms. Bear"> Actually, Congress passed a law, I am not going
to get the year right, but I am thinking it was about 2005, 
called the Healthy Forest Act, which was designed to address a 
lot of the concerns that you raised, and it has an expedited 
process for addressing a lot of those concerns.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Westerman</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Mr. Westerman">That process has not been used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="706" speaker="Mr. Westerman">    A quick question, Mr. Howard. Does the current NEPA process 
work for the common good of the forest?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Howard</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="707" speaker="Mr. Howard"> There are benefits to the current NEPA process.
I think the review is important. But it is undermining the 
common good by taking too long and being too inaccessible to 
real people.

    <paragraph paraId="718" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Prepared Statement of the Hon. Jeff Denham, a Representative in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="719" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Congress from the State of California</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="720" speaker="Mr. Westerman">In the 114th Congress, I introduced H.R. 2497, the NEPA Reciprocity 
Act. This legislation proposed changes to Title 23 of the United States 
Code to create a program for alternative environmental reviews and 
approvals whereby state law would substitute for Federal laws in 
certain circumstances. A state could apply if they are able to 
demonstrate that a state environmental review law is equivalent to or 
more stringent than NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="721" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Under this process, California projects (if accepted into the 
program) could bypass a duplicative and redundant second layer of 
review, dramatically streamlining the project delivery process. A 
participating state could manage the program with approval of the 
appropriate Secretary and exercise the program on behalf of local 
governments for local projects. Flexibility of this kind would expedite 
the permitting process in constructing important infrastructure 
projects faster, saving taxpayer dollars and growing the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="722" speaker="Mr. Westerman">This legislation was the genesis for Section 1309 of the Fixing 
America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, titled Program For 
Eliminating Duplication of Environmental Reviews. This section of the 
law established a pilot program at the Department of Transportation 
very similar to my bill. The project allows up to five states to 
substitute statewide environmental review laws for NEPA in respect to 
transportation projects, if they meet certain criteria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="723" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Please notice that substituting NEPA reviews with state 
environmental review laws is a different concept from allowing states 
to be delegated NEPA authority, which currently occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="724" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Although this was already signed into law, we do not yet have 
concrete results since the project is not yet underway. The comment 
period for the proposed rule just closed yesterday. However, state 
interest, especially from California, has already been significant.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="728" speaker="Mr. Westerman">On behalf of the American Road &amp; Transportation Builders 
Association (ARTBA) and its more than 7,500 member firms and public 
agencies nationwide, the association would like to thank Chairman 
Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for holding today's hearing on 
``Modernizing NEPA for the 21st Century.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="729" speaker="Mr. Westerman">ARTBA, now in its 117th year of service, provides federal 
representation for more than 7,500 members from all sectors of the U.S. 
transportation construction industry. ARTBA's membership includes 
private firms and organizations, as well as public agencies that own, 
plan, design, supply and construct transportation projects throughout 
the country. Our industry generates more than $380 billion annually in 
U.S. economic activity and sustains more than 3.3 million American 
jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="730" speaker="Mr. Westerman">ARTBA members must directly navigate the regulatory process to 
deliver transportation improvements. As such, they have first-hand 
knowledge about specific federal burdens that can and should be 
alleviated. Because of the nature of their businesses, ARTBA members 
undertake a variety of activities that are directly impacted by the 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). ARTBA supports NEPA and 
realizes it is an integral component of the transportation planning 
process. Many, if not all, of the significant environmental 
achievements of the transportation community and ARTBA members would 
not be possible without NEPA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="731" speaker="Mr. Westerman">ARTBA recognizes that regulations play a vital role in protecting 
the public interest in the transportation project review and approval 
process. They provide a sense of predictability and ensure a balance 
between meeting our nation's transportation needs and protecting vital 
natural resources. These goals, however, do not have to be in conflict. 
The most successful transportation streamlining provisions have been 
process oriented and have essentially found a path for regulatory 
requirements to be fulfilled in a smarter and more efficient manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="732" speaker="Mr. Westerman">According to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office 
prior to the enactment of MAP-21, as many as 200 major steps were 
involved in developing a transportation project, from the 
identification of the project need to the start of construction. The 
same report also shows it typically takes between nine and 19 years to 
plan, gain approval of, and construct a new major federally-funded 
highway project. This process involves dozens of overlapping state and 
federal laws, including: NEPA; state NEPA equivalents; wetland permits; 
endangered species implementation; and clean air conformity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="733" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Further, project delays carry severe financial consequences. 
According to a 2016 report by the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute, 
project delay is estimated to cost $87,000 per month for small projects 
(e.g., reconstruction), $420,000 per month for medium-sized projects 
(e.g., widening) and $1.3 million per month for large projects.\1\ Both 
political parties recognized that the current system was simply too 
long and too expensive a way to deliver transportation projects that 
improve mobility and safety. As such, finding meaningful ways to 
expedite this process has been a congressional priority for more than 
15 years.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="735" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Significant progress was made on a bipartisan basis to streamline 
the permitting and approval process for transportation improvements in 
the past four reauthorizations of the federal surface transportation 
program: the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) of 
1998; the Safe, Accountable, Flexible Efficient Transportation Equity 
Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) of 2005; the Moving Ahead for 
Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) Act of 2012; and, most recently, 
the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act of 2015. Each of 
these measures provides valuable insight about the successes and 
failures of legislative efforts to reduce delay in the delivery of 
needed transportation projects without sacrificing regulatory 
safeguards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="736" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Reducing Project Delay</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="737" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Reducing the amount of time it takes to build transportation 
improvements was first addressed in 1998 with the passage of TEA-21. 
Efforts to reduce delay in this legislation concentrated on 
establishing concurrent project reviews by different federal agencies. 
The concept was that multiple reviews done at the same time, as opposed 
to one after the other, would reduce the amount of overall time it took 
to get a project approved. While this improvement was a step in the 
right direction, it had limited impact, as concurrent reviews were 
discretionary, rather than mandatory. Thus, it was up to the federal 
agencies involved in a project whether or not to take advantage of this 
new benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="738" speaker="Mr. Westerman">In 2005, SAFETEA-LU sought to further reform the project delivery 
process by establishing a wider range of new ways to deliver 
transportation improvements. Specifically, SAFETEA-LU gave greater 
authority to the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) as ``lead 
agency'' during the project delivery process, limited the window during 
which lawsuits could be filed against projects, and reformed the 
process for determining impacts on historical sites and wildlife 
refuges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="739" speaker="Mr. Westerman">SAFETEA-LU represented a far more expansive reforming of the 
project delivery process, by addressing the schedule for project 
reviews and also factors outside of the process itself which contribute 
to delay. SAFETEA-LU also went further than TEA-21 in that some of its 
reforms, such as the limitation on lawsuits, were mandatory, as opposed 
to optional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="740" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The clear lesson between the 1998 and 2005 surface transportation 
bills was that simply giving federal agencies the ability to complete 
regulatory reviews in a more efficient manner in no way guarantees that 
authority would be utilized. As such, SAFETEA-LU took more aggressive 
steps to influence non-transportation agencies into making 
transportation project reviews a higher priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="741" speaker="Mr. Westerman">While SAFETEA-LU's environmental streamlining provisions were a 
significant step forward from those enacted in TEA-21, the 
transportation project delivery process remained at an unacceptable 
pace. As such, both MAP-21 and the FAST Act took project delivery 
reform even further, with more tools for reducing delay. In addition to 
building upon the concept of ``lead agency'' begun in SAFETEA-LU, MAP-
21 and the FAST Act also included specific deadlines for permitting 
decisions as well as a scheduling mechanism to ensure environmental 
impact statements (EISs) do not take longer than four years. As with 
SAFETEA-LU, however, it is important to note that many of the reforms 
made in MAP-21 and the FAST Act were discretionary. The more state and 
federal agencies choose to use these reforms, the greater the impact 
will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="742" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Expansion of the Use of Categorical Exclusions</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="743" speaker="Mr. Westerman">One of the most significant changes to existing law in both MAP-21 
and the FAST Act was an expansion of the use of categorical exclusions 
(CEs) during the environmental review process. A CE is used when 
projects create minimal impacts on the environment. The difference 
between a CE and an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental 
impact statement (EIS) is multiple years added on to the amount of time 
it takes to complete a project review. Under MAP-21, many sorts of 
routine projects were automatically classified as CEs, these include 
rehabilitation and repair projects, projects within an existing right-
of-way, projects with minimal federal resources and projects undertaken 
as a result of an emergency situation. Expanding the use of CEs to 
these additional areas enables local governments to have more certainty 
as to when a CE can be used and also allows routine projects to be 
undertaken without burdensome, unnecessary levels of review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="744" speaker="Mr. Westerman">MAP-21 also called for the development of CE guidelines for 
projects being constructed in response to an emergency or natural 
disaster. To qualify for CE status, such a project must be of the same 
mode/type and in the same right-of-way as the facility it is replacing 
and started within two years after the emergency/natural disaster. It 
should be noted that MAP-21 also offers states additional flexibility 
in emergency situations by allowing the issuance of special permits to 
overweight vehicles delivering relief supplies and allows states to use 
any federal highway program apportionments other than those dedicated 
for local governments to replace transportation facilities damaged by a 
national emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="745" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Only three months after the emergency/natural disaster CE was 
promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), it was 
put to use in May 2013 when a truck hit the I-5 Skagit River Bridge in 
Mount Vernon, Washington. Application of the CE allowed repairs to the 
bridge to begin swiftly, and correctly recognized that in times of 
emergency, the focus should be on responding as promptly and 
effectively as possible. Specifically, in this instance repairs began 
within 24 hours after the accident and the bridge was re-opened to 
traffic in just 27 days and fully repaired within 115 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="746" speaker="Mr. Westerman">MAP-21 also created a CE for projects within an existing right-of-
way. This is a logical application of the CE process, as an 
environmental review would have already had to be completed in order 
for the right-of-way to be obtained. Thus, requiring a second 
environmental review for a project within that right of way is 
duplicative and adds no additional environmental protection. The Texas 
Department of Transportation (TXDOT) noted a Houston widening project 
undertaken prior to MAP-21 involving a widening of a four-lane road. 
Although no additional right-of-way was required, an EA was deemed 
necessary. The EA took three years and cost $100,000. Under MAP-21, 
that same project would qualify for a CE and be completed in a fraction 
of the time and cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="747" speaker="Mr. Westerman">NEPA was never meant to be a statute enabling delay, but rather a 
vehicle to promote balance. While the centerpiece of such a balancing 
is the environmental impacts of a project, other factors must be 
considered as well, such as the economic, safety, and mobility needs of 
the affected area and how a project or any identified alternative will 
affect those needs. Allowing certain types of projects to be classified 
as CEs is a very effective way of reducing delay in the review and 
approval process, ensuring that projects with minimal environmental 
impacts are not put through a needlessly long regulatory process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="748" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Additionally, the current system for processing CEs should be 
examined in order to reduce unnecessary delay. Under Section 1315 of 
the FAST Act, FHWA, on behalf of the Secretary of Transportation, 
developed a programmatic agreement template for CEs as required by the 
legislation. The FAST Act specifically states the template was to be 
developed for CEs listed in section 771.117(c) of title 23, Code of 
Federal Regulations. ARTBA believes the intent of this requirement was 
to provide a single, uniform process for processing CEs on the ``c 
list'', which now include three previous ``d list'' CEs and associated 
constraints. Previously, there were no constraints associated with the 
use of ``c list'' CEs except for ``unusual circumstance''. It should be 
noted that FHWA already has a 1989 programmatic model for the ``d-
list'' CEs.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="749" speaker="Mr. Westerman">\2\ https://www.environment.fhwa.dot.gov/projdev/docuceda.asp.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="750" speaker="Mr. Westerman">As stated in 23 CFR 771.117(c), ``c-list'' CEs normally do not 
require any further NEPA approvals by the FHWA while ``d-list'' CEs 
require additional documentation to be sent to a federal agency as 
outlined by FHWA's 1989 programmatic model for ``d-list'' CEs. The 
purpose of the programmatic agreement template under the FAST Act was 
to ensure that with the addition of the three previously listed ``d-
list'' CEs and associated constraints to the ``c-list'' that a template 
be developed to provide guidance on how to properly document ``c-list'' 
CEs which now includes the three CEs with constraints in an efficient 
manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="751" speaker="Mr. Westerman">FHWA did not develop a template for the ``c-list'' CEs as required 
by the FAST Act, but one for both the ``c-list &amp; d-list'' CEs. While 
there is not a specific issue with a template that covers both the ``c-
list and d-list'' CEs, there is an issue with the template placing 
historical ``d-list'' constraints on the use of ``c-list'' CEs and 
constraints which are not required under Federal Regulations. The FHWA 
developed template is more restrictive and burdensome than the Federal 
Regulation for those projects with ``c-list'' CEs and requires more 
case by case review by FHWA than what the Federal Regulations require. 
This was not the intent of the FAST Act language, nor the intent of 
programmatic agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="752" speaker="Mr. Westerman">FHWA should be directed to re-examine the FAST Act developed model 
programmatic agreement for CEs and remedy the language to fit the 
intent of the FAST Act and its underlying regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="753" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Delegation of Environmental Review Responsibilities</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="754" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Under SAFETEA-LU, a pilot program was established allowing five 
states (California, Alaska, Ohio, Texas and Oklahoma) to assume the 
role of the federal government during the NEPA process. MAP-21 expanded 
the opportunity to participate in the program to all states. States 
choosing to take part would conduct their own environmental reviews, 
potentially saving time as a result of not having to go through 
multiple federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="755" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Of the five states allowed to participate in the delegation pilot 
program under SAFETEA-LU, only California chose to do so and was 
approved in 2006. Under MAP-21, Texas was approved to participate in 
December of 2014. More recently, Ohio applied for the delegation 
program in 2015 and has just had its first federal audit while both 
Florida and Utah submitted applications last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="756" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The Committee needs only to look to California and Texas--the two 
states which have the longest running NEPA delegation programs--to see 
what continued use of the delegation program can achieve. Specifically, 
an Oct. 30, 2015, fact sheet published by the California Department of 
Transportation demonstrates the following significant reductions in 
delay preparing environmental review documents:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="757" speaker="Mr. Westerman">&lt;bullet&gt; Draft EAs have seen a median time savings of 10.7 months;</paragraph>

the human and natural environment. Empowering states in this way saves

---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="770" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Additionally, MAP-21 allows states to also assume control of just 
the CE process as opposed to full environmental reviews. TXDOT has 
experienced a significant reduction in the time it takes to review CEs 
through this partial delegation program. Prior to assuming 
responsibility for CE review, the process took about one year. Under 
the program, the average time is now less than 45 days. Further, the 
documentation requirements have been reduced. CEs which used to span 
more than 100 pages are now two-page checklists. Utah has also assumed 
control of the CE process under MAP-21 and is now completing CEs in as 
little as six days for routine projects. Finally, Alaska has also 
assumed responsibility for CEs and is experiencing favorable results 
from the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="771" speaker="Mr. Westerman">While the reason for non-participation thus far by the other states 
has varied, potential liability and litigation costs were an overriding 
issue, as the state would also be assuming federal responsibilities for 
litigation over any project where delegation was used. Still, ARTBA 
believes delegation of environmental review responsibilities to states 
could be an important tool to save resources and speed project delivery 
without sacrificing regulatory safeguards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="772" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Greater Strength for ``Lead Agencies''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="773" speaker="Mr. Westerman">SAFETEA-LU established U.S. DOT as the ``lead agency'' for the 
environmental review of transportation projects, including ``purpose 
and need'' and ``range of alternatives'' determinations. MAP-21 
expanded upon this authority by allowing U.S. DOT, as the lead agency 
for all transportation projects, to name a single modal administration 
as the lead agency in the case of multi-modal projects. The Secretary 
of Transportation also may, within 30 days of the closing of the 
comment period for a draft EIS, convene a meeting of the lead agency, 
participating agencies and project sponsor to set a schedule for 
meeting project deadlines. This new authority allowed the U.S. DOT to 
be the focal point of the review process, as opposed to a peer on equal 
footing with non-transportation agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="774" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The basic problem is that the development of a transportation 
project involves multiple agencies besides DOT evaluating the impacts 
of the project as required by NEPA. While it would seem that the NEPA 
process would establish a uniform set of regulations and submittal 
documents nationwide, this has not been the case. For example, the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Army Corps of 
Engineers (Corps), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and their companion 
state agencies each require an independent review and approval process, 
forcing separate reviews of separate regulations, and unique 
determinations of key benchmark issues--such as the purpose and needs 
of a project--and requiring planners to answer multiple requests for 
additional information. Also, each of these agencies issues approvals 
according to independent schedules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="775" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The opportunities to reduce the delay caused by inter-agency 
conflict provided by SAFETEA-LU, MAP-21 and the FAST Act in the area of 
lead agency are significant. However, these reforms are only effective 
to the degree that the U.S. DOT chooses to take advantage of them. In 
other words, it is not mandatory that the agency take advantage of any 
of the benefits of ``lead agency'' status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="776" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Even as an optional tool, though, ``lead agency'' status is an 
important mechanism for improving the project delivery process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="777" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Additional Project Delivery Reforms</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="778" speaker="Mr. Westerman">MAP-21 also improved project delivery by limiting the time during 
which lawsuits may be filed against projects. This concept was also 
part of SAFETEA-LU. SAFETEA-LU set a deadline of 180 days after the 
issuance of a federal decision on a project for the filing of a 
lawsuit. MAP-21 shortened this deadline to 150 days. Establishing a 
firm deadline for lawsuits ensures that any possible litigation is 
dealt with at the beginning of the delivery process. By addressing 
conflicts early, planners then are able to set schedules without fear 
of litigation after the deadlines have passed. Further, the deadline 
allows conflicts to be heard and resolved sooner, rather than later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="779" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Under MAP-21, project sponsors were allowed to request the 
Secretary of Transportation to set an expedited schedule for projects 
undergoing an EIS for more than two years. This schedule would ensure 
the project's EIS would be completed within two additional years. MAP-
21 also establishes new deadlines for permitting decisions from federal 
agencies. If these deadlines are not met, the agencies suffer financial 
penalties. It should be noted, however, that these provisions of MAP-21 
have not yet been utilized and it remains to be seen how they would 
work in practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="780" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Other Suggestions for NEPA Reform</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="781" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Encouraging concise NEPA documents: Currently, the EIS process for 
a new highway project is a multi-year endeavor. A major reason for this 
is the length of the EIS itself, which can literally span multiple 
volumes totaling thousands of pages under the current NEPA regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="782" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The EIS is meant as a resource for affected members of the 
community to gain information about the proposed project. Current EISs 
are impossible for many lawyers to understand and completely 
inaccessible to community members without any prior training in the 
fields of law or environmental consulting. One factor behind lengthy 
EISs is the fear of litigation on the part of project developers. In an 
effort to anticipate issues which could be used to delay a project 
through litigation, project developers have reportedly attempted to 
``bulletproof'' their EISs. This results in a document which attempts 
to address every possible issue or scenario to arise in connection with 
a proposed project no matter the relevance or how likely it is to be a 
factor in environmental decision making. The end product of this 
process is an EIS which is completely unwieldy and does not serve its 
intended purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="783" speaker="Mr. Westerman">ARTBA recommends setting a page limit threshold on the length of 
EISs that would help them better serve the communities for which they 
are intended to be written. It would also force the authors of EISs to 
write in clear and more concise terms. Finally, it would reduce the 
delay associated with new transportation construction projects by 
dramatically cutting down the time needed to complete the final 
document.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="784" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Integrating NEPA with planning: Another reform ARTBA supports is 
integration of NEPA with the transportation planning process. ARTBA has 
recommended increased integration of NEPA in both legislative and 
regulatory settings repeatedly and the issue is also one ARTBA has 
recommended be part of the next reauthorization legislation for the 
federal surface transportation program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="785" speaker="Mr. Westerman">For transportation projects, an extensive amount of information is 
gathered during the planning process, which often occurs prior to the 
actual triggering of NEPA requirements. Allowing information gathered 
during the planning process, to the extent it is still current and 
relevant, to satisfy NEPA requirements would limit duplicative reviews 
and reduce the amount of delay in the NEPA process. If current 
information is already available as the result of compliance with 
transportation planning requirements, that information should satisfy 
NEPA regulations as well. This would increase efficiency and maintain 
environmental protection. Duplicative reviews serve no redeeming 
purpose as part of the NEPA process, and should be eliminated wherever 
possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="786" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Clear time lines for NEPA reviews: There is no set time limit for 
NEPA decisions. When they begin a NEPA review, project planners have no 
sense of when the process is going to be completed. Strict, enforceable 
timelines for NEPA decisions would add predictability to the NEPA 
process and allow project planners to more accurately plan schedules 
for environmental review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="787" speaker="Mr. Westerman">However, ARTBA recognizes that a uniform deadline may not work for 
every project. In setting NEPA schedules, discussions involving the 
lead agency and project sponsor should take place in order to determine 
a realistic time frame for the project and allow for project-specific 
flexibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="788" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Still More Work to Do</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="789" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Unfortunately, a number of the MAP-21 and FAST Act project reforms 
mentioned do not have many examples upon which to evaluate their 
success. A major reason for this is the uncertainty over long-term 
federal funding. Federal funds, on average, support 52 percent of 
annual state department of transportation capital outlays for highway 
and bridge projects. Uncertainty surrounding the short and long-term 
fiscal condition of the Highway Trust Fund continues to have a 
significant effect on state transportation planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="790" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Following the expiration of MAP-21 and prior to the passage of the 
FAST Act in December 2015, Congress put in place a series of short-term 
program extensions and temporary Highway Trust Fund revenue patches to 
keep highway and public transportation funds flowing to the states. 
This period of uncertainty led DOT officials in 35 states to publicly 
declare their state programs would be impacted by a shutdown of the 
federal surface transportation funds. In fact, eight states delayed or 
canceled projects valued at $1.9 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="791" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The types of projects which require an EIS (and sometimes even an 
EA) are complex, multi-year projects. Without the assurance of long-
term federal funding, states were often reluctant to proceed with such 
projects. With the FAST Act's assurance that federal investment will be 
provided through FY 2020, states will hopefully undertake more long-
term transportation construction projects and we will have a better 
opportunity to witness more project delivery reforms in practice. 
Still, the long-term stability of the Highway Trust Fund needs to be 
addressed to provide states full confidence to undertake large-scale 
new transportation improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="792" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Conclusion</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="793" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The transportation sector has made significant strides in the area 
of project delivery. Beginning with TEA-21 and continuing through to 
the FAST Act, members of both parties have worked together to ensure 
our nation's infrastructure continues to improve at a pace matching the 
growth of our country. Continuing to streamline the NEPA process for 
our nation's infrastructure is essential in assuring the public the 
government is making every dollar spent of transportation go as far as 
possible without sacrificing necessary regulatory safeguards. ARTBA 
looks forward to continuing to work with the Committee on these 
efforts.</paragraph>

  Prepared Statement of the California Agricultural Commissioners and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="795" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Sealers Association by Martin Settevendemie, President</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="796" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva, members of the 
Committee on Natural Resources, thank you for scheduling this important 
hearing on Modernizing National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the 
21st Century. It is important for the Committee to better understand 
the impacts of an outdated NEPA process and the need for reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="797" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Fifty-four California County Agricultural Commissioners and Sealers 
of Weights &amp; Measures are members of the California Agricultural 
Commissioners and Sealers Association (CACASA), a 501 c 6 non-profit 
professional organization. Representing all of California's fifty-eight 
counties, County Agricultural Commissioners and Sealers of Weights and 
Measures have the dual roles of promoting and protecting the state's 
food supply, agricultural trade, the environment, public health and 
safety, consumer confidence and ensuring an equitable marketplace in 
California. California County Agricultural Commissioners and Sealers 
are appointed by their respective County Boards of Supervisors. We work 
cooperatively with California Department of Food and Agriculture and 
Department of Pesticide Regulation, federal and other state agencies, 
and stakeholders to implement regulatory programs at the local level 
ensuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations, ordinances and 
policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="798" speaker="Mr. Westerman">One of our many responsibilities includes working cooperatively 
with Weed Management Areas (WMAs) throughout California. WMAs are made 
up of local stakeholder groups and public and private land management 
entities. WMAs have proven to be an efficient and effective method for 
controlling the spread and impact of invasive plants, including noxious 
weeds throughout California. Left unmanaged invasive plants add to fuel 
loads that if not properly managed can lead to catastrophic wildfires 
and impact their behavior and severity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="799" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The spread of invasive plants in-and-around our nation's national 
forests have an impact on wildfires by constantly changing fuel load 
properties. The recent devastating series of wildfires in Northern 
California that claimed the lives of 43 people, injured hundreds and 
destroyed thousands of buildings and homes were undoubtedly fueled by 
dry vegetation. The wet winter of 2016 and spring of 2017 spurred plant 
growth and this was followed by extreme heat and dry conditions over 
the summer of 2017. This unmanaged, dense fuelbed combined with the 
diablo winds from the northeast to increase the intensity of the fires 
and carried them quickly across the landscape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="800" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The spread of invasive plants can alter ecosystem properties. As 
they do, needed management activities must also be altered to timely 
control the spread. There are multiple management activities that can 
be deployed to reduce risks associated with the potential severity of 
wildfires. Some of those activities include; biological control, 
treatments such as mechanical thinning and prescribed fires, as well as 
herbicide treatments. All activities can help achieve multiple 
management objectives. Last year the USFS reported, ``reduced hazardous 
fuels (activities occurred) on over 3 million acres of National Forest 
System, state, and private lands.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="801" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The varying management activities all come with pros and cons. For 
instance, biological control is a critical element of an integrated 
pest management (IPM) program which can help to reduce herbicide 
applications. However, in some cases professionally applied and 
controlled herbicides may be the only practical consideration for very 
large infestations. Prescribed fires successfully reduce hazardous fuel 
loads but may impact air quality and public safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="802" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Despite the pros and cons there is simply too much at stake, as 
exhibited by the recent northern California fires, to impede management 
activities that reduce hazardous fuels in-and-around our nation's 
forests. In testimony before this Committee in September 2017 witness 
Lawson Fite, American Forest Resource Council testified, ``Our federal 
forests, managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM), urgently need active management to reduce the risk of severe 
wildfire. At least 58 million acres of national forest are at high or 
very high risk of severe wildfire, and over 4.5 million homes are at 
risk.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="803" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The USFS reports that the varying management activities work! More 
than 1,400 hazardous fuel treatments since 2006 have shown that they 
are effective in reducing both the cost and damage from wildfires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="804" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Yet, regulatory, legal and funding impediments exist and projects, 
including those managed by WMA's in California to reduce hazardous fuel 
loads, are continuing to mount. The USFS estimates eleven million acres 
of National Forest System lands located in or near the Wildland Urban 
Interface, where homes and communities are present, would benefit from 
fuel treatments that reduce risks to wildfires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="805" speaker="Mr. Westerman">A more persistent and long-term impediment to the spread of 
invasive plants and management activities to reduce hazardous fuel 
loads in, near National Forests is that most forestry projects are 
subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires 
agencies to complete a detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
for activities ``significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment.'' If activities do not have a significant impact, agencies 
can complete an Environmental Assessment (EA). If proposed management 
activities are: (1) similar to activities that an agency has already 
determined do not have the potential for significant environmental 
impacts, and (2) NEPA procedures are already established for proposed 
management activities, or (3) Statute does not require an agency 
determination for the management activity, a categorical exclusion (CE) 
applies and an EIS and EA are not required.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="806" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Some of the work carried out by the California County Agricultural 
Commissioners has historically taken place on public lands including 
USFS-managed lands. About fifteen years ago, the USFS halted most of 
the work done by the County Agricultural Commissioners because the 
appropriate NEPA documentation had not been completed on many forests. 
Since that time very little NEPA analysis has been completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="807" speaker="Mr. Westerman">California's Sierra Nevada mountains and foothills are a patchwork 
of private and federal lands. Threats such as tree-mortality, 
catastrophic wildfire, and the spread of invasive species do not 
discriminate among landowners or recognize jurisdictional boundaries. 
Counties such as Plumas, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Amador, and 
Calaveras have worked diligently over the last several decades, 
utilizing shoe-string budgets, to stop the spread of invasive weed 
species such as Yellow Starthistle, Spotted Knapweed, and Musk Thistle. 
One of the greatest challenges to the efficacy of these efforts has 
been the ability of local governments to treat invasive weed 
infestations when they occupy both federal and private lands. In many 
instances, the lack of NEPA coverage means that the county agriculture 
department is required to stop otherwise effective treatments (either 
chemical or mechanical) at federal land boundaries, and leave 
populations of invasive weeds untouched on federal lands where they 
reproduce and re-infest the adjoining private lands. In many instances, 
lack of NEPA coverage is the single biggest obstacle to effective 
treatment of invasive weed populations in the Sierra Nevada range.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="808" speaker="Mr. Westerman">According to information highlighted in a Committee on Natural 
Resources Federal Lands Subcommittee hearing earlier this year, the 
federal government does not have a lot of data and analytics on NEPA. 
In an April 2014 report, ``National Environmental Policy Act, Little 
Information Exists on NEPA Analyses,'' the Government Accountability 
Office (GAO), said ``Government-wide data on the number and type of 
most NEPA analyses are not readily available, as data collection 
efforts vary by agency.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="809" speaker="Mr. Westerman">An EIS contains more procedural requirements and more time to 
complete according to the GAO. ``Based on the information published in 
the Federal Register, the National Association of Environmental 
Professionals (NAEP) reported in April 2013 that the 197 final EISs in 
2012 had an average preparation time of 1,675 days, or 4.6 years--the 
highest average EIS preparation time the organization had recorded 
since 1997.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="810" speaker="Mr. Westerman">More recently, the NAEP website shows that in 2016, 312 Draft, 
Final, and Supplemental Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) were 
published in the Federal Register. The Forest Service published the 
most documents with 67 (21% of total), followed by the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers (37/12%), Bureau of Land Management (30/10%), Fish and 
Wildlife Service (18/17%), and Federal Highway Administration (16/5%) 
(based on information in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
database of EISs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="811" speaker="Mr. Westerman">In addition, in their 2016 NEPA Annual Report, NAEP reported that 
``the average time to prepare the 177 Final EISs issued in 2016 
(measured from Notice of Intent to Final EIS) was 5.1 years. This 
continues the recent trend of increasing Final EIS preparation time. 
The average time to prepare the Draft EISs issued in 2016 again showed 
signs of a decreasing trend. Seventeen percent of Final EISs were 
prepared in two years or less, a small increase from 2015.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="812" speaker="Mr. Westerman">We are aware of one project on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest 
requiring an Environmental Analysis that has taken eight years to 
complete. The 100+ acre noxious weed treatment project still has not 
received Final approval. Reasons cited for the delay include lack of 
funding, use of herbicides, adding additional alternatives and re-
prioritizing projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="813" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Preparing an EIS also comes at a cost. In their 2014 Report GAO 
found that the Department of Energy (DOE) tracks the funds it pays 
contractors to prepare NEPA analyses (excluding the time spent by DOE 
employees). ``The average payment to a contractor to prepare an EIS 
from calendar year 2003 through calendar year 2012 was $6.6 million, 
with the range being a low of $60,000 and a high of $85 million.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="814" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Knowing about significant environmental impacts is vital but the 
processes to discover those impacts should not impede progress on 
controlling biological challenges. Invasive plants and grasslands 
continue growing with no regard to a NEPA EIS or EA being completed. 
Any government program dealing with biology and nature that is under-
managed, untimely and/or inconsistently or inadequately funded will 
result in profound consequences. In this case, and as has been 
witnessed in the recent California wildfires, the fires behaved 
differently and burned more intensely and spread quicker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="815" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Only a few National Forest managers in California have completed 
the NEPA analysis required to employ Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
methods for invasive noxious weed control. Multiple statutes have been 
developed over the last sixty years emphasizing the need to control 
invasive species, but little has been done to follow through with NEPA 
completion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="816" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The National Forests surrounding the Tahoe (El Dorado, Lake Tahoe 
Basin MU, Plumas) all have completed invasive plant NEPAs that allow 
them to use herbicides. The Tahoe, despite having significant issues 
with musk thistle, has refused to consider any options other than 
mechanical control. This approach has resulted in a limited success 
over 20+ years of ongoing control projects. If the Tahoe National 
Forest had completed NEPA when musk thistle was first discovered this 
project it would have reduced the significantly burdensome challenge it 
remains today. Instead, there is no end in sight to their continuous 
mechanical control efforts which draw on federal grant monies that 
could be used to fund other projects--and, musk thistle continues to 
spread in eastern Nevada, Sierra, and Placer counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="817" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Sufficient program funding remains a challenge. Many Forest 
supervisors would be willing to proceed with NEPA, but program-specific 
funding has not been made available. We understand this is a more 
broader challenge and Congress and the USFS are working to lessen the 
impact of the practice of fire borrowing which impedes progress in 
other USFS programs such as hazardous fuel reduction and healthy forest 
initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="818" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Another challenge of completing management activities targeted at 
hazardous fuel reductions in/near National Forests is NEPA-origin 
lawsuits. According to the USFS litigation trends nationally for the 
number of cases filed against the Forest Service that contain at least 
one NEPA claim between fiscal year 2012 and 2017 have been relatively 
steady or decreasing slightly. While the number of NEPA-origin lawsuits 
may have slightly reduced in recent years what has not been reduced is 
their broad implications that increasingly obstruct progress of 
projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="819" speaker="Mr. Westerman">For instance, the National Strategy and Implementation Plan for 
Invasive Species Management clearly demands an IPM method for weed 
control and management. Many critical management activities are 
impossible to implement if the USFS does not complete NEPA-authorizing 
IPM treatments such as chemical, mechanical, and biological invasive 
noxious weed control management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="820" speaker="Mr. Westerman">More broadly, in a study published in the January 2014 Journal of 
Forestry, ``Twenty Years of Forest Service Land Management Litigation'' 
(Miner, Malmsheimer and Keele) researchers provided a comprehensive 
analysis of USFS litigation from 1989 to 2008. During this period 
researchers found that ``1,125 land management cases were filed in 
federal court. The Forest Service won 53.8% of these cases, lost 23.3%, 
and settled 22.9%. It won 64.0% of the 669 cases decided by a judge 
based on cases' merits. The agency was more likely to lose and settle 
cases during the last 6 years; the number of cases initiated during 
this time varied greatly. The Pacific Northwest region along with the 
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had the most frequent occurrence of 
cases. Litigants generally challenged vegetative management projects, 
most often by alleging violations of the National Environmental Policy 
Act and the National Forest Management Act. The results document the 
continued influence of the legal system on national forest management 
and describe the complexity of this litigation.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="821" speaker="Mr. Westerman">The reason that litigants challenge vegetative management projects 
based on NEPA is simply because it is easy to do. In their 2014 
``Guidance on Best Practice Principles for Environmental Assessments'' 
report to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the National 
Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP) explain how they 
developed a process to produce Best Practice Principles (BPPs) for 
preparing an effective environmental assessment. One of the first steps 
taken was to prioritize the 535 positive features NEPA practitioners 
identified in a survey as ``features typically associated with adequate 
environmental assessment.'' That's right, 535 positive features for an 
adequate environmental assessment. Likely each one of the 535 features 
is a potential subject for litigation. To their credit the NAEP and CEQ 
are working to prioritize these features down to between 15 and 23 best 
practices for environmental assessments. However, it still leaves a lot 
of interpretations for the U.S. federal court system to settle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="822" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Moreover, NEPA-origin lawsuits do not have to be legally successful 
in court to be successful. NEPA-origin lawsuits are often time-
consuming and add to the burden of an already strained U.S. federal 
court system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="823" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Without the completion of NEPA invasive noxious or non-native weeds 
will continue to proliferate on public and private lands throughout 
California threatening the state's critical infrastructure, its 
biodiversity, and ecological integrity. County Agricultural 
Commissioners (CACs) are also concerned about infestations of serious 
weed species such as Scotch Thistle, Musk Thistle, Leafy and Oblong 
Spurge, Scotch Broom, and Diffuse and Spotted Knapweeds to name just a 
few. These species can seriously reduce the productivity on grazing and 
pasture lands, infest hay fields and timberlands, deplete water 
resources, make recreational areas almost unusable by the public, and 
last but not least displace the very native flora and fauna that the 
U.S. Forest Service is obligated to protect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="824" speaker="Mr. Westerman">There are some modernized practices that if continually undertaken 
can improve upon the challenges to timely completion of environmental 
analyses under NEPA. Two restoration-related categorical exclusions to 
promote hydrologic, aquatic, and landscape restoration were approved in 
2013;
  1.  learning networks are established within the agency to promote</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="825" speaker="Mr. Westerman">adaptive management, focused environmental assessments, and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="826" speaker="Mr. Westerman">iterative environmental impact statements; and
  2.  ``Electronic Management of NEPA'' (eMNEPA) investments have</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="827" speaker="Mr. Westerman">reduced administrative workload by $7 million per year from</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="828" speaker="Mr. Westerman">2005 to 2010 and are projected to save $17 million through</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="829" speaker="Mr. Westerman">2014.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="830" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Implementing the new planning rule and improving NEPA will help 
land managers focus on collaborative watershed restoration while 
promoting jobs and economic opportunities in rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="831" speaker="Mr. Westerman">In addition, more NEPA ``predecisional'' collaborative processes 
should be used with a goal of avoiding litigation. Earlier decisions by 
collaborative partners helps speed the completion of NEPA processes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="832" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Other ideas to modernize the NEPA process include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="833" speaker="Mr. Westerman">&lt;bullet&gt; Incentivize MOU's and project grants for quick</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="834" speaker="Mr. Westerman">implementation of management activities developed by local</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="835" speaker="Mr. Westerman">collaboratives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="836" speaker="Mr. Westerman">&lt;bullet&gt; Provide Categorical Exclusions (CEs) under the National</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="837" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Environmental Policy Act that allow forest management</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="838" speaker="Mr. Westerman">projects to be quickly prepared, analyzed, and implemented.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="889" speaker="Mr. Westerman">and Values</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="890" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Dear Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and Honorable 
Members of the Committee:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="891" speaker="Mr. Westerman">We appreciate the opportunity to provide written comments for the 
Committee's November 29, 2017, hearing on ``Modernizing NEPA for the 
21st Century.'' Please accept these comments for the hearing's official 
record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="892" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Republican President Richard M. Nixon signed the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) into law with bipartisan support in 
1970. NEPA is effective in providing the public and public officials 
with the information we all need to make better decisions. ``Thank God 
for NEPA because there were so many pressures to make a selection for a 
technology that might have been forced upon us and that would have been 
wrong for the country,'' according to then-Secretary of Energy James 
Watkins (ceq.doe.gov/NEPA). Secretary Watkins, a Navy admiral, served 
as Secretary of Energy under Republican President George H.W. Bush. 
NEPA has been a proven bulwark against hasty or wasteful federal 
decisions by fostering government transparency and accountability. It 
has ensured that federal decisions are at their core democratic, by 
guaranteeing meaningful public involvement. It has achieved its stated 
goal of improving the quality of the human environment by relying on 
sound science to reduce and mitigate harmful environmental impacts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="893" speaker="Mr. Westerman">We support strengthening the law, and full funding, to enable fair 
and efficient review under NEPA, including the impact of policies and 
programs on people of color and low income people. This Congress has 
proposed bills that would waive NEPA via legislative categorical 
exclusions, limit the scope of environmental reviews to ignore climate 
impacts, and reduce government accountability to we the people by 
limiting judicial review. These attacks reflect an ideological effort 
to eliminate this law and the legacy of bipartisan support for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="894" speaker="Mr. Westerman">NEPA and other regulations are not the major cause of delay in 
infrastructure development and government decision-making. The 
Congressional Research Service (CRS) identified causes entirely outside 
the NEPA process, such as lack of funding. The U.S. Department of 
Treasury concluded ``a lack of funds is by far the most common 
challenge to completing'' major transportation infrastructure 
projects.\1\

report.pdf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="896" speaker="Mr. Westerman">NEPA plays a vital role in distributing fairly the benefits and 
burdens of environmental policies and programs for all. What the 
environmental justice movement has demonstrated is that racially 
identifiable communities are at a greater risk of environmental harms, 
disproportionately lack environmental benefits, pay a larger cost, and 
carry a heavier environmental burden than other communities regardless 
of income and class. Latinos are among the strongest supporters of 
environmental protection for several major reasons, namely, local 
exposure to pollutants, the effects of climate change and pollution on 
migrant farmworkers, and the impact of global warming on Latin American 
nations. Latinos and other people of color nevertheless are often 
marginalized by public officials, government agencies, mainstream 
environmentalists, and the media.\2\ Proper enforcement of NEPA can 
help address that injustice.

    <paragraph paraId="906" speaker="Mr. Westerman">June 5, 2017</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="907" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Dear Member of Congress:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="908" speaker="Mr. Westerman">On behalf of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement 
(LCLAA), home of the Latino labor movement, we write to strongly oppose 
any and all attacks on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 
NEPA provides our communities a voice in some of the most consequential 
government decisions, impacting where we work, how we work, and even 
the rights and safeguards we have on the job. As Latino workers, we 
play a major role in building and maintaining our nation's 
transportation and energy infrastructure, the same infrastructure that 
allows our country to prosper. In many instances, Latino workers and 
working families bear the brunt of federal projects, making our 
communities most vulnerable to rushed or ill-planned decisions. An 
attack on NEPA is an attack on Latino priorities and our voice, in 
particular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="909" speaker="Mr. Westerman">We represent the interests of over 2 million labor unionists, with 
50 chapters across the United States. Our members include some of the 
most prominent unions in the country, including the United Automobile 
Workers (UAW), the United Steel Workers (USW), the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the Amalgamated 
Transit Union (ATU), the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), 
and the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) 
amongst many others. We recognize that our country is in dire need of 
job-creating infrastructure investment but that investment must be used 
in ways that serve and respond to the needs of the American public. 
This can only happen through a strong and well thought out NEPA 
process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="910" speaker="Mr. Westerman">NEPA provides an important voice for Latino workers and working 
families as we tend to be among the most impacted by federal projects. 
Latino workers account for over 43% of ground, maintenance and 
construction workers and up to 75% of agricultural laborers. Our 
families live, breathe, learn and play in communities next to federally 
funded highways, incinerators, power plants, pipelines, and toxic waste 
sites. How these projects are built and how they are run dictate the 
quality of our health and safety as workers within those facilities as 
well as the health of our families who live near them. We need a say in 
how these projects are developed and NEPA provides it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="911" speaker="Mr. Westerman">We consistently use NEPA's public disclosure mandate to learn about 
how projects are developed and how they will impact our families. We 
use NEPA's public comment opportunities to fight against worker 
exploitation and for safer and healthier work places. We also use it to 
improve the projects with our trade and local expertise. Overall, we 
use NEPA to make projects better; to make jobs better and to keep our 
communities safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="912" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Although NEPA has historically been used to address environmental 
priorities, it is also a tool we use to address related but independent 
issues that impact labor, immigrant, and human rights. For example, 
when a power plant is being developed, we use the NEPA process to 
address workers' safety; when an immigration detention center is 
planned, we use it to address the lack of healthcare for immigrant 
detainees; and when the administration wants to militarize the border 
with a wall, we use it to show how pointless and hateful the idea is. 
NEPA is an environmental protection statute but it is also a civic 
engagement one that we cannot afford to lose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="913" speaker="Mr. Westerman">We are concerned by the increasing volume of attacks on this 
critical law. In each of the last three Congresses, we have seen over 
160 bills that undermine NEPA by shortening public comment periods and 
statutes of limitation, establishing arbitrary deadlines for 
environmental review, limiting the consideration of better alternatives 
or waiving the law altogether. All in all, these harmful measures give 
industry a green light to recklessly build projects without addressing 
or even considering how Latino workers, their families, and countless 
communities of color will be impacted or disenfranchised in the 
process. We ask that you protect and recognize our right to 
meaningfully participate in the national infrastructure development 
process by defending NEPA and all the safeguards it guarantees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="914" speaker="Mr. Westerman">Therefore, as the home of the Latino labor movement, we urge you to 
oppose any efforts that threaten to undermine our voice in government 
decisions. We, the workers who contribute so much everyday to building 
and maintaining our national infrastructure urge you to protect our 
voice in government. Protect NEPA!</paragraph>
