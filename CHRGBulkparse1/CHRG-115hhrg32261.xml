    <info>    The Helsinki process, formally titled the Conference on Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe, traces its origin to the signing of the </info>
    <info>Helsinki Final Act in Finland on August 1, 1975, by the leaders of 33 </info>
    <info>European countries, the United States and Canada. As of January 1, </info>
    <info>1995, the Helsinki process was renamed the Organization for Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The membership of the OSCE has </info>
    <info>expanded to 56 participating States, reflecting the breakup of the </info>
    <info>Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.</info>
    <info>    The OSCE Secretariat is in Vienna, Austria, where weekly meetings </info>
    <info>of the participating States' permanent representatives are held. In </info>
    <info>addition, specialized seminars and meetings are convened in various </info>
    <info>locations. Periodic consultations are held among Senior Officials, </info>
    <info>Ministers and Heads of State or Government.</info>
    <info>    Although the OSCE continues to engage in standard setting in the </info>
    <info>fields of military security, economic and environmental cooperation, </info>
    <info>and human rights and humanitarian concerns, the Organization is </info>
    <info>primarily focused on initiatives designed to prevent, manage and </info>
    <info>resolve conflict within and among the participating States. The </info>
    <info>Organization deploys numerous missions and field activities located in </info>
    <info>Southeastern and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The </info>
    <info>website of the OSCE is: &lt;www.osce.org&gt;.</info>
    <info>    The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as </info>
    <info>the Helsinki Commission, is a U.S. Government agency created in 1976 to </info>
    <info>monitor and encourage compliance by the participating States with their </info>
    <info>OSCE commitments, with a particular emphasis on human rights.</info>
    <info>    The Commission consists of nine members from the United States </info>
    <info>Senate, nine members from the House of Representatives, and one member </info>
    <info>each from the Departments of State, Defense and Commerce. The positions </info>
    <info>of Chair and Co-Chair rotate between the Senate and House every two </info>
    <info>years, when a new Congress convenes. A professional staff assists the </info>
    <info>Commissioners in their work.</info>
    <info>    In fulfilling its mandate, the Commission gathers and disseminates </info>
    <info>relevant information to the U.S. Congress and the public by convening </info>
    <info>hearings, issuing reports that reflect the views of Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission and/or its staff, and providing details about the activities </info>
    <info>of the Helsinki process and developments in OSCE participating States.</info>
    <info>    The Commission also contributes to the formulation and execution of </info>
    <info>U.S. policy regarding the OSCE, including through Member and staff </info>
    <info>participation on U.S. Delegations to OSCE meetings. Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission have regular contact with parliamentarians, government </info>
    <info>officials, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and </info>
    <info>private individuals from participating States. The website of the </info>
    <info>Commission is: &lt;www.csce.gov&gt;.</info>

    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Okay. Good afternoon and welcome to this briefing of </info>
    <info>the U.S. Helsinki Commission.</info>
    <info>    The commission is mandated to monitor compliance with international </info>
    <info>rules and standards across Europe, which include military affairs, </info>
    <info>economic and environmental issues, and human rights and democracy.</info>
    <info>    My name is Paul Massaro and I am the policy advisor responsible for </info>
    <info>economic and environmental issues, including illicit trade.</info>
    <info>    I would like to welcome you today on behalf of our bipartisan and </info>
    <info>bicameral leadership to discuss an underexamined threat to the national </info>
    <info>security of the United States: free-trade zones, or FTZs. FTZs are </info>
    <info>duty-free areas within a country's borders designed to encourage </info>
    <info>economic development by allowing goods to be imported and exported </info>
    <info>under less restrictive conditions than are present elsewhere in the </info>
    <info>country.</info>
    <info>    In many places, these zones generate jobs and wealth. However, they </info>
    <info>are also hospitable to illicit trade and money laundering. In the worst </info>
    <info>cases, law enforcement fails and FTZs become global hubs of criminal </info>
    <info>activity, black holes that enable corruption.</info>
    <info>    For all the prosperity that globalization has generated, corruption </info>
    <info>is consuming an ever-greater share of these gains. In order to enrich </info>
    <info>themselves, transnational criminal networks have found innovative ways </info>
    <info>to exploit otherwise productive technologies and governance frameworks </info>
    <info>to flout international rules and standards. This has led to a flood of </info>
    <info>dangerous counterfeits and contraband into U.S. and European markets, a </info>
    <info>spike in wealth inequality as ill-gotten gains are distributed among a </info>
    <info>handful of bosses, and a besiegement of the rule of law as authorities </info>
    <info>struggle to keep up.</info>
    <info>    As these criminals have become more sophisticated, their political </info>
    <info>influence has increased. In many cases, transnational criminal networks </info>
    <info>have become so effective at manipulating globalization that they have </info>
    <info>fused with the government, capturing the state and turning it to their </info>
    <info>devious ends. This brand of authoritarianism based on globalized </info>
    <info>corruption, or kleptocracy as we've come to call it, poses a major </info>
    <info>national security threat to the United States as the country finds </info>
    <info>itself economically entangled with autocratic powers that have no </info>
    <info>intention of playing by the rules.</info>
    <info>    These powers have wasted no time weaponizing corruption and </info>
    <info>deploying it as their primary tool of foreign policy. By strategically </info>
    <info>placing authoritarian capital, kleptocracies are able to, one, </info>
    <info>influence operations, engage in reputation laundering, and gain access </info>
    <info>to and leverage over elites. While many of the vulnerabilities that </info>
    <info>enable this weaponization of corruption have become a focus of the </info>
    <info>Washington policy community, in particular the national security threat </info>
    <info>posed by anonymous shell companies, others have remained out of the </info>
    <info>limelight. Free-trade zones fall squarely into this category.</info>
    <info>    We have a truly distinguished panel here today to help us </info>
    <info>understand the role of FTZs, how they are being exploited by criminal </info>
    <info>actors, and what action can be taken. Speaking first we have Dr. Clay </info>
    <info>Fuller to my left, the American Enterprise Institute Jeane Kirkpatrick </info>
    <info>fellow. He is a leading light in understanding the corruption </info>
    <info>authoritarianism nexus and will set the stage by providing us his </info>
    <info>insights.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Fuller, thank you so much for joining us today.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Fuller. Do you want me to go?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Not just yet. [Chuckles.]</info>
    <info>    We will then hear from Jack Radisch, senior project manager with </info>
    <info>the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, </info>
    <info>High-Level Risk Forum. Jack is here all the way from Paris to discuss </info>
    <info>all the good work the OECD's Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade has </info>
    <info>been doing on FTZs.</info>
    <info>    I also want to welcome Stephane Jacobzone, who we've got at the </info>
    <info>front table with us today. He is the deputy head of the Division of </info>
    <info>Public Governance at the OECD, so also from Paris.</info>
    <info>    Thank you so much for joining us, Stephane.</info>
    <info>    So glad that you both could be here.</info>
    <info>    Finally, we will hear from Pedro Assares Rodrigues, Europol's </info>
    <info>representative here in Washington. As the EU's police cooperation body, </info>
    <info>Europol is well aware of the complexities regarding transnational </info>
    <info>criminal networks in the 21st century. Pedro will speak to Europol's </info>
    <info>efforts to combat illicit trade, including through FTZs, and the need </info>
    <info>for transatlantic cooperation to take on globalized corruption.</info>
    <info>    Pedro, thanks so much for joining us.</info>
    <info>    With that, I will hand it over to Dr. Fuller.</info>
    <info>    Thanks so much. The floor is yours.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Fuller. All right. Thank you very much, Paul.</info>
    <info>    So thank you to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in </info>
    <info>Europe for inviting me here today to provide a few comments on the use </info>
    <info>of foreign trade zones in this superbly named briefing, ``Free-Trade </info>
    <info>Zones: Productive or Destructive?''</info>
    <info>    I have given my comments a clever name as well: ``More Data on </info>
    <info>FTZs, Please?'' [Laughter.] My British and Panamanian friends would </info>
    <info>know that I like to say SOPs for the FTZs also, but I'm going to talk </info>
    <info>here about a more nuanced and objective way of thinking about </info>
    <info>transparency. And there's two points that I'm going to make about this </info>
    <info>in the context of the FTZs.</info>
    <info>    So there needs to be more and better aggregate data on free-trade </info>
    <info>zones around the world. Private and public sector actors that use and </info>
    <info>study free-trade zones can be instrumental in pushing governments to </info>
    <info>report more standardized and higher-quality data on zones.</info>
    <info>    We've known for years that things like corruption, illicit trade, </info>
    <info>illicit finance are huge issues within free-trade zones around the </info>
    <info>world. The law enforcement community, large multinational corporations, </info>
    <info>environmental protection groups, journalists and labor rights </info>
    <info>organizations are keenly aware of the issues, but they seem to be stuck </info>
    <info>without a way to move forward. So thanks to the hard work of the OECD, </info>
    <info>we now have some preliminary empirical evidence that free-trade zones </info>
    <info>do play a significant role in the trafficking of counterfeit goods </info>
    <info>specifically, but further research and better data are needed.</info>
    <info>    During the last year at the American Enterprise Institute, I have </info>
    <info>written extensively on issues of kleptocracy, authoritarianism, </info>
    <info>corruption, illicit trade and illicit finance. As I emphasized at the </info>
    <info>last Helsinki Commission meeting on illicit trade specifically, I want </info>
    <info>to reiterate the idea that in all anticorruption efforts, including </info>
    <info>fighting illicit trade and illicit finance, groups interested in </info>
    <info>reforming FTZs would do well to define not just what they are fighting </info>
    <info>against, but what it is they are fighting for.</info>
    <info>    So if we define corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for </info>
    <info>private gain, then its natural opposite, or in other words what we </info>
    <info>should be fighting for, is the use of earned power for public gain. </info>
    <info>This begs the question, how do we fight for the use of earned power for </info>
    <info>public gain? Well, the answer is transparency. But not in the classic </info>
    <info>sunlight, disinfectant, investigative or activist sense that we usually </info>
    <info>think of the term ``transparency'' in.</info>
    <info>    Transparency can be thought of very simply as the credible </info>
    <info>reporting of aggregate economic data to the public. So think about the </info>
    <info>important roles of aggregate data, like job growth numbers, </info>
    <info>unemployment and GDP growth--transparency defined objectively as </info>
    <info>credible aggregate economic data is a crucial public good that </info>
    <info>governments are best suited to provide, but crucially requires help </info>
    <info>from the private sector in order to collect and define the concepts </info>
    <info>needed to measure it.</info>
    <info>    Similar to how a lighthouse provides data to incoming ships in a </info>
    <info>storm or polling and elections provide signals of grievances and policy </info>
    <info>shifts, credible aggregate FTZ data can act as a coordination good </info>
    <info>amongst a host of public and private actors, including businesses, </info>
    <info>financial institutions and law enforcement agencies.</info>
    <info>    The U.S. Government is currently one of the best in the world when </info>
    <info>it comes to reporting aggregate data. But in my opinion, it utterly </info>
    <info>fails when it comes to its own FTZs. For example, I cannot find a </info>
    <info>credible number of how many active FTZs we have in the United States. </info>
    <info>My best guess at this point is that it's somewhere between 176 and 250. </info>
    <info>So in fact, the entire world utterly fails at publishing these data. </info>
    <info>The number of FTZs globally is typically estimated by experts to be </info>
    <info>somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000. I think we can do much better than </info>
    <info>that. So the first point of problems in reporting data, problems with </info>
    <info>FTZ data stem from the simple measurement issues that are made </info>
    <info>inordinately complex due to a lack of standardization around the world. </info>
    <info>The most basic problem that we can get to is in simply counting zones.</info>
    <info>    So no definitive number of zones exists because they are called </info>
    <info>different things in different places. In China, in Dubai, they are </info>
    <info>often called special economic zones. In the United States, they are </info>
    <info>called foreign-trade zones. And elsewhere, they are called free-trade </info>
    <info>zones or export-processing zones or industrial parks or a host of other </info>
    <info>names. Furthermore, there's even more questions. Should we count things </info>
    <info>like subzones and operators? Should we count the number of firms? </info>
    <info>Should we count the number of employees, square kilometers or the </info>
    <info>volumes of trade? Or should we categorize zones by the economic sectors </info>
    <info>that they service?</info>
    <info>    My point is that while complex questions exist, these are far from </info>
    <info>insurmountable and they can be easily overcome by the national </info>
    <info>governments that write these zones into laws and with the help of the </info>
    <info>firms that operate within them, through simple standardization and </info>
    <info>reporting mechanisms.</info>
    <info>    To date, other than the data I have personally collected and </info>
    <info>analyzed on trade zones around the world, only the World Bank and the </info>
    <info>OECD have attempted systematic global studies of the effects of these </info>
    <info>zones. These are great and informative studies, but what I'm saying is </info>
    <info>that to make these studies better there needs to be better and </info>
    <info>standardized national-level data.</info>
    <info>    So the last point--pushing for better data. Credible reporting of </info>
    <info>aggregate economic data is transparency. Transparency in this objective </info>
    <info>sense is good for both economic growth and the rule of law. For the </info>
    <info>private sector, it's the term ``aggregate'' that's key, right, because </info>
    <info>private firms are rightly jealous of their privacy. Without it, </info>
    <info>competitors and bad actors will find ways to use and abuse their data </info>
    <info>to gain an unfair advantage and perpetuate further criminal activities. </info>
    <info>But there's no harm done in asking national governments to clearly </info>
    <info>define, count and report basic aggregate information on zones to the </info>
    <info>public. There are a host of ways in which this can be done while still </info>
    <info>protecting the privacy of firms located within the zones.</info>
    <info>    Now, for governments and law enforcement agencies, the term </info>
    <info>``credible'' is key here. In order for transparency to work as a public </info>
    <info>good, it has to be credible. To use my previous examples, a lighthouse </info>
    <info>is only as valuable as it is dependable, a poll is only as reliable as </info>
    <info>it is scientific and an election is only as valuable as it is free and </info>
    <info>fair. But governments around the world are currently facing credibility </info>
    <info>issues across the board, and I would argue that this is partly due to a </info>
    <info>lack of transparency in this objective sense.</info>
    <info>    Foreign-trade zones, I think, are a great place to start building </info>
    <info>back trust between the private and public sector because, one, they are </info>
    <info>relatively small; two, they are geographically delineated to specific </info>
    <info>areas; and three, because of these previous two points they are </info>
    <info>theoretically more easily monitored jointly by public and private </info>
    <info>entities.</info>
    <info>    In the almost 10 years of studying and following the use of FTZs </info>
    <info>worldwide, it's become my view that there is no more pragmatic way to </info>
    <info>promote lasting economic growth free of the corruption that feeds </info>
    <info>economic inequality, organized crime, illegal immigration and a host of </info>
    <info>other complex issues than to report more credible aggregate economic </info>
    <info>data on foreign-trade zones.</info>
    <info>    So the work of the OECD is an important first step and it </info>
    <info>establishes a solid baseline for understanding and working around these </info>
    <info>issues concerning FTZs. However, improving transparency of foreign-</info>
    <info>trade zones will require bottom-up, private/public pressure on national </info>
    <info>governments to publish better data. Then once leading national </info>
    <info>governments develop these aggregate data, it is up to them to persuade </info>
    <info>their trading partners to standardize and share these aggregate data </info>
    <info>with each other to act as a coordinated public good.</info>
    <info>    Ultimately, without a clearer picture of how the world free-trade </info>
    <info>zones work and their effects, public and private sector initiatives to </info>
    <info>minimize their subversion by criminal elements will remain futile.</info>
    <info>    Thank you for your time and I look forward to any questions.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Thank you very much, Dr. Fuller. I'm so happy you also </info>
    <info>were impressed with the OECD's work on free-trade zones. That's why we </info>
    <info>invited them here today.</info>
    <info>    So with that, I'd like to hand the floor to Jack and Stephane to </info>
    <info>talk about that very work.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Radisch. Thank you very much, Paul.</info>
    <info>    And thank you very much to the Helsinki Commission for this </info>
    <info>invitation to present some of the OECD's findings related to free-trade </info>
    <info>zones.</info>
    <info>    I'd like first to just contextualize that research that we're doing </info>
    <info>on free-trade zones. It's not to look at the economic benefits, which </info>
    <info>are undoubtable in many cases. Our research is focusing on the role of </info>
    <info>free-trade zones pertaining to illicit trade. And that's the topic of </info>
    <info>our panel today, and so that drives very much the approach we take and </info>
    <info>the information that we gather and analyze with regard to free-trade </info>
    <info>zones.</info>
    <info>    The Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade at the OECD was set up </info>
    <info>to study, to map, to quantify different sectors of illicit trade. And </info>
    <info>some of you might be familiar with the work that we've done on </info>
    <info>counterfeit trade. That's an area where we actually have a high level </info>
    <info>of confidence in our estimates of the quantity and the flows of that </info>
    <info>sector of illicit trade. The OECD estimated that up to $461 billion is </info>
    <info>conducted in trade in fakes based on the years that we studied. And </info>
    <info>we'll continue that research next year with updated years of data so we </info>
    <info>can begin to compare and see if there's any trends that emerge. For </info>
    <info>now, we have pictures over a couple of different years successively. </info>
    <info>But $461 billion in trade in fakes is a lot of money. And where does </info>
    <info>that money go, but oftentimes recycling into the criminal hands behind </info>
    <info>these criminal enterprises.</info>
    <info>    And we analyzed through trade data and seizure data the flows of </info>
    <info>that trade in fakes. And we noticed that oftentimes it's going through </info>
    <info>free-trade zones. So that led us on to another line of inquiry to </info>
    <info>analyze the correlation between free-trade zones and the trade in </info>
    <info>global fakes.</info>
    <info>    So I'd like to ask my colleague Stephane to say about a few of the </info>
    <info>findings on the economic impacts and correlations in that report.</info>
    <info>    And also, we have more recent reports on the conditions that </info>
    <info>attract the trade in fakes.</info>
    <info>    Stephane.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Jacobzone. Yes, thank you very much, Jack.</info>
    <info>    I just wanted to say that the OECD is an economic cooperation set </info>
    <info>up after World War II to promote economic cooperation among nations. </info>
    <info>It's part of the George Marshall Plan, is heavily committed to </info>
    <info>transparency.</info>
    <info>    And the work we are presenting today is part of our work to step up </info>
    <info>global anticorruption efforts that we do in partnership with the U.K.--</info>
    <info>I see some of our colleagues here--with the U.S. and also this work on </info>
    <info>free-trade zones in partnership with the European Union Intellectual </info>
    <info>Property Office.</info>
    <info>    So what are we looking at? We are in fact looking at governance </info>
    <info>gaps. These are the sort of grease of globalizations because </info>
    <info>globalization is meant to be good for everyone. But there are people </info>
    <info>who can see the gaps who make enormous profits above this sort of </info>
    <info>benign neglect, or blind-eyes policy, where people can let things go </info>
    <info>just as they are so that you can maximize profits.</info>
    <info>    What we found--and you are very right, Dr. Fuller, to say that </info>
    <info>there is no standardized data on the free-trade zones, because to do </info>
    <info>our work we had to rely on some academic databases--because academics' </info>
    <info>interest in the topic have had armies of students and people </info>
    <info>researching the facts, that gave us a database of nearly 3,000 free-</info>
    <info>trade zones. It may not be exhaustive, but sufficient to get good </info>
    <info>statistical results. And that's how we built our results.</info>
    <info>    And when we did our analysis, we did find that for nearly each </info>
    <info>additional free-trade zone in the country, I think the propensity to </info>
    <info>export free goods in that country would jump by, let's say, 5 or 6 </info>
    <info>percent. So that was a statistical, proven link between the increasing </info>
    <info>numbers of free-trade zones and the propensity to export fake goods. </info>
    <info>And that's part of a general analysis where we look at governance gaps.</info>
    <info>    And we see that countries where there are, let's say, sufficient </info>
    <info>production capacities, logistics capacities, the ability to facilitate </info>
    <info>shipments and trade flows, but which at the same time do not have the </info>
    <info>same governance standards as, let's say, a country such as the United </info>
    <info>States, have become the hubs of the dark economy globally and can be </info>
    <info>used by traffickers to shape counterfeit products.</info>
    <info>    We have another related publication on why do countries export fake </info>
    <info>goods.</info>
    <info>    And then you would say, what do you do with that? You have to do </info>
    <info>something. You have to get some form of a joint effort by nations to </info>
    <info>step up the pressure. And with Jack, we have also been developing some </info>
    <info>form of a guidance which in the future--at least the countries inside </info>
    <info>the OECD to start with, which represents at least still 50 or 60 </info>
    <info>percent of the global economy--would commit to monitor, track and </info>
    <info>publish information on their free-trade zones--answering to your </info>
    <info>comment--and where we would also invite the free-trade zones to adopt </info>
    <info>codes of conduct so that free-trade zones means, okay, you are duty </info>
    <info>free, you don't pay taxes, you have a good environment for business, </info>
    <info>but it doesn't mean that you are not subject to any checks, for example </info>
    <info>customs check, and so that we can sort of detect any illegal activity </info>
    <info>that would go through you. So that's the sort of effort that we are </info>
    <info>pushing through.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Radisch. And if I can follow up on that, because we've </info>
    <info>conducted this empirical work, we've seen that there really is a </info>
    <info>problem going through the free-trade zones. It's not just anecdotes, </info>
    <info>it's not just a hunch--we've shown this correlation. And the question </info>
    <info>really is what to do about it. And yet, many of these economies do </info>
    <info>depend on free-trade zones for their economic benefits. Not all of them </info>
    <info>have panned out the way they might have anticipated. And the question </info>
    <info>is what to do about the illicit trade that's going through some of </info>
    <info>them. And this is the work that Stephane is referring to.</info>
    <info>    Through the OECD, we're developing a standard that would be helpful </info>
    <info>to law enforcement around the world to have a better idea of what's </info>
    <info>going on inside particular zones at any given time. So talking about </info>
    <info>information requirements, this is not focused on the, say, the economic </info>
    <info>benefits or the employment gains, but rather what merchandise, what </info>
    <info>consignments are coming in and going out, who owns the merchandise, </info>
    <info>where is it going.</info>
    <info>    The idea is to have a situational awareness of what's present </info>
    <info>inside a free-trade zone at any given moment so that when there's an </info>
    <info>investigation on the premises, it can really make a difference. This </info>
    <info>doesn't add up on what the audit trail points, that there is a </info>
    <info>discrepancy on what the inventory says. And this is the type of </info>
    <info>information that the law enforcement community and customs need in </info>
    <info>order to fight this scourge.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Thanks so much, Jack and Stephane. And thank you for </info>
    <info>all the data you've been collecting, your good work, and also </info>
    <info>specifically for highlighting the work you've been doing on developing </info>
    <info>guidance. I think at the end of the day when we're looking at results </info>
    <info>and policy, that's going to be extremely helpful. And you mention that </info>
    <info>that would be very helpful to law enforcement.</info>
    <info>    Well, it just so happens we have a law enforcement representative </info>
    <info>at the table, so I'd like to hand it over to Pedro now to speak to </info>
    <info>Europol.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Rodrigues. Thanks so much, Paul, for the floor. And thank you </info>
    <info>also to the Helsinki Commission for the invitation addressed to </info>
    <info>Europol.</info>
    <info>    So, indeed, my name is Pedro Assares. I'm one of Europol's liaison </info>
    <info>officers here to Washington, and just to tell you a little bit about </info>
    <info>Europol, to provide you some context on what we do and who we are, </info>
    <info>Europol was created in 1992 as a European drugs unit, and since then we </info>
    <info>have evolved into dealing with serious and organized crime, terrorism, </info>
    <info>and all other forms of criminality that affect the European Union's </info>
    <info>interests. And within these interests, obviously, we include fraud, </info>
    <info>counterfeiting, money laundering--so all the criminal activities that </info>
    <info>basically are connected, as we have heard before, to free-trade zones.</info>
    <info>    Europol's main role is actually to support its member states, the </info>
    <info>member states in the European Union and other partners we work with, in </info>
    <info>preventing and combating crime, and we do it by basically acting as a </info>
    <info>central information hub. We host a large database of criminal entities </info>
    <info>of various different natures, and we also provide our partners with an </info>
    <info>information exchange platform. We have one system which is called SIENA </info>
    <info>that is basically connecting all the 28 European member states plus all </info>
    <info>the countries and international organizations that we have agreements </info>
    <info>with. Obviously the U.S. is also included in this group of partners. We </info>
    <info>also provide analytical and operational support, and we have </info>
    <info>specialized teams that deal with this type of criminality.</info>
    <info>    And to mention the last very particular characteristic of Europol </info>
    <info>which makes us, I would say, unique, is our network of liaison </info>
    <info>officers. So we have between 220 and 230 liaison officers in house, </info>
    <info>based in The Hague, where Europol is headquartered. And basically this </info>
    <info>network of liaison officers allows all the countries and organizations </info>
    <info>represented at Europol to interact directly in real time. So if I have </info>
    <info>an issue on counterfeiting, and it's involving my own country and </info>
    <info>another country across the world--the U.S., for example--I can just go </info>
    <info>up one floor or go down one floor, knock on the door of that specific </info>
    <info>liaison officer and basically ask a question.</info>
    <info>    The majority of times liaison officers have direct access to their </info>
    <info>databases--national databases, so it can just be a matter of asking a </info>
    <info>question and getting an immediate answer. Other times they just need to </info>
    <info>basically relay the questions back home, and it will be dealt with by </info>
    <info>law enforcement agencies in this case, or by customs authorities also </info>
    <info>in what relates to this conference today.</info>
    <info>    Just to give you an idea of our interaction with the U.S., we have </info>
    <info>around 25 U.S. liaison officers based permanently in The Hague, within </info>
    <info>the building, and we have them from 10 different Federal agencies, so </info>
    <info>just to name a few--I have a list because there are quite a few. So </info>
    <info>ATF, CBP with direct intervention in free-trade zones, DEA, Defense </info>
    <info>Security Service, FBI, FDA, ICE, IRS, the Secret Service, TSA, and also </info>
    <info>the NYPD is represented at Europol.</info>
    <info>    Cooperation with the U.S. began in 2001 with the signature of a </info>
    <info>strategic agreement, and the year after, in 2002, we signed an </info>
    <info>operational agreement with the U.S. and with its agencies that allows </info>
    <info>Europol basically to exchange information and to allow for a platform </info>
    <info>for member states to exchange information with the U.S. as well, and </info>
    <info>also to provide mutual support for each other's high-priority </info>
    <info>investigations in this case.</info>
    <info>    I can say that the cooperation between the U.S. and the EU is a </info>
    <info>success story; it has been increasing ever since it began. In recent </info>
    <info>years, for unfortunate reasons--so as a result of the terrorist attacks </info>
    <info>in the EU, there has been more and more information exchanged, and the </info>
    <info>core criminal areas where Europol actually interacts with the U.S. are </info>
    <info>counterterrorism, citizen organized crime, cybercrime, and also illegal </info>
    <info>immigration since 2015 with the advent of the migration crisis that </info>
    <info>existed in Europe.</info>
    <info>    I would also call attention to the TFTP program. Free-trade zones--</info>
    <info>although I'm not an expert in the matter; my area of expertise is </info>
    <info>different, but I've done some reading, and there are suspicions that </info>
    <info>free-trade zones could act as a platform for financing terrorism. So </info>
    <info>there is a big component of cooperation between the U.S. and the EU on </info>
    <info>financing of terrorism. We have a terrorist financing tracking program </info>
    <info>in place which basically keeps the liaison bureau here in the U.S., </info>
    <info>actually, and we occupy it as part of our daily business to exchange </info>
    <info>information on this kind of topic.</info>
    <info>    I made mention to SIENA, the Secure Information Exchange Network </info>
    <info>Application--so the information exchange system that Europol has in </info>
    <info>place is also connected here to the U.S., and this has been a major </info>
    <info>advantage. It allows law enforcement agencies to interact with U.S. law </info>
    <info>enforcement agencies very directly, securely, without even the need to </info>
    <info>involve Europol, for example. So if there is a need to reach out to any </info>
    <info>state, local, national law enforcement, customs authorities as well, </info>
    <info>this channel can be used directly to exchange information.</info>
    <info>    Going into a bit more specifically on free-trade zones, basically </info>
    <info>they are being described as an environment with few inspections and </info>
    <info>large cargo coming in and out, and as such, fertile ground for criminal </info>
    <info>activity, for organized crime groups to take advantage of these relaxed </info>
    <info>procedures, I would say, or controlled procedures to basically just </info>
    <info>make profits and, again, take advantage of some measures that were </info>
    <info>meant to boost economic growth. As any other low-risk and high-reward </info>
    <info>situation, it's easily identified by organized crime groups, and they </info>
    <info>will obviously take advantage of it and try to make their own profits </info>
    <info>out of it. So Europol's response to this type of criminality is </info>
    <info>basically delivered by three main clusters: the fraud cluster, the </info>
    <info>counterfeiting cluster, and the financial intelligence cluster.</info>
    <info>    We do have one operations department which has five different </info>
    <info>subunits, so we have one information central hub which is the gateway </info>
    <info>for all the information that reaches Europol. We have a serious and </info>
    <info>organized crime center, we have a cybercrime center, we have a </info>
    <info>counterterrorism center, and we have horizontal operational support </info>
    <info>where financial intelligence is included. The other two, fraud and </info>
    <info>counterfeiting, are part of the serious and organized crime unit, and </info>
    <info>there are two specific teams within the fraud cluster which are of </info>
    <info>relevance for today's discussion, which are Apate, which is dealing </info>
    <info>with fraud, and in this case with special relevance in fake invoice </info>
    <info>fraud. Then we have Smoke, which as the name suggests, deals with </info>
    <info>cigarette smuggling. Then we have another team called Copy within the </info>
    <info>counterfeiting cluster, and basically they deal directly with </info>
    <info>counterfeiting, and then a team called Sustrans--that's short for </info>
    <info>suspicious transactions. Colleagues there deal with money laundering </info>
    <info>and trying to detect and disrupt criminal cash flows which are linked </info>
    <info>to organized crime.</info>
    <info>    To know more on Europol's take on free-trade zones, I would invite </info>
    <info>you to read a joint report between Europol and the European Union </info>
    <info>Intellectual Property Office that was drafted in 2017. \1\ It's a </info>
    <info>situation report on counterfeiting and piracy in the EU, and it </info>
    <info>basically contains a section which is topic-specific to free-trade </info>
    <info>zones, and it highlights that this remains a threat in the </info>
    <info>counterfeiting landscape in the EU, mainly for the reasons that were </info>
    <info>highlighted by the previous panelists, but also highlights that this </info>
    <info>type of criminality is linked with other forms of organized crime such </info>
    <info>as drugs trafficking, excise fraud, human trafficking and human </info>
    <info>smuggling, document fraud, corruption, and so on.</info>
    <info>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</info>
    <info>\1\  https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/2017-</info>
    <info>situation-report-counterfeiting-and-piracy-in-european-union</info>
    <info>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</info>
    <info>    So what is being done at the European level that Europol is either </info>
    <info>participating in or trying to show some initiative in? In 2016, in </info>
    <info>July, Europol launched--together again with the European Union </info>
    <info>Intellectual Property Office--the Intellectual Property Crime </info>
    <info>Coordinated Coalition--which is a really long name and acronym--and has </info>
    <info>a sister organization based in the U.S. But mainly the intention was to </info>
    <info>provide operational and technical support to law enforcement agencies </info>
    <info>within the European Union on cross-border investigations in regard to </info>
    <info>counterfeiting, but it also served the purpose of monitoring new trends </info>
    <info>and emerging criminal--or modus operandi in relation to counterfeiting </info>
    <info>and piracy as well.</info>
    <info>    There is also something else to highlight: The existence of an </info>
    <info>enforcement database, which is integrated with Europol and with the </info>
    <info>European Anti-Fraud Office, and because it is built on existing </info>
    <info>European databases on trademark information and registered designs, it </info>
    <info>allows customs authorities and national police authorities basically to </info>
    <info>access information or to view information on products' details, and </info>
    <info>actually makes it easier to spot counterfeits and to take the necessary </info>
    <info>and subsequent action.</info>
    <info>    I would finally just also mention Europol hosts an online platform </info>
    <info>for experts which has a number of different sub-platforms on different </info>
    <info>types of criminality, and one of those is called Customs Enforcement, </info>
    <info>and it's basically just an online secure platform where customs </info>
    <info>authorities and other types of law enforcement can apply for membership </info>
    <info>and discuss or exchange non-operational information on this platform at </info>
    <info>different levels--at the national level, at the Customs Cooperation </info>
    <info>Working Party level, or at the World Customs Organization level. So </info>
    <info>basically it's a restrictive online group that can be accessible by </info>
    <info>request. It allows for sharing knowledge, sharing best practices, </info>
    <info>information, statistics, if necessary--so it's an interesting platform </info>
    <info>for information exchange.</info>
    <info>    And this basically concludes my intervention, and I'm happy to take </info>
    <info>any questions.</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Thank you very much, Pedro, for the insights into how </info>
    <info>Europol is approaching this problem.</info>
    <info>    I'll say I think everybody in this room and everybody at the table, </info>
    <info>we want to make sure that law enforcement has the tools it needs and </info>
    <info>the data it needs to take this problem on, so having you at the table </info>
    <info>is really meaningful. Thanks for coming today.</info>
    <info>    So we'll go ahead and move into the Q&amp;A session, so go ahead and </info>
    <info>think of your questions. I'm going to ask a couple, and then we'll open </info>
    <info>it up to the public.</info>
    <info>    My first one is for OECD, Jack and Stephane. I was hoping you might </info>
    <info>be able to speak a little bit to the kinds of items you find in free-</info>
    <info>trade zones--what kind of goods are trafficked and how that impacts the </info>
    <info>United States and the transatlantic sphere.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Radisch. Sure.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Thanks.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Radisch. I'll say a few words about what kinds of goods, and </info>
    <info>then maybe Stefane--if you could say how it impacts the U.S. economy, </info>
    <info>if you have that data stored away up here, but otherwise you'll find </info>
    <info>it.</info>
    <info>    First of all, when it comes to counterfeits, anything that can be </info>
    <info>counterfeited and that you can make a profit on, you're going to find </info>
    <info>it. It really spans the full range of harmonized system [HS] codes. But </info>
    <info>I think an important point here to make today is, it's not just trade </info>
    <info>in counterfeits in free-trade zones. Now that's where we are data rich. </info>
    <info>And of course the OECD is an organization where we want to give advice </info>
    <info>to governments that is evidence based; it is data driven.</info>
    <info>    We have hundreds of thousands of data points on counterfeits. Now </info>
    <info>that doesn't mean there isn't other types of illegal goods going </info>
    <info>through these free-trade zones. It just means we have a lot less </info>
    <info>evidence and data on it because really they are based on cases, </info>
    <info>investigations, anecdotes, our interviews, but that's not the kind of </info>
    <info>information that is gathered in trade data. But for example, wildlife, </info>
    <info>arms, money laundering operations, I think--not just in goods, but the </info>
    <info>illegal services going on inside the free-trade zones we have to be </info>
    <info>aware of as well. So money laundering through illegal offshore sports </info>
    <info>betting is a big area, and securities fraud--and the main point to bear </info>
    <info>in mind is that a free-trade zone was never supposed to be an </info>
    <info>``anything goes'' zone, and that is what has happened in some </info>
    <info>jurisdictions.</info>
    <info>    For example, a recent case in the Philippines of securities fraud </info>
    <info>by--I won't mention the nationality, but they weren't from the </info>
    <info>Philippines--had set up a boiler room inside a free-trade zone to </info>
    <info>commit securities fraud, defrauded many hundreds of millions--maybe I'm </info>
    <info>exaggerating--it was over a hundred million from investors in South </info>
    <info>Africa. And this was a group that came from a country that had already </info>
    <info>been investigated and arrested for securities fraud in their home </info>
    <info>country. So they find a place somewhere else in the world where they </info>
    <info>can set up shop with lax oversight and start conducting securities </info>
    <info>fraud. So you get an idea that it's not just goods, but also services, </info>
    <info>and that's why it's important, as our colleague from Europol mentioned, </info>
    <info>to have different work streams to address these.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Jacobzone. We don't have information specifically on the impact </info>
    <info>of free-trade zones on the U.S. economy. This is something that we want </info>
    <info>to do in the future, which is to look at the specific impacts of </info>
    <info>illicit trade on the U.S. economy, both through the impact on the U.S. </info>
    <info>retail market, but also the global impact on U.S. bonds.</info>
    <info>    What is clear is that we know that as soon as the country has more </info>
    <info>economic free-trade zones, then there is more likelihood to export </info>
    <info>fakes, and there are all sorts of correlations about this. So I'm bit </info>
    <info>sorry that--you know, I would be happy to make the data I speak more--</info>
    <info>--</info>
    <info>    We also have evidence that there should be some financial flows and </info>
    <info>illicit financial flows that are associated with free-trade zones. This </info>
    <info>is in the jurisdictions of another body which is not in OECD, but is </info>
    <info>hosted also in our organization called the FATF, the Financial Action </info>
    <info>Task Force. So I wish they could also shed light on this point.</info>
    <info>    I would also say that, from what we understand, the complexity of </info>
    <info>the topic from a policy perspective is the fact that what many people </info>
    <info>call free-trade zones--it's an aggregate that covers a number of </info>
    <info>things. And in fact, I guess there is an Association of Free Trade </info>
    <info>Zones in the United States. I think we met some of their people, and </info>
    <info>many of these zones that operate within the United States, I think, </info>
    <info>would be quite keen to undergo some controls or would be ready to not </info>
    <info>be labeled as misuse of free-trade zones. And there are a number of </info>
    <info>jurisdictions around the globe which I guess would have an incentive to </info>
    <info>not be seen as dark havens or as being singled out for conducting all </info>
    <info>this sort of, let's say, more dirty business.</info>
    <info>    So the task ahead in the future, I think, would also be to connect </info>
    <info>the real trade flows and some of the illicit financial flows, which is </info>
    <info>something where the information is a bit patchy, to look at the </info>
    <info>specific impact on countries and also ensure a process whereby some of </info>
    <info>the information can be gathered.</info>
    <info>    But the report on free-trade zones, which I am happy to send--and </info>
    <info>just had it in front of me on the screen--it takes quite a bit of </info>
    <info>econometrics and sophisticated data modeling to get to some of the </info>
    <info>policy results that we have in front of you today. And as was mentioned </info>
    <info>by Jack, there is also evidence that not only does this show in our </info>
    <info>statistics and econometrics, but this is corroborated by the experience </info>
    <info>of law enforcement officers whether at Europol, Interpol, our </info>
    <info>colleagues also at the World Customs Organization. So there is also </info>
    <info>qualitative evidence that is consistent with some of the empirical </info>
    <info>findings that we found.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Radisch. We could say, Paul--just a last word about that--on </info>
    <info>the basis of our reports, we know that U.S. brands are </info>
    <info>disproportionately affected. We know that, as I mentioned--to be more </info>
    <info>specific, the full range of HS code goods can be found transiting, so </info>
    <info>it's not just high-end, luxury brands--Louis Vuitton, Chanel; but those </info>
    <info>are definitely affected--but it's also pharmaceuticals, it's also </info>
    <info>automobile parts. So do you really want to be driving around in a car </info>
    <info>with counterfeit parts?</info>
    <info>    There's real public health concerns here when we're talking about </info>
    <info>counterfeit medicines, we're talking about counterfeit makeup that </info>
    <info>doesn't go through the same testing that the normal brands do and the </info>
    <info>legitimate goods do. Even parts that are going into our critical </info>
    <info>infrastructure--so everything across the spectrum can be counterfeited </info>
    <info>and is going to make its way through free-trade zones because--well, in </info>
    <info>certain respects, because of the lack of oversight.</info>
    <info>    So it's a very important gap that we need to get our minds around </info>
    <info>in this age of globalization that has ramped up in a way that really </info>
    <info>wasn't anticipated.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Jacobzone. To complement what Jack said and something that is </info>
    <info>quite topical for the U.S. economy today is this issue of public health </info>
    <info>and pharmaceuticals, I think, is a bit more acute in the United States </info>
    <info>than in other countries. And you have also seen the opioid crisis, and </info>
    <info>there are also a range of illicit trade factors that are also at play </info>
    <info>in this complex. And of course free-trade zones is one of the factors </info>
    <info>that fuel illicit trade; not the only one, but one of the factors.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Well, could I just actually follow up on that real </info>
    <info>quick with maybe just a short question, short answer, and that's, if </info>
    <info>the FTZs want it, and the impact is very big in the United States, and </info>
    <info>the United States is clearly strongly affected by this issue, are there </info>
    <info>barriers to completing a report? Do you intend to do a report? Or are </info>
    <info>there not resources, money, time?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Jacobzone. I don't feel we have any barriers in terms of no one </info>
    <info>is preventing us from conducting the work. I think we have some of the </info>
    <info>best data available. We are very grateful we are able to draw on all </info>
    <info>the U.S. custom seizures data, all the European custom seizures data. </info>
    <info>The World Customs Organizations has many people, friends who have </info>
    <info>helped us along the way, so I think we have all the data that is </info>
    <info>needed. I think in that context that's helpful.</info>
    <info>    Resources are a bit of an issue because this is not such a huge </info>
    <info>theme, and on the day-to-day basis this can be a bit of an issue. I </info>
    <info>guess in order to go further in this area, what we need is the adoption </info>
    <info>of these guidelines and the possibility to get some teeth in the </info>
    <info>process because once you have some teeth in the process, once you are </info>
    <info>able to get a process through which free-trade zones will have to be </info>
    <info>self-certified, would have to undergo some transparency measures </info>
    <info>through which countries would engage in some peer review mechanism, </info>
    <info>then you are going to sort of drive results and exert some pressure. </info>
    <info>And for that we will need some form of political buy-in and support--</info>
    <info>and I'd be happy to come back in the U.S. sometime next year once the </info>
    <info>guidance is adopted as a way to launch it and help set up some forces </info>
    <info>behind it--because if the guidance is just a piece of paper produced by </info>
    <info>the OECD, so what? But if on the basis of guidance there is clear </info>
    <info>action by nations and by countries, and let's have measures by customs </info>
    <info>to target certain products or certain free-trade zones, and concerted </info>
    <info>action, not just by the U.S. but also U.S. and Europe of the main </info>
    <info>importance in the globe, then they will feel the pressure.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. And just to clarify, that guidance would have to be </info>
    <info>adopted by consensus by the ambassadors of the OECD?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Jacobzone. The OECD is an international, intergovernmental </info>
    <info>organization, so the guidance, in our language our recommendation is </info>
    <info>adopted by the OECD Council, which means the ambassadors of the members </info>
    <info>of the 34, 35 members of the OECD.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Great. Thanks so much. So I'm going to ask one more </info>
    <info>question, and then we'll open it to the floor.</info>
    <info>    This one's for Dr. Fuller, and I hope I don't set you off too bad. </info>
    <info>I was just hoping you could speak maybe a little bit to how do FTZs </info>
    <info>play into authoritarian economics? How do authorization regimes view </info>
    <info>FTZs, or abuse them, or use them within the context of keeping the </info>
    <info>regime alive, pushing authoritarian influence in the world, et cetera, </info>
    <info>et cetera?</info>
    <info>    Dr. Fuller. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    I obviously take a more sort of academic approach to all this than </info>
    <info>an enforcement or a regulatory one. But there's this great research out </info>
    <info>there right now that looks at world development indicators and missing </info>
    <info>data as data. So it looks at when countries around the world from 1980 </info>
    <info>to 2011 did report data or didn't report aggregate data, like GDP, or </info>
    <info>literacy rates, and stuff like that. And it looks at it and it finds </info>
    <info>this difference between authoritarian and democratic countries. No </info>
    <info>matter how you want to divide it up, between democracies and </info>
    <info>autocracies, democracies are just more transparent in the sense that </info>
    <info>they just report more aggregate, credible economic data. And it's this </info>
    <info>clear trend across the board. And so knowing that research, reading </info>
    <info>it--this is based on formal theory, backed up by empirical evidence--it </info>
    <info>finds this sort of danger zone trap for authoritarian governments where </info>
    <info>when they report more, this can trigger coups and all sorts of other </info>
    <info>things that can be bad for business and supply chains that are </info>
    <info>increasingly becoming more complex all over the world, which is why I </info>
    <info>sort of look toward this promoting of looking inward at our own </info>
    <info>programs and democracies around the world.</info>
    <info>    I don't have much concern about U.S.-EU cooperation. I think </info>
    <info>they're doing great. I mean, I'm a big fan of law enforcement--don't </info>
    <info>get me wrong--but I became an academic because I don't like authority. </info>
    <info>So I get into this thinking of it in the fact that we don't need more </info>
    <info>and more enforcement necessarily. What we need is to grow these zone </info>
    <info>programs and to make them shining examples on the hill for the rest of </info>
    <info>the world. So if we get more aggregate economic data for these things, </info>
    <info>it can act as a coordination good in democracies where you have a free </info>
    <info>press, free media, academics who are going to study and report on this </info>
    <info>stuff. This allows private actors to better shop for what zone fits </info>
    <info>their needs better, to locate to them, to know which ones are--because </info>
    <info>everybody uses this risk-based analysis for everything, in trade, in </info>
    <info>finance and everything. And so if there's more data out there for </info>
    <info>private companies and the private sector to use in making their </info>
    <info>decisions, this allows them to make more efficient decisions on where </info>
    <info>to locate, what's available to them, where to go, which in turn grows </info>
    <info>the economy. It grows the zone. It makes the zone more successful. </info>
    <info>Which then, once you have that, then you can turn to the rest of the </info>
    <info>world, in places with these dangerous zones, or zones with more bad </info>
    <info>things going on into them, and then you can say, hey, look at what we </info>
    <info>did here, you should try it, too.</info>
    <info>    And then from a position of having these shining programs that are </info>
    <info>clear and transparent in the sense that they report aggregate, credible </info>
    <info>economic data, then you can talk to them from a better position of </info>
    <info>saying, well, look at what we did, and then they can do it, because </info>
    <info>it's going to be different in every single country. Every single </info>
    <info>country has different levels and different types of democracy and rule </info>
    <info>of law and different--other things that are going to need different--I </info>
    <info>mean, this is the beauty of the private sector and capitalism and </info>
    <info>democratic capitalism that built this country and made it so powerful </info>
    <info>and great. And so it needs to be sort of enhanced in that way.</info>
    <info>    And these aggregate indicators are a coordination good between the </info>
    <info>public and private sector that I feel is a great place to start, again </info>
    <info>because these zones are specifically geographically delineated, and </info>
    <info>therefore, theoretically, then can be monitored by both law enforcement </info>
    <info>and by both the private sector as well. And so I think that's a great </info>
    <info>place to start. While I think the recommendations are great and I think </info>
    <info>they should be adopted and that's a good start in changing norms around </info>
    <info>foreign trade zones around the world, I think the more pragmatic </info>
    <info>approach that's going to have the biggest effect, and that's in the </info>
    <info>national security interests of the United States and in every country </info>
    <info>that wants to do it, is to look at their own zone programs and look at </info>
    <info>ways to report better data on them.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Thanks so much, Dr. Fuller.</info>
    <info>    So first things first, let's get our own house in order, right?</info>
    <info>    Dr. Fuller. Yes.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Okay.</info>
    <info>    So just a real quick clarification question on the guidance. If the </info>
    <info>guidance passed, would something like FTZ guidance, where you can </info>
    <info>unanimously vote a country has suspicious activity, or something like </info>
    <info>that? And could you say a country's out of line with the guidance, </info>
    <info>therefore that's the teeth of FTZ, really, is the ability to issue </info>
    <info>these suspicious activities reports?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Radisch. At this point, the countries have to decide how they </info>
    <info>want to follow up on what to put in place, whether it's going to be </info>
    <info>through a process of peer reviewing, which is a standard OECD tool for </info>
    <info>compliance, or measuring up to what one has agreed to do. That's one </info>
    <info>option.</info>
    <info>    Another option is a certification regime, having firms that are </info>
    <info>professional in auditing going through these free-trade zones--there's </info>
    <info>so many of them--to see whether they are complying with a code of </info>
    <info>conduct along the terms that have been set up--and then having that </info>
    <info>transparently posted, for example, on the OECD website so everyone can </info>
    <info>see and countries can adjust their treatment of noncompliance the way </info>
    <info>they think is best fit, or whether there will be some commonality </info>
    <info>across the countries about what that might entail in terms of how they </info>
    <info>treat noncomplying jurisdictions.</info>
    <info>    So those are still some of the fine points that need to be decided </info>
    <info>at this stage of the development of this guidance. That's on course for </info>
    <info>a discussion over the next several months, but it's a fair point to ask </info>
    <info>about and it's one that the countries are debating.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Jacobzone. Jack, you were asking before why these countries set </info>
    <info>up free-trade zones. And I think the fact is that if you look at many </info>
    <info>countries that let's say do not have democratic regimes and at many </info>
    <info>semi-emerging economies--they have regulatory frameworks that are </info>
    <info>stifling business activity, you can't get a license, you can't get your </info>
    <info>business up. It's all very bad.</info>
    <info>    And so many of these countries, instead of reforming their whole </info>
    <info>economy in a positive way, are just taking a short cut by saying we're </info>
    <info>not going to change the whole thing, it's too hard, too difficult, we </info>
    <info>want to keep control. But we just created this small island, this </info>
    <info>thing, and there people can just do what they want so that it will </info>
    <info>create jobs and growth, and then we can have revenues for the State and </info>
    <info>we don't necessarily need to make change to the rest of the economy.</info>
    <info>    And generally the OECD advising--we're engaging with a number of </info>
    <info>these emerging economies--is to help them to adapt their whole </info>
    <info>regulatory framework, to adapt their economy as a whole so that it can </info>
    <info>benefit from globalization and be improved, and not necessarily try to </info>
    <info>take this sort of dual approach where you don't touch the big thing and </info>
    <info>you just allow everything in that small three things--because that's, I </info>
    <info>think, the approach that many countries have been doing as they see </info>
    <info>these ones as this is where you can quickly create a lot of jobs in </info>
    <info>some sort of an island of prosperity in economies that otherwise do not </info>
    <info>develop so well. I mean, I'm talking a bit generally here, but I think </info>
    <info>there is an aspect to this in the conversations.</info>
    <info>    And on the powers, the OECD's not FATF. So we have to be very </info>
    <info>clear. FATF is a very special organization that is distinct of the </info>
    <info>OECD. Even if there are close relationships between the two </info>
    <info>organizations, and at the sense of OECD work, there is mutual learning </info>
    <info>and peer pressure, what we call the process of peer review, whereby </info>
    <info>countries come together, discuss, and put things in the open. And as </info>
    <info>Jack mentioned, a lot of this we are serving as a secretariat to this </info>
    <info>organization and a lot of these decisions still have to be taken by the </info>
    <info>member nations.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Fuller. So I agree with that. I see that too. These are </info>
    <info>laboratories of experimentation in these authoritarian or, as we call </info>
    <info>them, developing economies. They use these zones as a way to experiment </info>
    <info>with liberal policies, and we have for a long time looked at them with </info>
    <info>the hope that somehow these authoritarian governments are going to </info>
    <info>magically liberalize their entire economy and their entire country.</info>
    <info>    And I think we're coming to a point right now--what I've been </info>
    <info>writing about a lot--is to where we're starting to recognize that's </info>
    <info>just not going to happen. They're getting the benefits out of these </info>
    <info>zones and out of these experiments with liberalization, and they're </info>
    <info>using it to survive longer in power, to get rid of term limits, to stay </info>
    <info>in office power, to strengthen their own regimes--and then in some </info>
    <info>cases, in the case of North Korea's free trades zones--threaten the </info>
    <info>United States back with the goods that they've been able to use to </info>
    <info>survive on.</info>
    <info>    So I would say this is where I get back to the better strategy, I </info>
    <info>think, in my opinion, while I totally respect and think what the OECD </info>
    <info>is doing is noble and a good cause, in my opinion I would think a </info>
    <info>better sort of foreign policy for the United States would be to sort of </info>
    <info>start disentangling with these zones and authoritarian regimes around </info>
    <info>the world and start focusing on the ones in more democratic countries </info>
    <info>that are better, again, at reporting aggregate, credible, economic data </info>
    <info>to their publics.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Thank you, Dr. Fuller.</info>
    <info>    And with that, we'll take some questions from the audience. Have we </info>
    <info>got any questions in this audience? Just raise your hand. Don't be shy.</info>
    <info>    Yes, please, David. Do we have any microphones? Oh, do you mind </info>
    <info>walking up to the mic, David?</info>
    <info>    If you'd like to ask a question next, you can go ahead and walk up.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Thank you very much, Paul, and thank you, the </info>
    <info>presenters, for their excellent briefings this afternoon.</info>
    <info>    And just building on some of the comments that we just heard on the </info>
    <info>importance of resources, I very much also agree with Dr. Fuller. I </info>
    <info>think it is important that we build up some of the more problematic </info>
    <info>free-trade zones by perhaps exploring pilots with them to provide the </info>
    <info>type of capacities, the capabilities. And I hope that after the </info>
    <info>guidelines are approved by the ministers--and that's a big if--but if </info>
    <info>they are approved, I think as we shift toward the implementation phase, </info>
    <info>that we begin to work within the OECD and other partners to develop the </info>
    <info>type of resources that I think are critical to work with our partners, </info>
    <info>including in Panama and others who I think are facing tremendous </info>
    <info>challenges--not only on the illicit trade across the various </info>
    <info>commodities that Jack mentioned, but on issues related to corruption as </info>
    <info>well--the issue of illicit financial flows is a critical part of the </info>
    <info>challenge in many free-trade zones today.</info>
    <info>    So the question to the OECD is, how are you working right now with </info>
    <info>free-trade zones in trying to enhance those type of capacities, those </info>
    <info>type of capabilities? And is there any plan to develop some pilots, as </info>
    <info>Dr. Fuller was mentioning, to support those who are committed toward </info>
    <info>more transparency through greater enforcement in free-trade zones?</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Please go ahead. Jack or Stephane?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Radisch. Sure. The short answer is that, David, we have invited </info>
    <info>some of the well-known free-trade zones of ill repute to our meetings. </info>
    <info>And we will continue to do so. We want to have them at the table. We </info>
    <info>want to work closely with them in precisely the basis that you </info>
    <info>described. That's the most constructive way. And it's only as a second </info>
    <info>order that countries would have as part of their discussion what to do </info>
    <info>if that fails and what kind of pressure can be exerted to make these </info>
    <info>jurisdictions, well, change their ways, change their behavior.</info>
    <info>    And there's a game plan for that as well in the OECD history, and </info>
    <info>that's the work on tax havens. So there are many ways of going about </info>
    <info>working with countries to effect the change that's needed, and the most </info>
    <info>constructive one would definitely be working with the countries that </info>
    <info>you mentioned yourself on a constructive basis. How can we improve upon </info>
    <info>the capacity to know better what's going on inside the zones and to </info>
    <info>weed out the criminal elements? Because everyone wants to benefit from </info>
    <info>trade, and the idea is that if some of these problematic jurisdictions </info>
    <info>can clean up their ways so that will make them--really they are </info>
    <info>championing a different way of doing business. And that will put </info>
    <info>pressure on the others who are not cleaning up their act, because </info>
    <info>eventually, if there is pressure brought to bear from OECD countries, </info>
    <info>then that will affect the businesses' decisions to actually use those </info>
    <info>free-trade zones or not.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Great. Okay, thanks.</info>
    <info>    Can we get another question from the public? Thanks so much.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Hi. Joe McKellen [ph] with Congressman Donovan's </info>
    <info>office.</info>
    <info>    With the unfortunate departure of the U.K. from the European Union, </info>
    <info>do you all kind of envision any difficulties in cracking down on </info>
    <info>illicit trade going to and from that country?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Jacobzone. I would say to the country because the U.K.'s still </info>
    <info>a member of the OECD. And in fact, if the U.K. is not any more a full </info>
    <info>member of the European Union, this will step up the incentives for our </info>
    <info>U.K. colleagues to achieve cooperation with other countries through the </info>
    <info>OECD. And we have some U.K. colleagues inside the room, and I think </info>
    <info>that there is a global anti-corruption effort at the OECD that is under </info>
    <info>the leadership of the U.K. or benefits a lot from the U.K.'s influence, </info>
    <info>and the U.K. is strongly engaged and committed on all these fronts and </info>
    <info>working closely inside the OECD.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Yes, please, Dr. Fuller, yes. I mean, we have the </info>
    <info>British Embassy here today, so we will also have them perhaps say </info>
    <info>something. And I also want to let Dr. Fuller speak, but I also want to </info>
    <info>ask Pedro to say something, because I know a big piece of the Brexit </info>
    <info>debate and the international law enforcement debate is exactly how the </info>
    <info>U.K. will work with Europol following Brexit. So it's an interesting </info>
    <info>question,</info>
    <info>    But, please.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Fuller. Okay, so the U.K. has actually been leading the fight </info>
    <info>really on this in other ways. I don't want to speak to Brexit or </info>
    <info>anything like that. I want to speak to U.K.'s leadership, especially in </info>
    <info>the area of things like beneficial ownership transparency, where they </info>
    <info>have been sort of leading the fight on this. While I sort of disagree </info>
    <info>with the public reporting of private data, I do find groups that are </info>
    <info>analyzing the data here have come up with very useful insights that are </info>
    <info>good examples of this transparency and credible aggregate data that I'm </info>
    <info>talking about. For example, they've analyzed it and looked through and </info>
    <info>found that there's approximately 1.2 owners per business--that's </info>
    <info>incorporated--and that there's a certain percentage that aren't able to </info>
    <info>identify their number. These are good examples of aggregate data that </info>
    <info>allow private and public actors to coordinate their actions together, </info>
    <info>and which spurs economic growth, because, again, this is what it's </info>
    <info>about, in my view. There's the question of right, so, what am I talking </info>
    <info>about that's going to fight illicit trade? And the answer is not much. </info>
    <info>I'm talking about drowning out illicit trade by growing licit trade. So </info>
    <info>it's a perceptions thing. If you grow the amount of the legal economy </info>
    <info>happening, then the impacts and the effects of the illicit economy </info>
    <info>shrink relative to the size of the legal economy. And so that's what </info>
    <info>I'm trying to make an argument for growing the legal economy and taking </info>
    <info>steps toward that in order to shrink the impact of the illicit economy. </info>
    <info>Because you're never going to get rid of bad actors. They're always </info>
    <info>going to be there.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Even if they--[inaudible].</info>
    <info>    Dr. Fuller. Exactly.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Could we hear real quick from Pedro? And then, John, </info>
    <info>if I could force you to the mic, if you don't mind?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Kay. Yes, sure.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Yes. [Laughs.] Okay, good.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Rodrigues. Okay, so Brexit-related questions are very frequent </info>
    <info>nowadays. And, well, short answer: It remains to be seen. The U.K. is </info>
    <info>one of the largest, if not the largest contributor of information to </info>
    <info>Europol. It's a leading force in many different crime areas, many </info>
    <info>different platforms. And I don't think that will change too much.</info>
    <info>    That said, there's a couple of rules which are deeply enshrined in </info>
    <info>Europol's regulation, and one of those which is very important is that </info>
    <info>for Europol to be able to provide the full extent of support that we </info>
    <info>provide to our partners, the investigation in question needs to have </info>
    <info>the involvement of at least two EU member states. So if in the past we </info>
    <info>could support full investigation between the U.K. and France, for </info>
    <info>example, now we would need the U.K., France, possibly, if negotiations </info>
    <info>don't--I'm pretty sure that the U.K. will negotiate its own terms with </info>
    <info>Europol. It's in everyone's best interest that the U.K. remains close </info>
    <info>to Europol, and I'm pretty sure that an operational agreement will be </info>
    <info>signed and in place. But one of the possibilities or one of the </info>
    <info>discussions is that, for example, the U.K. would actually need two </info>
    <info>additional member states in this case to be able to bring an </info>
    <info>investigation to Europol so it could be supported as a high priority </info>
    <info>case, which means that we can devote a full range of services and </info>
    <info>support.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. John.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Kay. Okay, thank you for the--[inaudible]. [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    My name's John Kay. I work out of the British Embassy here in </info>
    <info>Washington, but I'm a career U.K. customs officer. My current employer </info>
    <info>is HM Revenue--Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs. So I'm here as actually </info>
    <info>one of the U.K. law enforcement liaison officers based in Washington </info>
    <info>working with our partner agencies in the U.S. and other nearby </info>
    <info>countries.</info>
    <info>    To echo my friend from Europol, Pedro, we do have an international </info>
    <info>network of liaison officers not just in the globe but in particular in </info>
    <info>Europol, and that will continue. The U.K. is seeking to remain a member </info>
    <info>of Europol and will continue to have a number of agents from police, </info>
    <info>National Crime Agency, and HM Revenue &amp; Customs based in Europol.</info>
    <info>    And again, answering the question in particular, this is not a </info>
    <info>political question, and it's certainly not something I'm answering on </info>
    <info>behalf of the ambassador here for the U.K. in the U.S. But speaking as </info>
    <info>an HM Revenue &amp; Customs officer, we do value international </info>
    <info>collaboration. We work bilaterally with all our colleagues in a number </info>
    <info>of law enforcement agencies--not just in the U.S., but globally. And </info>
    <info>the fact that we may be moving toward an EU exit next March, in the </info>
    <info>forthcoming year, doesn't mean that we won't continue to collaborate </info>
    <info>with law enforcement.</info>
    <info>    And especially when it comes to illicit trade, counterfeit trade, </info>
    <info>the U.K. is absolutely committed to a level playing field for economic </info>
    <info>prosperity for everyone. And one thing I would emphasize is just </info>
    <info>because the U.K. may be leaving the European Union doesn't mean that we </info>
    <info>don't want to take our ball home with us and go to bed. We literally do </info>
    <info>want to continue to be a full member of the international economic </info>
    <info>community for economic prosperity, both across the globe, in Europe, </info>
    <info>but obviously important for the U.K. as well. And that means leveling </info>
    <info>that playing field, encouraging private sort of enterprise to move </info>
    <info>economic goods across international boundaries. And where free-trade </info>
    <info>zones are used to help prosper internationally, they should be </info>
    <info>obviously subject to some sort of support by domestic revenue and </info>
    <info>customs authorities to enable that to happen in the correct way.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Thank you very much, John.</info>
    <info>    KAY: And finally, the only thing I would say is thank you to the </info>
    <info>OECD for their work on this, and the U.K. continues to support your </info>
    <info>activity in this regard.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Excellent. Thanks very much.</info>
    <info>    Do we have more questions from the audience? Step right up. Get </info>
    <info>your exercise.</info>
    <info>    Okay. Well, I'm going to ask one more question. If there's any </info>
    <info>last-minute questions after that, we can take them. Okay?</info>
    <info>    So my final question for OECD is, have you highlighted any of the </info>
    <info>worst offenders, the worst FTZs? Can you speak to anything like that? </info>
    <info>[Laughs.]</info>
    <info>    Mr. Jacobzone. I would say we're economists. We're not law </info>
    <info>enforcement officials, so we're not treating individual cases. We are </info>
    <info>treating aggregated sets of data. So I think this sort of question </info>
    <info>should be more directed to our colleagues in law enforcement, our </info>
    <info>colleague from the U.K. or from Europol, than to the OECD as an </info>
    <info>organization, I'm afraid.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Radisch. At this point in time.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Massaro. Got it. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Okay. If there aren't any more questions, anybody want to say </info>
    <info>anything else on the panel? Then we will close the briefing.</info>
    <info>    Thank you so much. [Applause.]</info>
