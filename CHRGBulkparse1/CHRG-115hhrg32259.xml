    <info>ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE  </info>
    <info>    The Helsinki process, formally titled the Conference on Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe, traces its origin to the signing of the </info>
    <info>Helsinki Final Act in Finland on August 1, 1975, by the leaders of 33 </info>
    <info>European countries, the United States and Canada. As of January 1, </info>
    <info>1995, the Helsinki process was renamed the Organization for Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The membership of the OSCE has </info>
    <info>expanded to 56 participating States, reflecting the breakup of the </info>
    <info>Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.</info>
    <info>    The OSCE Secretariat is in Vienna, Austria, where weekly meetings </info>
    <info>of the participating States' permanent representatives are held. In </info>
    <info>addition, specialized seminars and meetings are convened in various </info>
    <info>locations. Periodic consultations are held among Senior Officials, </info>
    <info>Ministers and Heads of State or Government.</info>
    <info>    Although the OSCE continues to engage in standard setting in the </info>
    <info>fields of military security, economic and environmental cooperation, </info>
    <info>and human rights and humanitarian concerns, the Organization is </info>
    <info>primarily focused on initiatives designed to prevent, manage and </info>
    <info>resolve conflict within and among the participating States. The </info>
    <info>Organization deploys numerous missions and field activities located in </info>
    <info>Southeastern and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The </info>
    <info>website of the OSCE is: &lt;www.osce.org&gt;.</info>
    <info>ABOUT THE COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE</info>
    <info>    The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as </info>
    <info>the Helsinki Commission, is a U.S. Government agency created in 1976 to </info>
    <info>monitor and encourage compliance by the participating States with their </info>
    <info>OSCE commitments, with a particular emphasis on human rights.</info>
    <info>    The Commission consists of nine members from the United States </info>
    <info>Senate, nine members from the House of Representatives, and one member </info>
    <info>each from the Departments of State, Defense and Commerce. The positions </info>
    <info>of Chair and Co-Chair rotate between the Senate and House every two </info>
    <info>years, when a new Congress convenes. A professional staff assists the </info>
    <info>Commissioners in their work.</info>
    <info>    In fulfilling its mandate, the Commission gathers and disseminates </info>
    <info>relevant information to the U.S. Congress and the public by convening </info>
    <info>hearings, issuing reports that reflect the views of Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission and/or its staff, and providing details about the activities </info>
    <info>of the Helsinki process and developments in OSCE participating States.</info>
    <info>    The Commission also contributes to the formulation and execution of </info>
    <info>U.S. policy regarding the OSCE, including through Member and staff </info>
    <info>participation on U.S. Delegations to OSCE meetings. Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission have regular contact with parliamentarians, government </info>
    <info>officials, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and </info>
    <info>private individuals from participating States. The website of the </info>
    <info>Commission is: &lt;www.csce.gov&gt;.</info>

    <info>    Ms. Parker. Good afternoon. My name is Allison Hollabaugh Parker. I </info>
    <info>am general counsel at the Helsinki Commission, also known as the </info>
    <info>Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and it's my pleasure </info>
    <info>to welcome you this afternoon to our briefing on creating ``A Truly </info>
    <info>Inclusive Society: Encouraging the Ability in Disability.''</info>
    <info>    As you may know, 57 million Americans are living with disabilities, </info>
    <info>400,000 of them with Down syndrome. Almost three decades ago, President </info>
    <info>Bush signed into law the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). This </info>
    <info>provided individuals with disabilities access to the same employment </info>
    <info>opportunities and benefits available to people without disabilities, </info>
    <info>encouraged employers to make reasonable accommodations, required state </info>
    <info>and local governments to make all services and programs available to </info>
    <info>individuals with disabilities, prohibited places of public </info>
    <info>accommodation from discriminating against individuals with </info>
    <info>disabilities, and directed businesses to make reasonable modifications </info>
    <info>when serving individuals with disabilities.</info>
    <info>    In so doing, the ADA has broken down many barriers blocking the </info>
    <info>full participation of individuals with disabilities in their </info>
    <info>communities, in the economy, and across the United States, in every </info>
    <info>sphere in which they would like to participate. While the United States </info>
    <info>has an exemplary system of integration, empowerment, and protection, </info>
    <info>individuals with intellectual disabilities, like Down syndrome, have </info>
    <info>recommended numerous further improvements to U.S. law in order to fully </info>
    <info>realize the goals of the Americans With Disabilities Act.</info>
    <info>    This briefing will explore best practices developed federally and </info>
    <info>locally in the United States to empower and integrate individuals with </info>
    <info>intellectual disabilities. We'll also discuss changes that will enable </info>
    <info>individuals with disabilities to reach their full potential. The law on </info>
    <info>this subject is a work in process and I look forward to hearing from </info>
    <info>our five panelists this afternoon, the first of whom is Sarah Hart </info>
    <info>Weir. She is the president and CEO of the National Down Syndrome </info>
    <info>Society (NDSS), which is the largest nonprofit in the United States </info>
    <info>dedicated to advocating for people with Down syndrome and their </info>
    <info>families. As president, she oversees the organization's mission, </info>
    <info>vision, and administration. Ms. Weir works each day to ensure people </info>
    <info>with Down syndrome are represented at every table where critical </info>
    <info>decisions are made, whether it's the White House, the U.S. Congress, </info>
    <info>the United Nations, or in state capitols across the country. Ms. Weir </info>
    <info>has a Bachelor of Arts in psychology and political leadership from </info>
    <info>Westminster College and a Master of Science in public policy and </info>
    <info>management from Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Weir.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Weir. Good afternoon. My name is Sarah Hart Weir and I'm the </info>
    <info>president and CEO of the world's largest Down syndrome advocacy </info>
    <info>organization, the National Down Syndrome Society.</info>
    <info>    I have had the opportunity to work with people with Down syndrome </info>
    <info>for almost 20 years and was inspired to get involved in this amazing </info>
    <info>community from my best friend, Kasey, who happens to have Down syndrome </info>
    <info>and lives in Kansas.</info>
    <info>    On behalf of NDSS, the leading human rights organization for all </info>
    <info>individuals with Down syndrome, it's an honor to sit at this table </info>
    <info>today to present to the Helsinki Commission with Dr. Lazarus, one of </info>
    <info>our favorite NDSS #DSWORKS&#4; employment partners, Mark and John Cronin </info>
    <info>from John's Crazy Socks, and, of course, my esteemed colleague Kayla </info>
    <info>McKeon.</info>
    <info>    At NDSS, we believe if you're not at the table you're on the menu. </info>
    <info>I personally want to thank the Helsinki Commission for today's </info>
    <info>imperative discussion and lending a critical voice to a population </info>
    <info>that, even in our great nation, the United States of America, and still </info>
    <info>in 2018 is far more discriminated against than any other community.</info>
    <info>    Today's topic, ``A Truly Inclusive Society: Encouraging the Ability </info>
    <info>and Disability,'' is something we live and breathe at the National Down </info>
    <info>Syndrome Society as we strive to achieve equality for all Americans </info>
    <info>with Down syndrome in the United States.</info>
    <info>    Our great nation's first motto, ``E Pluribus Unum,'' is embedded in </info>
    <info>every fabric of our country's rich history. The phrase is used on the </info>
    <info>currency, the seal of the president, vice president, the U.S. Congress, </info>
    <info>the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and on the seal of our Supreme Court. </info>
    <info>It is cemented in our country's rich history, culture, and values. </info>
    <info>Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness comes from the Latin phrase </info>
    <info>``out of many, one.'' From this belief springs a unifying purpose for </info>
    <info>our Nation: equality. Unfortunately, in the United States and around </info>
    <info>the world, people with Down syndrome and other disabilities are not </info>
    <info>treated as one.</info>
    <info>    At NDSS, we believe no matter your differences or your abilities </info>
    <info>you should have a fair shot at the American dream. And we work hard </info>
    <info>each and every day to ensure America's motto is upheld for people with </info>
    <info>Down syndrome and that ``one'' truly means one.</info>
    <info>    At NDSS, a fourth of our staff have Down syndrome and work across </info>
    <info>all of our programs and departments. Not a single decision within our </info>
    <info>organization is made without their input and the input of our self-</info>
    <info>advocates.</info>
    <info>    At NDSS, our programs--including our National Advocacy and Policy </info>
    <info>Center here in Washington, DC, our #DSWORKS&#4; employment program, and </info>
    <info>our health promotion and resources program--each of these programs are </info>
    <info>dedicated to advancing proactive policies and providing invaluable </info>
    <info>resources on issues across the lifespan, from birth to old age, and </info>
    <info>across five key critical pillars: health care and research, education, </info>
    <info>employment, community integration, and economic self-sufficiency.</info>
    <info>    Next year, we will celebrate NDSS's 40th anniversary. During this </info>
    <info>time, one of the most important advancements for individuals with Down </info>
    <info>syndrome has been an increased access to advancements in health care. </info>
    <info>This result has led to a dramatic increase in the life expectancy for </info>
    <info>people with Down syndrome. In 1983, it was 25. Today it's well into the </info>
    <info>60s. And this is a result of early detection of co-occurring </info>
    <info>conditions, like congenital heart defects, quality dental care and, of </info>
    <info>course, inclusion.</info>
    <info>    From its origins in 1979, NDSS has been involved in so many Federal </info>
    <info>and state advocacy efforts as well as judicial efforts that have helped </info>
    <info>individuals with disabilities become more included in society: The </info>
    <info>passage of IDEA that guarantees students with disabilities the right to </info>
    <info>be educated alongside their peers in their neighborhood school; the </info>
    <info>Americans With Disabilities Act, or ADA, that prohibits discrimination </info>
    <info>against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life and </info>
    <info>the subsequent Olmstead Supreme Court decision that requires public </info>
    <info>agencies to provide services in the most integrated settings; of course </info>
    <info>the shutdown of Willowbrook in New York, which was brought to the </info>
    <info>forefront of the public's conscientiousness to shut down institutions </info>
    <info>across the country; and something we at NDSS are extremely proud of, </info>
    <info>the landmark passage of the Stephen Beck Jr. Achieving a Better Life </info>
    <info>Experience Act, best known as the ABLE Act, which allows individuals </info>
    <info>with disabilities to save their own money for the future.</info>
    <info>    These accomplishments and milestones were vital to ensure </info>
    <info>individuals with disabilities have access and adequate supports to the </info>
    <info>basic liberties those without disabilities enjoy: education, community </info>
    <info>integration, housing, employment, and savings.</info>
    <info>    Despite these significant advancements, we have a long way to go. </info>
    <info>People with Down syndrome are still held back and confined to laws that </info>
    <info>were put into place when we were still institutionalizing people with </info>
    <info>disabilities, the life expectancy was very, very low and a time when </info>
    <info>perceptions of people with Down syndrome were not even realized.</info>
    <info>    Still, today, individuals with disabilities still do not have </info>
    <info>access to marriage equality. Individuals with disabilities cannot </info>
    <info>maintain their vital benefits while working, despite--and you'll hear </info>
    <info>from Kayla and John--being ready, willing, and able to work. Though we </info>
    <info>fought for IDEA, many students do not have the access to inclusive </info>
    <info>education to which they are entitled to and is the basis of life in our </info>
    <info>schools each and every day.</info>
    <info>    Many cannot choose where they want to live and housing options are </info>
    <info>extremely low. And many are still not economically self-sufficient, </info>
    <info>despite ABLE accounts being open to qualifying individuals across the </info>
    <info>Nation.</info>
    <info>    Outrageously, many are still getting paid way below the minimum </info>
    <info>wage. We still have Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, a </info>
    <info>law that was put in place in 1938, where businesses can apply for wage </info>
    <info>certificates from the Department of Labor to pay individuals with </info>
    <info>disabilities way below the Federal minimum wage, sometimes as low as 30 </info>
    <info>cents an hour. Something we at NDSS are advocating very aggressively </info>
    <info>for is the passage of the TIME Act led by Congressman Greg Harper. Last </info>
    <info>year, NDSS launched our campaign to end #LawSyndrome, to draw attention </info>
    <info>to these issues and to advocate for change.</info>
    <info>    Down syndrome does not hold Kayla, John or any of our friends and </info>
    <info>loved ones with Down syndrome back. It's truly these antiquated laws </info>
    <info>that are preventing individuals with Down syndrome from reaching their </info>
    <info>full potential. And we at NDSS will not stop until every single </info>
    <info>American with Down syndrome has the same rights as every other </info>
    <info>American.</info>
    <info>    One of my proudest accomplishments at NDSS is ensuring individuals </info>
    <info>with Down syndrome are not even--not just part of our incredible team </info>
    <info>and wonderful organization, but they are at every table where key </info>
    <info>decisions about their future are made. When you have a seat at the </info>
    <info>table, you have a say in those decisions and how they are made. When </info>
    <info>it's your table, you make the decisions. This is how we end </info>
    <info>#LawSyndrome.</info>
    <info>    I'm honored to introduce--and I know Allison will as well and let </info>
    <info>Kayla follow--my colleague, who has not only earned a seat at the </info>
    <info>table, she owns the table and she owns Capitol Hill.</info>
    <info>    Thank you, Allison, and the members of the Helsinki Commission and </info>
    <info>staff for making today possible.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. And thank you, Ms. Weir, for the long and hard work of </info>
    <info>NDSS to ensure that we continue to move forward in the United States in </info>
    <info>the advancement of human and civil rights for individuals with </info>
    <info>intellectual disabilities.</info>
    <info>    I'd like to next introduce Kayla McKeon.</info>
    <info>    Am I saying that correctly?</info>
    <info>    Ms. McKeon. Yes.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. She is the first registered lobbyist in the United </info>
    <info>States with Down syndrome and she's a member of the Down Syndrome </info>
    <info>Society's Self-Advocate Advisory Board where she serves as manager of </info>
    <info>grassroots advocacy. Prior to joining the NDSS team, she worked for </info>
    <info>Congressman John Katko from New York. Ms. McKeon is also a Special </info>
    <info>Olympics athlete and a Special Olympics congress member. In 2011, she </info>
    <info>competed in the Special Olympic World Games in Athens, Greece, winning </info>
    <info>a silver and a bronze medal.</info>
    <info>    Kayla.</info>
    <info>    Ms. McKeon. And thank you, Allison.</info>
    <info>    And good afternoon. And to echo Sarah's words, thank you to Allison </info>
    <info>and the Helsinki Commission for letting me speak today.</info>
    <info>    My name is Kayla McKeon and I am the manager of grassroots advocacy </info>
    <info>at the National Down Syndrome Society and I am the first registered </info>
    <info>lobbyist who just happens to have Down syndrome.</info>
    <info>    Down syndrome doesn't define me and it definitely does not stop me. </info>
    <info>What limits me and my fellow advocates and friends with Down syndrome--</info>
    <info>as Sarah mentioned, #LawSyndrome is a series of very old and antiquated </info>
    <info>laws that were passed when I would not have lived past my adolescence </info>
    <info>or even my childhood, and even if I did, I would not have left the </info>
    <info>hospital with my parents because people with Down syndrome were still </info>
    <info>being institutionalized. These laws were put in place when the social </info>
    <info>acceptance of individuals with disabilities was at an all-time low.</info>
    <info>    I was lucky in my upbringing in Syracuse, New York. When I was 18 </info>
    <info>months old, my parents involved me in an early education program. I </info>
    <info>progressed through school alongside my classmates and graduated at 18 </info>
    <info>as soon as inclusive education became possible. I was always in an </info>
    <info>inclusive setting. I won't deny there were bumps and stumbling blocks </info>
    <info>along the way, but my parents always thought it was best for me to be </info>
    <info>included with my classmates and placed in settings that challenged me </info>
    <info>to reach my highest potential. And there were times when they pushed </info>
    <info>me, but it was only because they knew I could succeed.</info>
    <info>    I earned awards in 8th and 9th grades--character, commitment and </info>
    <info>courage--as well as in English and math. My final grade for algebra was </info>
    <info>in the 90s. I got a 93 in a math regent's exam. So if you are familiar, </info>
    <info>you know how tough that was. [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    Later, an agency known as Vocational and Educational Services for </info>
    <info>Individuals with Disabilities, or VESID, and my high school had set up </info>
    <info>a program to take an office technology program. It was a 6-month </info>
    <info>certificate program for adults. They arranged it where I could do it--</info>
    <info>go through it twice. I passed the program, earned a certificate and, as </info>
    <info>a result, I am very fast on the keyboard. I was even the commencement </info>
    <info>speaker.</info>
    <info>    I also attended Onondaga Community College taking some noncredit </info>
    <info>courses. But I thought to myself, does it make sense I'm doing all the </info>
    <info>work without earning any credits? But I like the classes, so I began </info>
    <info>taking one class per semester for credit. I can happily say I am now </info>
    <info>more than halfway to earning my Associate's degree. I started back in </info>
    <info>August. I love taking classes with my peers. Many of my classmates are </info>
    <info>a little bit younger than me, but so what?</info>
    <info>    I started advocating a number of years ago. I started advocating on </info>
    <info>laws about the differently abled by going to elementary schools, going </info>
    <info>to middle schools, colleges, and the schools of nursing. I try to </info>
    <info>motivate them to do the best that they can do. My message to kids is to </info>
    <info>persevere. I am who I am today partly because I was included with my </info>
    <info>peers throughout my childhood.</info>
    <info>    One day in Syracuse, I met John Katko at a baseball game. He was </info>
    <info>running for the U.S. House of Representatives. He handed me his </info>
    <info>business card, so I handed him mine. He called me later and said if he </info>
    <info>was elected he wanted me to come and intern for him. When he won, I </info>
    <info>became an intern in the Syracuse office. I represented him at different </info>
    <info>events and did office work. In June of last year, he asked me to go </info>
    <info>with him to a disability conference in Washington. We didn't realize at </info>
    <info>that time it was with the National Down Syndrome Society. It was there </info>
    <info>at the end of the meeting that Sarah Hart Weir, our president and CEO </info>
    <info>of NDSS, offered me the job of manager of grassroots advocacy. I </info>
    <info>started last October.</info>
    <info>    With my position as the first registered lobbyist with Down </info>
    <info>syndrome, I go to Capitol Hill and speak to many members of Congress </info>
    <info>and their staff on issues that are very important to me. I helped lobby </info>
    <info>to pass the original ABLE Act as a volunteer for NDSS and now the ABLE </info>
    <info>to Work Act and the ABLE Financial Planning Act as a lobbyist. These </info>
    <info>laws allow me and my friends, the differently abled, to have savings </info>
    <info>accounts and meaningful employment without giving up our benefits.</info>
    <info>    We are now tirelessly working on ending #LawSyndrome. Down syndrome </info>
    <info>doesn't stop us, it never stops us. And there are some old, antiquated </info>
    <info>laws that hold us back. One example is the 80-year-old provision with </info>
    <info>the Fair Labor Standards Act, known as Section 14(c) that Sarah had </info>
    <info>mentioned. People like me are still getting paid cents an hour while </info>
    <info>other individuals performing the same task that are paid at least </info>
    <info>minimum wage. These issues segregate us from the rest of society. We </info>
    <info>are still viewed as ``less than.''</info>
    <info>    Society is ready to move past these laws. When will the government </info>
    <info>keep up? [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    We still have a long way to go for individuals with Down syndrome </info>
    <info>to be fully included in society. To me, having Down syndrome is who I </info>
    <info>am, but it has never stopped me from achieving my own hopes, dreams and </info>
    <info>passions. What I want for my life and all individuals with disabilities </info>
    <info>is for us to be treated just like everyone else, an opportunity to live </info>
    <info>the American dream.</info>
    <info>    Thank you. [Applause.]</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Thank you, Kayla. I have no doubt that you will achieve </info>
    <info>all that you set your heart and your mind to do.</info>
    <info>    Ms. McKeon. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Next we have Dr. Sheryl Lazarus. She is the director of </info>
    <info>the TIES Center at which she conducts research and provides technical </info>
    <info>assistance on educational change that will support the integration of </info>
    <info>all students into inclusive learning settings. She addresses barriers </info>
    <info>to inclusion and works to build consensus and capacity among </info>
    <info>practitioners and policymakers for sustainable inclusion. Dr. Lazarus </info>
    <info>has published more than 200 articles and reports, including on the </info>
    <info>instruction and assessment of students with disabilities and English </info>
    <info>learners with disabilities.</info>
    <info>    Please welcome Dr. Sheryl Lazarus.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Lazarus. Thank you. I would like to thank the Helsinki </info>
    <info>Commission for the opportunity to talk with you today. I'm the director </info>
    <info>of TIES Center. TIES is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and </info>
    <info>is the national technical assistance center on inclusive practices and </info>
    <info>policies. Its purpose is to create sustainable changes to educational </info>
    <info>systems so that students with the most significant cognitive </info>
    <info>disabilities can fully engage in the same instructional and </info>
    <info>noninstructional activities as their general education peers, while </info>
    <info>being instructed in ways that meet their individual needs.</info>
    <info>    Expectations for students with disabilities in the United States </info>
    <info>historically have been low, but several laws have encouraged a more </info>
    <info>inclusive educational system. Beginning in 1975, Public Law 94-142 set </info>
    <info>a precedent for inclusive education with its least-restrictive </info>
    <info>environment clause. The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act of </info>
    <info>1997, which is often referred to as IDEA, says that students with </info>
    <info>disabilities have the right to learn the general curriculum based on </info>
    <info>the same standards as their peers who do not have disabilities.</info>
    <info>    The most recent reauthorization of IDEA, as well as the 2015 </info>
    <info>reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also </info>
    <info>known as the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, states that education </info>
    <info>must be designed to promote progress in the general education </info>
    <info>curriculum.</info>
    <info>    IDEA also mandates that students with disabilities be provided with </info>
    <info>a free and appropriate public education which includes both special </info>
    <info>education and related services, and that students are to be educated in </info>
    <info>the least-restrictive environment. This creates a legal presumption </info>
    <info>that the general education setting is the default unless the child </info>
    <info>cannot be educated satisfactorily there, even after the necessary </info>
    <info>support is provided.</info>
    <info>    These laws and others provide the underpinnings of inclusive </info>
    <info>education in the United States, but the real heroes are the individuals </info>
    <info>with disabilities, their families, and advocates. They have exercised </info>
    <info>their rights, and sometimes had to push, shove, and hold the </info>
    <info>educational system to what the law required, though they must consider </info>
    <info>themselves fortunate to be in a country in which individuals with </info>
    <info>disabilities and their families have the legal right to disagree with </info>
    <info>schools and the government.</info>
    <info>    Next, I'll discuss two critical components that support sustainable </info>
    <info>inclusion for all students. The first is raising expectations. It's </info>
    <info>important to note that students with the most significant cognitive </info>
    <info>disabilities are very diverse. For example, more students with </info>
    <info>significant cognitive disabilities can read than you might think. Two-</info>
    <info>thirds are readers. Unfortunately, in the past, students with the most </info>
    <info>significant cognitive disabilities often were only taught functional </info>
    <info>skills such as how to care for themselves.</info>
    <info>    The curriculum started to change in the early 2000s when </info>
    <info>accountability for academic performance for students with disabilities </info>
    <info>was strengthened. As teachers introduced content similar to what peers </info>
    <info>were learning, students with the most significant cognitive </info>
    <info>disabilities surprised us with what they could do. We heard over and </info>
    <info>over, who knew that these students could learn to read and do math and </info>
    <info>social studies and science?</info>
    <info>    A second critical component that supports inclusion is what we call </info>
    <info>communicative competence. Most students with the most significant </info>
    <info>cognitive disabilities communicate verbally just like everyone else. </info>
    <info>However, a few students communicate in other ways or show minimal </info>
    <info>response to stimuli. Students who lack a consistent mode of </info>
    <info>communication are often served in segregated educational settings </info>
    <info>because many teachers feel unprepared to support them. A key to </info>
    <info>successful inclusion and better outcomes is getting a communications </info>
    <info>system in place, ideally by kindergarten or the early primary grades.</info>
    <info>    Here is an example which illustrates how a commitment to building </info>
    <info>communicative competence helps enable students to thrive in inclusive </info>
    <info>contexts. Jaimar Fish is a middle school student in Danville, Kentucky. </info>
    <info>He has multiple disabilities. He did not have a consistent </info>
    <info>communication system. He gets along well with other students, but it </info>
    <info>was difficult for him to develop relationships with them because he </info>
    <info>could not communicate. His educational team addressed his </info>
    <info>communications needs by first figuring out what he enjoyed and might </info>
    <info>want to communicate about. Then they gave him what we refer to as an </info>
    <info>augmentative and alternative communication device. In his case, this is </info>
    <info>a simple motion-detection switch. It is activated by his smallest </info>
    <info>movements and translates these movements into verbal language. Now </info>
    <info>Jaimar can respond to questions during math, reading, and other </info>
    <info>classes, talk with his friends about his likes and dislikes, and is one </info>
    <info>of the group.</info>
    <info>    In addition to raising expectations and communicative competence, </info>
    <info>there are many other components of successful inclusion, such as high-</info>
    <info>quality, accessible instructional resources and providing training and </info>
    <info>professional development to all teachers so that they can confidently </info>
    <info>instruct students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in </info>
    <info>inclusive settings. Please see my written statement for additional </info>
    <info>details.</info>
    <info>    Research has shown us the path to successfully educating all </info>
    <info>students, including those with the most significant cognitive </info>
    <info>disabilities. And the United States has taken some steps in that </info>
    <info>direction, but we need to have the commitment to make sustainable </info>
    <info>inclusion happen for all students. To improve outcomes for kids, the </info>
    <info>behavior of adults needs to change. There needs to be shared </info>
    <info>responsibility across educators for all students with all students </info>
    <info>being held to high expectations. Together, we can create a future that </info>
    <info>supports the learning of all students in inclusive settings, which will </info>
    <info>lead to a future with communities where all individuals are valued </info>
    <info>members.</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Thank you, Dr. Lazarus. Thank you for the very </info>
    <info>practical suggestions that you've both developed and shared with us </info>
    <info>today.</info>
    <info>    Next, we have John Lee Cronin. John is a 22-year-old man full of </info>
    <info>life and aspirations, who also happens to have Down syndrome. His love </info>
    <info>of colorful and fun socks and desire to perform meaningful work </info>
    <info>inspired him to found a new business, John's Crazy Socks. John is the </info>
    <info>chief happiness officer of John's Crazy Socks. John is a graduate of </info>
    <info>Huntington High School and a Special Olympics athlete.</info>
    <info>    John.</info>
    <info>    Mr. J. Cronin. Good afternoon. My name is John Cronin and I am the </info>
    <info>co-founder and chief happiness officer of John's Crazy Socks. I come </info>
    <info>here to stand up for people with Down syndrome and all people with </info>
    <info>different abilities.</info>
    <info>    I have Down syndrome and Down syndrome never held me back. I am 22 </info>
    <info>years old and I work hard every day to show the world that people with </info>
    <info>Down syndrome are ready, willing, and able to work. Give us a chance </info>
    <info>and we can be successful.</info>
    <info>    You may have heard about John's Crazy Socks. We have a mission to </info>
    <info>spread happiness. We have a good story, but we are a good business, </info>
    <info>too. We offer 2,300 different socks. We have shipped our socks to every </info>
    <info>state and 80 different countries. This year, we will ship over 170,000 </info>
    <info>orders and earn over $6 million. I may be cute, but I run a serious </info>
    <info>business.</info>
    <info>    I started this business with my dad, Mark. It was my idea and I </info>
    <info>came up with the name. My dad--my dad--believed in me and he gave me a </info>
    <info>chance. I love my dad. I work hard every day. I love my business. And </info>
    <info>let me tell you why I started John's Crazy Socks.</info>
    <info>    In the fall of 2016, I began my last year of school and needed to </info>
    <info>decide what I would do. When school ended, I had received a good </info>
    <info>education at Huntington High School. I was healthy and ready to go. I </info>
    <info>looked around, but I saw few choices and opportunities. I knew I could </info>
    <info>do more. I wanted a good job just like my brothers, Patrick and Jamie. </info>
    <info>I decided to create my own--my own job. I told my dad that I wanted--I </info>
    <info>wanted to go into business with him. I came up with the idea to sell </info>
    <info>crazy socks because I had always worn and loved colorful and fun socks. </info>
    <info>We opened John's Crazy Socks in December 2016. We were entrepreneurs </info>
    <info>and we took a chance.</info>
    <info>    Now everyone wears my socks, even the movie stars, prime ministers </info>
    <info>and presidents. We have created 35 jobs and 18 of my colleagues have a </info>
    <info>different ability. We make films that have been seen over 4 million </info>
    <info>times. We have raised over $135,000 for our charity partners. We are </info>
    <info>making John's Crazy Socks a success, and we owe it to our colleagues. I </info>
    <info>can be in my own business because I had a great teacher. I want to do a </info>
    <info>shout-out to Dr. Erica Murphy-Jesson and Patricia Klee, my speech </info>
    <info>teacher. I can lead my own business because I played Special Olympic </info>
    <info>sports. I can lead my own business because my dad gave me a chance.</info>
    <info>    I want you to know what people like me can do. Give us a chance and </info>
    <info>watch what we can do. [Applause.]</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Thank you, John. I'm so glad that you took that </info>
    <info>business risk and had the courage to create your own opportunity </info>
    <info>because it is changing the world.</info>
    <info>    Mr. J. Cronin. Thank you so much.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Next we have Mark X. Cronin, who is the co-founder of </info>
    <info>John's Crazy Socks along with John. He serves as the business's </info>
    <info>president and developed the social enterprise model for the business. </info>
    <info>Mark spent much of his earlier career in the health care field leading </info>
    <info>management and technology firms seeking to improve health care to the </info>
    <info>poor and strengthen doctor-patient relations. He's also led political </info>
    <info>campaigns, published numerous short stories, and taught school.</info>
    <info>    Mark.</info>
    <info>    Mr. M. Cronin. Good afternoon. My name is Mark X. Cronin. As you've </info>
    <info>heard, I'm John's father and partner in our business, John's Crazy </info>
    <info>Socks.</info>
    <info>    We are here today to share some best practices, or at least our </info>
    <info>practices, of working with people with differing abilities. And what we </info>
    <info>do in our business is simple: We want to show what's possible, we want </info>
    <info>to show what people with differing abilities can do if given a chance.</info>
    <info>    In John's Crazy Socks, we have built a social enterprise, so we </info>
    <info>have a social mission and a business mission and they're indivisible. </info>
    <info>Our social mission shows the world what people with differing abilities </info>
    <info>can do and we give back by supporting and raising money for our charity </info>
    <info>partners, like the National Down Syndrome Society. But we can only </info>
    <info>succeed if we run a rigorous business. We compete with some of the </info>
    <info>world's largest and best companies--Amazon, Walmart, Target--and we </info>
    <info>must match or beat what they do. For us to do good, we have to do well.</info>
    <info>    And that's why we hire people with differing abilities. Doing so </info>
    <info>serves our social mission, but it also serves our business mission. To </info>
    <info>succeed, we have to provide great service. We do same-day shipping. We </info>
    <info>make sure our customers are happy. And we hire people with differing </info>
    <info>abilities because they help us run that great business. We do not hire </info>
    <info>out of charity or altruism; we hire because it is good business.</info>
    <info>    John told you that we have been fortunate enough to create 35 jobs </info>
    <info>with 18 held by people with differing abilities. Our starting pay is </info>
    <info>$12 an hour, $1 more than the New York State minimum wage. Our </info>
    <info>colleagues do not do minimum work, so we do not offer minimum pay.</info>
    <info>    Too often, people with differing abilities are not offered jobs or </info>
    <info>they can only find work in sheltered workshops. They might be offered </info>
    <info>positions out of pity or charity. Our business demonstrates that people </info>
    <info>with differing abilities are just like the rest of us. They want </info>
    <info>meaningful work where they can make a contribution and receive fair </info>
    <info>pay. After all, that's how we got started.</info>
    <info>    When John was finishing school, healthy and ready to go, he did not </info>
    <info>see many choices and the entrepreneur in him said great, I'll create my </info>
    <info>own job. What does it take to hire people with differing abilities? We </info>
    <info>simply need to focus on what people can do, not what they cannot do. </info>
    <info>Match the skills of the worker to the job.</info>
    <info>    We operate a pick-and-pack warehouse. Our warehouse workers--we </info>
    <info>call them sock wranglers--those with differing abilities and </info>
    <info>neurotypicals all pass a test to prove they can do the job. No charity, </info>
    <info>just real work.</info>
    <info>    We have no government support. We have no special programs. Yes, we </info>
    <info>make accommodations for our differently abled, but we also make </info>
    <info>accommodations for our neurotypical employees. We have created a </info>
    <info>unified workplace where people of differing abilities work side-by-side </info>
    <info>neurotypical employees. And everyone benefits. We have better </info>
    <info>productivity, better morale, better retention.</info>
    <info>    And yet, we're talking about best practices. Small accommodations </info>
    <info>can make a difference. We make sure everyone has an email address and </info>
    <info>knows how to use email, even if they're not working with a computer. We </info>
    <info>give everyone a business card as a symbol of their professionalism and </info>
    <info>we watch as they give that out proudly to family and friends. We </info>
    <info>schedule regular social events outside of the office for all of our </info>
    <info>staff, like attending a chamber of commerce dinner. Having a job gives </info>
    <info>our employees standing in the community. And these are small </info>
    <info>initiatives, but they have a big impact on our differently abled </info>
    <info>population.</info>
    <info>    We have learned that hiring the differently abled gives us a </info>
    <info>competitive advantage. The United States and other industrialized </info>
    <info>nations are now facing shortages of workers, and yet we have this </info>
    <info>great, untapped, natural resource in the differently abled. Employers </info>
    <info>will learn that those with differing abilities are an asset, not a </info>
    <info>liability, and the employers who learn this lesson the fastest will be </info>
    <info>at an advantage and have greater success.</info>
    <info>    Our governments need to change, too. We need to see the differently </info>
    <info>abled as full-fledged citizens, people able to contribute, not helpless </info>
    <info>beings who need pity. We need laws that guarantee the same rights, </info>
    <info>including the same wages, as the neurotypical population. Here in the </info>
    <info>United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938--which is anything </info>
    <info>but fair--allows employers to pay people with disabilities less than a </info>
    <info>minimum wage. Just because you can pay people less does not make it </info>
    <info>right. And it may make you some extra money, but it will leave you </info>
    <info>morally bankrupt. We are working with the National Down Syndrome </info>
    <info>Society to support passage of the TIME Act to afford all people a fair </info>
    <info>and minimum wage in the U.S. and elsewhere.</info>
    <info>    We have benefit programs that limit the ability of the disabled to </info>
    <info>work. Many of our colleagues who are differently abled can only work </info>
    <info>part time. Why? Because if they work too many hours they will lose </info>
    <info>their Medicaid and they cannot afford to do so. Take Aliya, one of our </info>
    <info>colleagues who has a form of autism and works as a sock wrangler. Aliya </info>
    <info>does a great job and would love to work 40 hours a week, but cannot </info>
    <info>because she cannot afford to lose her Medicaid. Don't we all want Aliya </info>
    <info>to work full time? Then why have laws that limit how much she can work?</info>
    <info>    And my son, John--he does not receive benefits yet; however, when </info>
    <info>he needs those benefits in the future, he will need to choose between </info>
    <info>his benefits and the equity in the company he created. Do we want to </info>
    <info>prevent people from engaging in entrepreneurship?</info>
    <info>    It is time to decouple the poor from the disabled in our means-</info>
    <info>tested programs so that people with differing abilities can work full </info>
    <info>time and maximize their contributions to society. We want to encourage </info>
    <info>people to work and to pay taxes, so let's remove the disincentives.</info>
    <info>    In the end, our message is simple: It is good business to hire </info>
    <info>people with differing abilities. John created his own future when he </info>
    <info>created John's Crazy Socks. We need more businesses that offer a future </info>
    <info>of meaningful work to all people. Employers here in the U.S. and around </info>
    <info>the world will come to learn that people with differing abilities make </info>
    <info>great employees.</info>
    <info>    John and I, we're a couple of simple guys from Long Island. We're a </info>
    <info>couple of knuckleheads selling socks. [Laughter.] We have no special </info>
    <info>training. We have no special talents. If we can do this, anyone can. No </info>
    <info>more excuses. Let's show the world what's possible.</info>
    <info>    Mr. J. Cronin. I love you, dad.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Thank you, Mark. Thank you for your vision and creating </info>
    <info>a very successful business and social enterprise model for the rest of </info>
    <info>us to take note of and follow.</info>
    <info>    You mentioned in your statement that the minimum wage floor does </info>
    <info>not apply to individuals with intellectual disabilities at this point. </info>
    <info>And there is a bill that's been introduced called the TIME Act that </info>
    <info>will address that issue. Will that bill also address the issue of part-</info>
    <info>time work, which you also mentioned, meaning individuals with </info>
    <info>intellectual disabilities who do not have the option to work full time </info>
    <info>and keep their benefits? Or will that be addressed by different </info>
    <info>legislation?</info>
    <info>    And, Sarah, please feel free to jump in.</info>
    <info>    Mr. M. Cronin. Well, I mean, Sarah's more of the expert than me. </info>
    <info>The TIME Act will only prevent employers from paying people less than </info>
    <info>minimum wage. To change that issue about the limits on what people can </info>
    <info>work, the ABLE Act changes some of that on the margin, but that's a </info>
    <info>fundamental change that would have to--we would have to change the way </info>
    <info>we provide health insurance to working people who are disabled.</info>
    <info>    And the reason it's critical, Medicaid covers more than what </info>
    <info>traditional health insurance pays. So even if you have traditional </info>
    <info>health insurance, there are some benefits that are crucial to many </info>
    <info>people with disabilities that they can only get through Medicaid.</info>
    <info>    But, Sarah, you know, you're the expert on this.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Weir. Sure. It's actually one of the main reasons we launched </info>
    <info>our Law Syndrome campaign last October. And Mark pointed this out in </info>
    <info>his testimony and it's exactly what we're trying to achieve with the </info>
    <info>work we do at the National Down Syndrome Society, and that's, </info>
    <info>essentially, we need to decouple the poor from the disabled in these </info>
    <info>means-tested programs.</info>
    <info>    We still have very obsolete income and asset limitations that exist </info>
    <info>as far back as the 1960s and 1970s that prevent individuals with Down </info>
    <info>syndrome and other disabilities from keeping what they can earn and </info>
    <info>what they can save. ABLE was a huge step forward and it doesn't solve </info>
    <info>all of our issues, but it created a financial tool, a 529A or a 529 </info>
    <info>ABLE account to allow individuals with disabilities to save their money </info>
    <info>in an ABLE account without putting benefits in jeopardy.</info>
    <info>    Now, really, our focus on the employment side is to address the </info>
    <info>archaic, outdated income limitations. And we really feel at the </info>
    <info>National Down Syndrome Society and with the partnership of businesses, </info>
    <info>like John's Crazy Socks, $800 billion corporations like Voya Financial, </info>
    <info>from Main Street to Wall Street, the way to do that is to essentially </info>
    <info>eliminate the ability to pay people with disabilities far below minimum </info>
    <info>wage. The TIME Act is one example. We know that there are other efforts </info>
    <info>here on the Senate side to introduce new legislation to address this. </info>
    <info>And then we're exploring opportunities to address this administratively </info>
    <info>with the administration and look at ways to make sure that no new 14(c) </info>
    <info>certificate holders are created in a time when the supply and demand </info>
    <info>for sheltered workshops are the lowest it's been in, you know, recent </info>
    <info>decades.</info>
    <info>    So there's multiple ways to do this. But from an equality and a </info>
    <info>human rights perspective, I think there's nothing more discriminatory </info>
    <info>than a 1938 provision that tells somebody who was born with Down </info>
    <info>syndrome that you're far less valued in an employment setting than </info>
    <info>anybody else.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Thank you. We'll have to probably take the additional </info>
    <info>bills up in the next Congress because we're coming to the end of this </info>
    <info>Congress. But it sounds like there's some great work still to be done.</info>
    <info>    I wanted to ask John, what is a typical day like for you at John's </info>
    <info>Crazy Socks?</info>
    <info>    Mr. J. Cronin. When I get at work, I do--I handle all the--I do </info>
    <info>videos. I do a bunch of videos, like I tell you new ones and call it </info>
    <info>John's networking. We're doing--we're doing ``Mad Science,'' a ``Mad </info>
    <info>Science'' show. [Inaudible.] And we're doing ``Cooking Up Happiness.'' </info>
    <info>I'm doing it with a guest with differing abilities on ``Cooking Up </info>
    <info>Happiness.''</info>
    <info>    Mr. M. Cronin. So it's videos that you do.</info>
    <info>    Mr. J. Cronin. I do a--there's a video. I do a--I'm pulling--I'm </info>
    <info>pulling sock records. I help pick out socks, every order. And after </info>
    <info>that, I'm doing a video order or a video of that, and I write personal </info>
    <info>notes, personal videos, all that. I'm doing a big engagement right now. </info>
    <info>I'm just having fun.</info>
    <info>    And my--and mostly I like making home deliveries. If fun things are </info>
    <info>going on--and I--[inaudible]--candy, and thinking of it is something </info>
    <info>sweet.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Thank you, John. It sounds like you have a very busy </info>
    <info>day doing public relations, merchandising and shipping for the socks.</info>
    <info>    And do you typically work part time, full time, does it vary from </info>
    <info>week to week depending on how busy things are?</info>
    <info>    Mr. J. Cronin. Actually, I'm going to tell you I have work when I--</info>
    <info>when I--I'm an entrepreneur, me and my dad. When we get up, we get in </info>
    <info>the office around 9. And some nights--some nights, around 6, 7 at </info>
    <info>night. We work--me and my dad work long hours. And I tell you that </info>
    <info>because we're going two more years. We're going on vacation in two more </info>
    <info>years. We're entrepreneurs. [Laughter.]</info>
    <info>    Mr. M. Cronin. So we work hard, huh?</info>
    <info>    Mr. J. Cronin. We work very hard and so it's very appreciated.</info>
    <info>    Mr. M. Cronin. But you like it?</info>
    <info>    Mr. J. Cronin. But, yes, I like it. [Laughter.] Yes.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Thank you, John.</info>
    <info>    Kayla, I had a question for you. You mentioned in your testimony </info>
    <info>that ``I am who I am today in large part because I was included with my </info>
    <info>peers throughout my childhood.''</info>
    <info>    Ms. McKeon. Correct.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. And I'm wondering, what are your best memories of </info>
    <info>inclusion during your childhood? And what are also your memories of </info>
    <info>times when you wish you had been included more in your childhood?</info>
    <info>    Ms. McKeon. You're making me think . . . It's been a while. I </info>
    <info>remember being in a classroom with a special education teacher and I </info>
    <info>didn't have a one-on-one yet. But I will probably get a one-on-one </info>
    <info>after I--sorry to say this--but I went into the woods. I was--I behaved </info>
    <info>like I shouldn't when I was little. And so I have this bad memory, but </info>
    <info>it was part to get a one-on-one that helped me gain independence, it </info>
    <info>helped me build the skills I needed to get up to where everybody else </info>
    <info>was.</info>
    <info>    And back then, I was in high school and I still had this one-on-one </info>
    <info>who had to hold my hand in the hallways. I said, um, no, thank you, </info>
    <info>we're going backward, I don't want to backpedal, I'm independent and I </info>
    <info>can cross a hallway on my own. Well, they thought I needed that extra </info>
    <info>help where I did not need it, but I needed the help in the classroom </info>
    <info>where they were able to break down the instructions, make it easier for </info>
    <info>me to learn. And doing things more hands-on helped me greatly. So I'm </info>
    <info>not saying it was a bad memory, but it helped get that one-on-one that </info>
    <info>I needed to propel me to work harder.</info>
    <info>    And one of my one-on-ones was Ms. Powers who helped me to be more </info>
    <info>independent and got me into a club in school that I really enjoyed. And </info>
    <info>again, it helped with the independence.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Sounds like you had the extra support when you needed </info>
    <info>it, but also the freedom to say I can stand on my own two feet now, </info>
    <info>thank you, when you didn't need it. So I'm glad to hear that.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Lazarus, I wanted to dig deeper into how teachers can be better </info>
    <info>prepared to instruct students with the most significant cognitive </info>
    <info>disabilities when they're trying to create an inclusive setting and the </info>
    <info>student may need quite a bit of extra support.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Lazarus. What we've found is that the students, they understand </info>
    <info>each other. They want to work together, they want to be friends, they </info>
    <info>want to be colleagues. But it's often the adults who can get in the </info>
    <info>way. And teachers all, I truly believe, every single teacher out there </info>
    <info>wants what is best for students. And they also want what they--they </info>
    <info>want to feel like they are successful as teachers. And when they lack </info>
    <info>the skills to instruct some of their students, then they start </info>
    <info>thinking, well, maybe this isn't a good fit for this child.</info>
    <info>    So what we really need is to create schools where all teachers have </info>
    <info>the confidence that they can successfully instruct all students. And so </info>
    <info>to get this, it involves teacher prep programs where all educators have </info>
    <info>the opportunity to instruct, learn how to instruct the widest range of </info>
    <info>students, the development of instructional materials and resources that </info>
    <info>are easy to use and can be used with students across the range of </info>
    <info>students.</info>
    <info>    We also need to think about administrators and how they might </info>
    <info>support inclusion and the importance of all people in the school taking </info>
    <info>responsibility for the learning of all students. Too often we have </info>
    <info>silos that the special educator does this and the general educator does </info>
    <info>that, and if we can combine where everyone in the school cares about </info>
    <info>all students, then we will have much better places.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Thank you, Dr. Lazarus.</info>
    <info>    Before we run out of time, I want to make sure that we leave some </info>
    <info>time for any questions from the audience or online as the case may be.</info>
    <info>    I'll give you a moment to think while I follow up with Dr. Lazarus.</info>
    <info>    How does being included in regular classrooms with peers without </info>
    <info>disabilities help prepare students for better quality outcomes for </info>
    <info>adult life? Why is this a key goal?</info>
    <info>    Dr. Lazarus. The early inclusion supports later inclusion. Early </info>
    <info>segregation almost ensures that there will be segregation later in </info>
    <info>life. That's so important to think about, what do we want in our </info>
    <info>communities, in our country? And when we think about our schools are </info>
    <info>preparing our future corporate leaders, our future civic leaders, our </info>
    <info>faith leaders, and if those individuals are comfortable with--familiar </info>
    <info>with--individuals who have a wide variety of characteristics, whether </info>
    <info>it be ethnic diversity, English learners or individuals with </info>
    <info>significant cognitive disabilities, we are creating communities that </info>
    <info>value all individuals. And I just see inclusion right from the get-go </info>
    <info>as being a really important part of that.</info>
    <info>    Mr. M. Cronin. If I could add to that--you know, at a personal </info>
    <info>level and in our business. So John is the youngest of three sons. John </info>
    <info>benefited from his older brothers leading him and taking care of him. </info>
    <info>But his older brothers benefited from John and they are better people </info>
    <info>because of it. And in our workplace--so we have this unified workplace. </info>
    <info>We see minor miracles every day with our differently abled. But our </info>
    <info>neurotypical staff, they're better off, they're happier. And that </info>
    <info>diversity that we bring benefits the business. So everyone--it's not </info>
    <info>that inclusion doesn't just benefit the differently abled, it benefits </info>
    <info>everybody.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Lazarus. And I totally agree with Mark. That is just so, so </info>
    <info>true.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Weir. Well, and I echo both what Dr. Lazarus and Mark said. But </info>
    <info>I think it comes down to the treatment of people with disabilities. It </info>
    <info>should be no different than anyone else. The way and the reason we </info>
    <info>fight for inclusion for students with Down syndrome is so they have </info>
    <info>access to the general curriculum, they have access to a great </info>
    <info>education. And the expectation when they graduate from high school or </info>
    <info>college needs to be employment, just like everyone else.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. We have run out of time, unless there's a burning </info>
    <info>question from the audience.</info>
    <info>    And if not, I will thank the panelists for bringing us both </info>
    <info>tangible examples as well as the challenges of creating a truly </info>
    <info>inclusive society. I am so encouraged by the success that you are, </info>
    <info>Kayla, the success that you are, John, and the success that you are </info>
    <info>encouraging amongst your peers and urging others in your life to </info>
    <info>achieve by changing laws that are holding you back. And so I thank you </info>
    <info>for being here today. Thank you for your insights.</info>
    <info>    And I hope that everyone in the audience will join me in thanking </info>
    <info>them. [Applause.]</info>
    <info>    Ms. McKeon. And thank you for having all of us. We very much </info>
    <info>appreciate it.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Parker. Our pleasure.</info>
    <info>    [Whereupon, at 4:36 p.m., the briefing ended.]</info>

    <info>    =======================================================================</info>
    <info>    Good afternoon. My name is Sara Hart Weir, and I am the President </info>
    <info>and CEO of the world's largest Down syndrome advocacy organization--the </info>
    <info>National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS).</info>
    <info>    On behalf of NDSS, the leading human rights organization for all </info>
    <info>individuals with Down syndrome, it is an honor to sit at this table </info>
    <info>(today) to present to the Helsinki Commission with Dr. Lazarus, one of </info>
    <info>our favorite NDSS #DSWORKS&#4; partners, Mark and John Cronin, from John's </info>
    <info>Crazy Socks and of course, my esteemed colleague, Kayla McKeon.</info>
    <info>    At NDSS, we believe if you're not at the table, you're on the menu. </info>
    <info>I, personally, want to thank the Helsinki Commission, for today's </info>
    <info>imperative discussion and lending a critical voice to a population, </info>
    <info>even in our great nation, the United States of America, and still in </info>
    <info>2018, that is far more discriminated against more than any other </info>
    <info>community.</info>
    <info>    Today's topic--``A TRULY INCLUSIVE SOCIETY: ENCOURAGING THE ABILITY </info>
    <info>IN DISABILITY'' is something we live and breathe at the National Down </info>
    <info>Syndrome Society--as we strive to achieve equality for all Americans </info>
    <info>with Down syndrome in the U.S.</info>
    <info>    Our great nation's first mottos--``E Pluribus Unum''--is embedded </info>
    <info>in almost every fabric of our country's rich history. The phrase is </info>
    <info>used on our currency, the seal of the President, Vice President, United </info>
    <info>States Congress, of the United States House of Representatives, of the </info>
    <info>United States Senate and on the seal of the United States Supreme </info>
    <info>Court. It is cemented in our country's rich history, culture and </info>
    <info>values--life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness--e pluribus unum </info>
    <info>comes from the Latin phrase meaning ``OUT of many, ONE.''</info>
    <info>    From this belief, springs a unifying purpose for our nation. </info>
    <info>Equality. Unfortunately, in the United States, and around the world </info>
    <info>people with Down syndrome and other disabilities are not treated as </info>
    <info>one.</info>
    <info>    At NDSS, we believe no matter your differences or abilities you </info>
    <info>should have a fair shot at the American Dream--and we work hard each </info>
    <info>and every day to ensure America's motto is upheld for people with Down </info>
    <info>syndrome and that ONE truly means ONE.</info>
    <info>    At NDSS, \1/4\ of our staff have Down syndrome and work across all </info>
    <info>of our programs and departments. Not a single decision within our </info>
    <info>organization is made without the input of our self-advocates. At NDSS, </info>
    <info>our programs, including:</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  our National Advocacy and Public Policy Center</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  our #DSWORKS&#4; Employment Program--our Health Promotion </info>
    <info>and Resources Program</info>
    <info>    These programs are dedicated to advancing proactive policies and </info>
    <info>providing invaluable resources on issues across the lifespan, from </info>
    <info>birth to old age, across five critical pillars: healthcare and </info>
    <info>research, education, employment, community integration and economic </info>
    <info>self-sufficiency.</info>
    <info>    Next year, we will celebrate NDSS' 40th anniversary. During this </info>
    <info>time, one of the most important advancements for individuals with Down </info>
    <info>syndrome has been an increased access to and advancements in </info>
    <info>healthcare. The result is a dramatic increase in life expectancy of </info>
    <info>individuals with Down syndrome from 25 years old in 1983, \1\ to about </info>
    <info>60 years old today \2\--all a result of early detection of co-occurring </info>
    <info>conditions like congenital heart defects, quality dental care and of </info>
    <info>course, inclusion.</info>

    <info>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</info>
    <info>    From its origins in 1979, NDSS has been involved in so many federal </info>
    <info>and state advocacy as well as judicial efforts that have helped </info>
    <info>individuals with all disabilities become more included in society:</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Public </info>
    <info>Law 101-476), or ``IDEA'' that guarantees students with disabilities </info>
    <info>their right to be educated alongside their peers in their neighborhood </info>
    <info>school;</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  The Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-336), </info>
    <info>or ``ADA,'' that prohibits discrimination against individuals with </info>
    <info>disabilities in all areas of public life and the subsequent Olmstead </info>
    <info>Supreme Court decision that requires public agencies to provide </info>
    <info>services in the most integrated settings possible;</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  The shutdown of the Willowbrook Institution in New York </info>
    <info>that was brought to the forefront of the public's conscious; and</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  The landmark passage of the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a </info>
    <info>Better Life Experience Act (Public Law 113-295), best known as the </info>
    <info>``ABLE Act,'' that allows individuals with disabilities to save money </info>
    <info>without it affecting their benefits.</info>
    <info>    These accomplishments and milestones were vital to ensure </info>
    <info>individuals with disabilities have access and adequate supports to the </info>
    <info>basic liberties those without disabilities enjoy--education, community </info>
    <info>integration, housing, employment and savings.</info>
    <info>    Despite these significant advancements, we have a long way to go. </info>
    <info>People with Down syndrome are still held back and confined to laws that </info>
    <info>were put in place as long ago as the 1930's--a time where the life </info>
    <info>expectancy rate was very, very low, a time when we were still </info>
    <info>institutionalizing people with Down syndrome and perceptions of the </info>
    <info>people with Down syndrome were not even realized.</info>
    <info>    Today:</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  Individuals with disabilities still do not have access to </info>
    <info>marriage equality</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  Individuals with disabilities cannot maintain their vital </info>
    <info>benefits while working, despite being ready, willing and able to work</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  Though we fought for IDEA, many students still do not </info>
    <info>have access to the inclusive education to which they are entitled and </info>
    <info>is the basis of a life of inclusion</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  Many cannot choose where they want to live as housing </info>
    <info>options for individuals with Intellectual and Developmental </info>
    <info>Disabilities especially are extremely limited</info>
    <info>    &lt;bullet&gt;  Many are still not economically self-sufficient despite </info>
    <info>ABLE accounts being open to qualifying individuals across the nation</info>
    <info>    Outrageously, many are still not getting paid the minimum wage that </info>
    <info>all other Americans are entitled to. Under Section 14(c) of the Fair </info>
    <info>Labor Standards Act (of 1938), businesses can obtain a special wage </info>
    <info>certificate from the Department of Labor to pay individuals with </info>
    <info>disabilities below minimum wage, sometimes as little as thirty cents an </info>
    <info>hour--the only group of people it is still legal to pay below minimum </info>
    <info>wage. For purposes of conscious, inclusion and equality, this is </info>
    <info>unacceptable.</info>
    <info>    Last year, NDSS launched our campaign to end #LawSyndrome to draw </info>
    <info>attention to these issues and advocate for change. Down syndrome </info>
    <info>doesn't hold anyone back but rather these antiquated laws prevent </info>
    <info>individuals from fulfilling their potential. We will not stop until </info>
    <info>every single American with Down syndrome has the same rights as every </info>
    <info>other American.</info>
    <info>    One of my proudest accomplishments at NDSS is ensuring that </info>
    <info>individuals with Down syndrome are not only part of our incredible team </info>
    <info>and organization, but they are at every table where key decisions about </info>
    <info>their future are made. When you have a seat at the table, you have a </info>
    <info>say in the decisions that are made and when it's your table, you make </info>
    <info>the decisions--this is how we end #LawSyndrome. I am honored to </info>
    <info>introduce my colleague who has not only earned a seat the table--she </info>
    <info>owns the table and Capitol Hill.</info>
    <info>    Good afternoon, everyone. To echo Sara's words, thank you to </info>
    <info>Allison and the Helsinki Commission for inviting me to speak.</info>
    <info>    My name is Kayla McKeon and I am the Manager of Grassroots Advocacy </info>
    <info>at the National Down Syndrome Society. I am the first registered </info>
    <info>lobbyist who just happens to have Down syndrome. Down syndrome doesn't </info>
    <info>define me, Kayla, and it definitely does not stop me. What limits me </info>
    <info>and my fellow advocates and friends with Down syndrome and other </info>
    <info>disabilities across our great country is Law Syndrome.</info>
    <info>    As Sara mentioned, Law Syndrome is a series of VERY old laws that </info>
    <info>were passed when I wouldn't have lived past my adolescence or even my </info>
    <info>childhood, and if I did, I would not have left the hospital with my </info>
    <info>parents because people with Down syndrome were still being </info>
    <info>institutionalized. These laws were put in place when the social </info>
    <info>acceptance of individuals with disabilities was at an all-time low.</info>
    <info>    I was lucky in my upbringing in Syracuse, New York. When I was 18 </info>
    <info>months old, my parents enrolled me in an early education program. I </info>
    <info>progressed through school alongside my classmates and graduated at age </info>
    <info>18. As soon as inclusive education became possible, I was always in an </info>
    <info>inclusive setting. I won't deny there were bumps and stumbling blocks </info>
    <info>along the way, but my parents always thought it was best for me to be </info>
    <info>included with my classmates and placed in settings that challenged me </info>
    <info>to reach my highest potential. There were times when they pushed me, </info>
    <info>but it was always because they knew I could succeed.</info>
    <info>    I earned awards in eighth and ninth grade for character, </info>
    <info>commitment, courage, English and math. My final grade for algebra was </info>
    <info>in the 90's and I got a 93 on my math regents' exam. If you are from </info>
    <info>New York, you know how tough that was.</info>
    <info>    Later, an agency known as Vocational &amp; Educational Services for </info>
    <info>Individuals with Disabilities, or VESID, and my high school set up a </info>
    <info>program for me to take an office technology program. It was a six-month </info>
    <info>certification program for adults. They arranged the program for me to </info>
    <info>go through it twice. I passed the program, earned the certificate and, </info>
    <info>as a result, I am pretty fast on a keyboard. I was even the </info>
    <info>commencement speaker.</info>
    <info>    I also attended Onondaga Community College taking some non-credit </info>
    <info>courses, but I thought to myself, it doesn't make sense that I'm doing </info>
    <info>all the work without earning any credits! But I liked the classes, so I </info>
    <info>began taking one course per semester for credit. I can happily say I am </info>
    <info>now more than halfway to earning my associate's degree. I start back up </info>
    <info>later this month. I love taking classes with my peers. Many of my </info>
    <info>classmates are a little bit younger than me now, but so what! I started </info>
    <info>advocating a number of years ago. I started educating others who are </info>
    <info>differently abled by going to elementary schools, then moved on to </info>
    <info>middle schools, colleges and the school of nursing. I try to motivate </info>
    <info>them to do the best that they can do. My message to kids in school is </info>
    <info>to persevere. I am who I am today in large part because I was included </info>
    <info>with my peers throughout my childhood.</info>
    <info>    One day in Syracuse, I met John Katko at a baseball game. He was </info>
    <info>running for the U.S. House of Representatives. He handed me his </info>
    <info>business card so I handed him mine. He called me later and said if he </info>
    <info>was elected he wanted me to come and work for him. When he won, I </info>
    <info>became an intern in his Syracuse office. I represented him at different </info>
    <info>events and did office work. In June of last year, he asked me to go </info>
    <info>with him to a disability conference in Washington. We didn't realize at </info>
    <info>the time it was with the National Down Syndrome Society. It was there </info>
    <info>at the end of the meeting that Sara Hart Weir, our President and CEO of </info>
    <info>NDSS, offered me the job of Manager of Grassroots Advocacy. I started </info>
    <info>last October.</info>
    <info>    With my position as the first registered lobbyist with Down </info>
    <info>syndrome, I go to Capitol Hill and speak to many Members of Congress </info>
    <info>and their staff on issues that are important to me. I helped lobby to </info>
    <info>pass the original ABLE Act as a volunteer for NDSS and now the ABLE to </info>
    <info>Work Act and the ABLE Financial Planning Act as a lobbyist. These laws </info>
    <info>allow me and my friends who are differently-abled to have savings </info>
    <info>accounts and meaningful employment without giving up our benefits.</info>
    <info>    We are now tirelessly working on ending #LawSyndrome. Down syndrome </info>
    <info>doesn't stop us. It never stopped us. It is just some old, antiquated </info>
    <info>laws that hold us back. One example is the 80-year-old provision within </info>
    <info>the Fair Labor Standards Act known as Section 14(c) that Sara </info>
    <info>mentioned. People like me are still getting paid cents an hour, while </info>
    <info>other individuals performing the same tasks are paid at least minimum </info>
    <info>wage. These issues segregate us from the rest of society. They show we </info>
    <info>are still viewed as ``less than.'' Society is ready to move past these </info>
    <info>laws. When will the government catch up?</info>
    <info>    We have a long way to go for individuals with Down syndrome to be </info>
    <info>fully included in society. To me, having Down syndrome is who I am but </info>
    <info>it has never stopped me for achieving my own hopes, dreams and </info>
    <info>passions. What I want for my life and all individuals with disabilities </info>
    <info>is for us all to be treated just like everyone else. I want to live the </info>
    <info>American Dream.</info>

    <info>    Good afternoon. My name is John Cronin, and I am the co-founder and </info>
    <info>Chief Happiness Officer of John's Crazy Socks. I come here to stand up </info>
    <info>for people with Down syndrome and all people with differing abilities.</info>
    <info>    I have Down syndrome and Down syndrome never holds me back. I am </info>
    <info>22-years old and work hard every day to show the world that people with </info>
    <info>Down syndrome are ready, willing and able to work. Give us a chance and </info>
    <info>we can be successful.</info>
    <info>    You may have heard about John's Crazy Socks. We have a mission to </info>
    <info>spread happiness. We have a good story, but we are a good business too. </info>
    <info>We offer 2,300 different socks. We have shipped our socks to every </info>
    <info>state and 80 different countries. This year we will ship over 170,000 </info>
    <info>orders and earn over $6 million. I may be cute, but I run a serious </info>
    <info>business.</info>
    <info>    I started this business with my dad, Mark. It was my idea and I </info>
    <info>came up with the name. My Dad believed in me and gave me a chance. I </info>
    <info>love my Dad. I work hard every day. I love my business.</info>
    <info>    Let me tell you why I started John's Crazy Socks. In the fall of </info>
    <info>2016, I began my last year of school. I needed to decide what I would </info>
    <info>do when school ended. I had received a good education at Huntington </info>
    <info>High School. I was healthy and ready to go. I looked around but saw few </info>
    <info>choices and opportunities. I knew I could do more. I wanted a good job </info>
    <info>just like my brothers Patrick and Jamie.</info>
    <info>    I decided to create my own job. I told my dad that I wanted to go </info>
    <info>into business with him. I came up with the idea to sell crazy socks </info>
    <info>because I had always worn and loved colorful and fun socks. We opened </info>
    <info>John's Crazy Socks in December 2016. We were entrepreneurs and we took </info>
    <info>a chance. Now, everyone wears my socks, even movie stars, Prime </info>
    <info>Ministers and Presidents.</info>
    <info>    We have created 35 jobs and 18 of my colleagues have a differing </info>
    <info>ability. We make videos that have been seen over 4 million times. We </info>
    <info>have raised over $150,000 for our charity partners. We are making </info>
    <info>John's Crazy Socks a success and we owe it to our colleagues.</info>
    <info>    I can lead my own business because I had great teachers. I want to </info>
    <info>shout out to Dr. Erica Murphy-Jessen and Patricia Klee, my speech </info>
    <info>teacher. I can lead my own business because I played Special Olympics </info>
    <info>sports. I can lead my own business because my Dad gave me a chance.</info>
    <info>    I want you to know what people like me can do. Give us a chance and </info>
    <info>watch what we can do.</info>
    <info>    Good afternoon. My name is Mark X. Cronin and I am John's father </info>
    <info>and partner in John's Crazy Socks. We work to show what is possible, we </info>
    <info>work to show what people with a differing ability can do if given a </info>
    <info>chance.</info>
    <info>    In John's Crazy Socks, we have built a social enterprise; we have a </info>
    <info>social and a business mission and they are indivisible. Our social </info>
    <info>mission shows the world what people with a differing ability can do and </info>
    <info>we give back by supporting and raising money for our charity partners. </info>
    <info>But we can only succeed if we run a rigorous business. We compete with </info>
    <info>some of the largest and best companies in the world--Amazon, Wal-mart </info>
    <info>and Target--and we must match or beat what they offer. To do good, we </info>
    <info>have to do well.</info>
    <info>    Hiring people with differing abilities serves our social mission, </info>
    <info>but it also serves our business mission. To succeed, we must provide </info>
    <info>great service, so we do same day shipping and that makes our customers </info>
    <info>happy. We hire people with differing abilities because they help us </info>
    <info>fulfill our mission. We do not hire people out of charity or altruism. </info>
    <info>We hire because it is good for business.</info>
    <info>    John told you that we have been fortunate enough to create 35 jobs </info>
    <info>with 18 held by people with differing abilities. Our starting pay is </info>
    <info>$12 per hour, $1 more than the New York State minimum wage. Our </info>
    <info>colleagues do not do minimum work, so we do not offer minimum pay. The </info>
    <info>sad reality is that we could pay less, much less, and many of our </info>
    <info>workers and their families would still welcome the job because </info>
    <info>meaningful work is so scarce. But that would be wrong. Taking advantage </info>
    <info>of vulnerable workers may put money in the bank, but it would be </info>
    <info>morally bankrupt.</info>
    <info>    Too often, people with differing abilities are not offered jobs or </info>
    <info>they can only find work in sheltered workshops. They might be offered </info>
    <info>positions out of pity or charity. Our business demonstrates that people </info>
    <info>with differing abilities are just like the rest of us: they want </info>
    <info>meaningful work where they can make a contribution and receive fair </info>
    <info>pay.</info>
    <info>    What does it take to hire people with differing abilities? We </info>
    <info>simply need to focus on what people can do, not what they cannot do. </info>
    <info>Match the skills of the worker to the job. We operate a pick and pack </info>
    <info>warehouse. Our warehouse workers--those with differing abilities and </info>
    <info>neuro-typical--all pass a test to prove they can do the job. No </info>
    <info>charity, just real work.</info>
    <info>    We have no government support and no special programs. Yes, we make </info>
    <info>accommodations for our differing abled, but we also make accommodations </info>
    <info>for our neuro-typical employees. We have created a unified workplace </info>
    <info>where people of differing abilities work side-by-side with neuro-</info>
    <info>typical employees. And everyone benefits. We have better productivity, </info>
    <info>better morale and better retention.</info>
    <info>    And yet small accommodations can make a big difference. We make </info>
    <info>sure everyone has an email address and knows how to use email. We give </info>
    <info>everyone a business card as a symbol of their professionalism and watch </info>
    <info>as they proudly give them out to family and friends. And we schedule </info>
    <info>regular social events outside the office for all of our staff like </info>
    <info>attending a Chamber of Commerce dinner. Having a job gives our </info>
    <info>employees standing it the community. These are small initiatives, but </info>
    <info>they have a big impact on our differing abled population.</info>
    <info>    We have learned that hiring the differently abled gives us a </info>
    <info>competitive advantage. The United States and other nations are now </info>
    <info>facing shortages of workers, and yet we have a great untapped natural </info>
    <info>resource in the differently abled. Employers will learn that those with </info>
    <info>differing abilities are an asset, not a liability. And the employers </info>
    <info>who learn this lesson the fastest, will be at an advantage and find </info>
    <info>greater success.</info>
    <info>    Our governments need to make changes too. We need to see the </info>
    <info>differently abled as full-fledged citizens, people able to contribute, </info>
    <info>not helpless beings who need pity. We need laws that guarantee the same </info>
    <info>rights--including the same wages--as the neuro-typical population. Here </info>
    <info>in the U.S., the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 allows employers to </info>
    <info>pay the people with disabilities less than a minimum wage. We are </info>
    <info>working with the National Down Syndrome Society to support passage of </info>
    <info>the TIME Act to afford all people a fair, minimum wage.</info>
    <info>    In the U.S. and elsewhere, we have benefits programs that limit the </info>
    <info>ability of the disabled to work. Our colleagues with disabilities work </info>
    <info>part-time. Why? Because if they work too many hours, they will lose </info>
    <info>their Medicaid and they cannot afford to do so. Take Aliya, who has a </info>
    <info>form of autism and works as a Sock Wrangler. Aliya does a great job and </info>
    <info>would love to work 40 hours per week but cannot because she cannot </info>
    <info>afford to lose her Medicaid. Don't we all want Aliya to work full-time? </info>
    <info>Then why have laws that limit how much she can work?</info>
    <info>    And my son John, he does not receive benefits yet. However, when he </info>
    <info>needs those benefits in the future, he will need to choose between his </info>
    <info>benefits and equity in the company that he has created. Do we want to </info>
    <info>prevent people from engaging in entrepreneurship?</info>
    <info>    It is time to decouple the poor from the disabled in our means-</info>
    <info>tested programs so that people with differing abilities can work full-</info>
    <info>time and maximize their contributions to society. We want to encourage </info>
    <info>people to work and to pay taxes, so let's remove the disincentives to </info>
    <info>work.</info>
    <info>    In the end, our message is simple. It is good business to hire </info>
    <info>people with differing abilities. John created his own future when he </info>
    <info>created John's Crazy Socks. We need more businesses that offer a future </info>
    <info>of meaningful work to all people. Employers here in the U.S. and around </info>
    <info>the world will come to learn that people with differing abilities make </info>
    <info>great employees.</info>
    <info>    John and I are a couple of simple guys from Long Island, a couple </info>
    <info>of knuckleheads selling socks. We have no special training and no </info>
    <info>special talents. If we can do this, anyone can. No more excuses. Let's </info>
    <info>show the world what is possible.</info>
